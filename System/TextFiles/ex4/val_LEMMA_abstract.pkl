VThe Antarctic region of the globe is of special importance for a wide range of study of global change . The IGBP research activity needing special focus for global change should be multidisciplinary , should involve both the geosphere and the biosphere , and should be of global a well a local interest . There are a number of important Antarctic research topic which fit these criterion . A decrease of Antarctic sea ice ha a positive feedback on global warming . Reduction in the sea ice also impact on deep ocean circulation and can give a positive feedback to the increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide by the reduction of a deep ocean sink . Changes in the mass balance of the Antarctic ice sheet impact on global sea level . A unique historic record of past climate and global environmental change is being obtained from deep core drilling in the Antarctic ice sheet . Decreases of stratospheric ozone are most pronounced over the Antarctic in spring . The impact of increase in ultraviolet radiation on the biosphere can be studied in the Antarctic a a precursor to possible change developing elsewhere around the globe . Changes in the atmosphere and ocean circulation resulting from the decrease in Antarctic sea ice cover can have important effect on ocean surface temperature which impact on the climate of the continent . These topic are discussed briefly and a number of Antarctic research area are highlighted which build on existing or planned international programme and which can make critical contribution to multidisciplinary study of global change .

aVConcluding ten year of study , the U.S. National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program ( NAPAP ) recently issued it integrated assessment report designed to provide guidance to policy maker on the source and effect of acid deposition , and the cost and benefit of alternative control measure . This paper focus on an evaluation of the benefit-cost implication of acid rain control a revealed by two of the five major question addressed in the NAPAP assessment framework . While the NAPAP effort made significant scientific contribution to the study of acid deposition , key gap are found in the assessment of benefit and cost most relevant to policy decision . Lessons learned from NAPAP may be helpful in avoiding similar problem in assessing emerging environmental issue such a global climate change .

aVIn order to alleviate the threat of global climate change , coordinated international action is needed . This cooperation should include multilateral agreement and new economic initiative to help implement measure that will slow the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the Earth 's atmosphere due to tropical deforestation and fossil-fuel use . An international market in environmental service can help to safeguard the Earth 's climate and foster economic development through a North-South transfer of financial resource . We suggest international carbon-emission offset ( ICEOs ) a a mean by which international market , under a policy umbrella such a a multilateral climate-protection treaty , could trade carbon-saving service . Such a market would provide a currency for rewarding action that reduce global carbon emission , allowing carbon emitter to seek the least expensive way to reduce emission . This currency would transfer cash and/or debt relief from industrialized nation to developing nation , allowing the developing nation to profit from the use of clean energy technology and the protection , rather than depletion , of tropical forest .

aVThere have been numerous proposal for immediate cutback in CO2 emission . Proponents argue that sizable reduction are necessary a a hedge against unacceptably rapid change in climate . This paper provides a decision tree analysis of the problem . We examine how the optimal hedging strategy might vary with : a ) the damage potential associated with the continued buildup of greenhouse gas ; b ) the accuracy and timing of climate research ; and , c ) the prospect for new supply and conservation technology . The analysis is from the perspective of a single country , the USA . Optimal hedging strategy need to be explored on a region-by-region basis .

aVThe earth 's climate may currently be undergoing a warming in response to the well documented accumulation of CO2 and other greenhouse gas . Changes in forestland area and biomass are playing a role in the accumulation . This paper review and offer some observation on estimate of the role of forest in the carbon cycle . The temperate forest are roughly in carbon balance , with biomass growth equaling or exceeding loss . The tropical forest , by contrast , are a carbon source with forest area declining due primarily to land-use change . A number of carbon-sequestering source , such a wood construction and landfill , may be sequestering more carbon than is commonly assumed . Climate change can also affect forest . A number of mechanism that influence forest growth and composition are discussed . In the absence of increased precipitation and/or a CO2 `` fertilization '' effect , warming is likely to diminish forest area and biomass . Forest burning is part of the natural cycle . During a burn , carbon is released through the post-burning period and typically involves carbon sequestering a the result of regeneration and vigorous growth . In an undisturbed natural system , a steady-state level of global forest biomass would be reached . Anthropogenic factor can upset the natural steady state . In a period of rapid climate transition , such a might accompany a global warming , forest are likely to lose vigor and thus be particularly susceptible to wildfire .

aVBritish Coal measure their methane emission at 0.8 +/- 0.2 million tonne from UK coal mining in 1987 . However , this figure can not be verified until British Coal release relevant data . Recently , the US Environmental Protection Agency ha endorsed the use of an emission equation a a mean of calculating methane emission from coal mining . Methane emission from coal mining rise to 1.19 - 2.21 Mt when this equation is applied to the UK . Both these estimate represent a lost resource and a major global warming effect due to methane 's potency a a greenhouse gas .

aVLate Paleocene to middle Eocene clay mineral association have been considered at fifteen location from the Atlantic Ocean and the adjacent sector of the Southern Ocean , and compared to the result of previous investigation . Globally warm climate and alternating wet and arid season are deduced from the widespread abundance of pedogenic smectite at every location . Near the Paleocene-Eocene boundary , enhanced humidity at high latitude and in continental hinterland is indicated by more abundant kaolinite , while in coastal area from low and middle latitude increased aridity resulted in more abundant palygorskite ( and/or sepiolite ) . Concomitant increase of kaolinite and fibrous clay are correlated with lower delta-O-18 of benthic and planktonic foraminifer in most oceanic area , indicating that warmer condition were associated with enhanced evaporation at low to middle latitude , and increased precipitation at high latitude . This is consistent with an improvement of meridional transfer of energy , which probably contributed to the compensation of the equator to pole thermal disequilibrium increased by the global warming . During the middle Eocene , both kaolinite and palygorskite content decreased at most southern location , coeval with higher delta-O-18 . Inferred cooling and reduced thermal exchange especially characterized the southern high latitude , and possibly resulted from plate tectonic evolution .

aVThe potential of CO2 emission reduction is analyzed by the MARKAL model for the Japanese energy system in the time horizon 1985 approximately 2030 , taking into account such reduction measure a energy conservation , fuel switching , and technology substitution . Among them , nuclear energy utilization is found to have a large CO2 reduction potential , i.e . from 10 % reduction of the total emission in 1990 to the level of 16 % , 21 % and 42 % in year 2000 , 2010 and 2030 , respectively , through electric power generation and process heat application .

aVAn integrated approach for choosing among energy supply- and demand-side measure show that , compared to business-as-usual demand pattern , global greenhouse-gas emission can be reduced well below current level with net economic benefit to society . Given these finding , a 'wait-and-see ' stance towards new initiative in energy and environmental policy is not economically justifiable . Achieving significant emission reduction , however , will require commitment to policy aimed at enabling energy market to function more efficiently and supporting legislation where market force do not suffice .

aVIncreasing concentration of CO2 and other greenhouse gas in the atmosphere can be directly related to global warming . In term of human health , because a major cause of increasing atmospheric concentration of CO2 is the increased combustion of fossil fuel , global warming also may result in increase in air pollutant , acid deposition , and exposure to ultraviolet ( UV ) radiation . To understand better the impact of global warming phenomenon on human health , this review emphasizes the process that are responsible for the greenhouse effect , air pollution , acid deposition , and increased exposure to UV radiation .

aVComputer model predict that clear sign of the greenhouse effect should have appeared a a consequence of increase in greenhouse gas , equivalent to a 50 % increase in carbon dioxide in the last 100 year . The prediction are contradicted by the climate record in nearly every important respect . Contrary to the model : ( 1 ) the Northern Hemisphere ha not warmed more than the Southern Hemisphere , ( 2 ) high latitude have not warmed more than low latitude , and ( 3 ) the U.S. ha not shown the predicted warming trend , although this is the largest area in the world for which well-distributed , reliable record are available . Finally , all of the computation of the greenhouse effect show an accelerating increase in temperature in the 1980s , reflecting the rapid increase in greenhouse gas in recent year . However , measurement from orbiting satellite with a precision of 0.01-degrees-C show no trend to higher temperature in the 1980s .

aVVery stable halocarbon such a chlorofluorocarbon ( CFCs ) and carbon tetrachloride are responsible for both the stratospheric ozone depletion and the global warming a they accumulate in the atmosphere . Background atmospheric concentration of CFCs and other halocarbon have been determined accurately and precisely at surface level both in the northern hemisphere ( Hokkaido ) and in the southern hemisphere ( Antarctica ) . The atmospheric concentration of CFC-11 and CFC-12 have been increasing by 4 % a year since 1979 ; the CFC-113 concentration tends to increase much faster ( 10-20 % a year ) . Vertical profile of major CFCs upto the stratosphere a determined in balloon experiment ( grab-sampling and cryogenic sampling ) over Japan reflect their behavior in the stratospheric UV photolysis .

aVProjected change in global climate have substantial ramification for biological diversity and the management of natural area . We explored the potential implication of global climate change for biogeographic pattern in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem by using a conceptual model to compare three likely climate scenario : ( 1 ) warmer and drier than the present ; ( 2 ) warmer and drier , but with a compensating increase in plant water use efficiency ; and ( 3 ) warmer and wetter than the present . The logical consequence of each scenario are projected for several specie and community type chosen to represent a range of local climate condition and biotic response in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem . The upper and lower timberline appear to be particularly sensitive to climate change . The upper timberline is likely to migrate upward in elevation in response to temperature change , whereas the lower treeline may retreat under drier condition or move down slope under wetter condition . In all scenario , the extent of alpine vegetation in the ecosystem decreased . Climate-induced change in the fire regime in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem would probably have substantial consequence for the extent and age-class distribution of forest community . Alterations in the distribution and extent of grassland community would affect the population of large ungulate . Our analysis suggest direction for establishing long-term measurement for the early detection of response to climate change .

aVThe prospect of global warming and consequent sea level rise will have important implication for coastal community . This article examines the land use implication of alternate sea level rise scenario on the city of Myrtle Beach , South Carolina . Current trend a well a high and low sea level rise scenario are superimposed on the city 's beach profile and near shore contour to estimate the type and value of land development likely to be impacted . It is found that loss associated with accelerated sea level rise would be particularly high in the city 's hotel district and that overall property loss could range from 21 to 60 % of the city 's total property value . To lessen these potential loss , coastal community such a Myrtle Beach must choose among one of three policy option including : ( 1 ) barricade the beach , ( 2 ) raise the land , and ( 3 ) implement a strategic retreat . Specific alternative within each of these option are explored in turn . The article concludes that successful development plan will incorporate ground rule sensitive to and consistent with dynamic coastal process .

aVThis paper present a methodology for comparing the cost-effectiveness of different technical option for the abatement of greenhouse gas emission . The methodology also allows a determination of the extent to which each technology can contribute to abatement by a specified date . The primary focus of the paper concern carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) emission . The analysis concludes that of seventeen different abatement option examined , the nuclear option is the most expensive , except for the marginal CO2 saving achieved from advanced coal technology . A combination of energy efficiency measure and high efficiency gas-fired generation can achieve CO2 saving approaching 285 million tonne per year by year 2005 . This represents a saving of 46.5 % over existing emission from the stationary sector ( ie excluding transport ) . If the analysis is extended to include the effect of methane emission from fossil fuel cycle , the advantage of energy efficiency and the renewable generating source is improved .

aVGlobal warming could result in a rise in global mean sea level of 9-29 cm between 1990 and 2030 . By the end of the 21st century , global mean sea level could stand 30-110 cm higher than in 1990 . Those projection suggest that sea level could rise between 3 and 10 cm per decade during the next century . This is a marked acceleration over the increase of 1-2 cm per decade observed during the past century . How will local government and citizen respond ? What are the obstacle to local government and public cognition of , and response to , sea-level rise ? This paper review some of the basic issue involved in responding to accelerated sea-level rise ; the range of possible policy response ; the extent to which local government and the public perceive and respond to threat of sea-level rise ; and the need for research into the determinant of cognition and response .

aVIn their research article `` Precise monitoring of global temperature trend from satellite , '' R. W. Spencer and J. R. Christy assert ( 1 ) that satellite microwave sounding unit ( MSUs ) exhibit superb stability and may be used to monitor global warming in a way that is not possible by other mean .

aVVery little attention ha been paid to the impact of global warming , especially sea level rise , on coastal dune-scapes , despite the fact that these provide natural protection along many of the world 's shoreline . This paper review likely response given the IPCC climate change prediction to 2030AD , which include sea level rise in the order of 0.09 to 0.29m . It is envisaged that coastal dune will react in a variety of way dependent both on regional and local factor . Rising water level will increase susceptibility to erosion , but the fate of released sediment , particularly the onshore/offshore partitioning , must depend on morphodynamic antecedence , and the propensity for periodic domain shift . The release of material at the shoreline may allow construction of coastal dune , to the point of progradation in some zone . The response of dune vegetation to a warmer , wetter climate is uncertain . Most of the main temperate dune specie are C3 plant which given favourable condition would respond positively to CO2 enhancement . However local factor may offset such potential gain .

aVBased on discussion at a Session of the Intergovernmental Committee on Climate Change Working Group 1 held during the period February 26 - March 2 , 1990 in Great Britain , and in the context of the WG-1 Report , a review ha been made of the state-of-the-art of study on global climate change . A consensus ha been reached on one of the most important conclusion that the cause of the climate warming observed during the last century remain still unclear . This determines the top urgency of study and quantitative assessment of the internally forced variability of the climate system , without which the `` filtering-out '' of anthropogenic impact on climate can not be reliable . Such insufficiently studied factor of climate formation a ocean-atmosphere and cloud-radiation interaction are the most substantial aspect of the internal variability . The related unsolved problem have been discussed .

aVHuman activity is altering the composition of the atmosphere in unprecedented way . Fossil fuel combustion , which currently release 5.6 billion metric ton of carbon annually , in combination with deforestation , ha increased atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide 25 % above pre-industrial level . Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas trap infrared radiation from the earth altering it thermal balance . While carbon dioxide is anticipated to contribute about one-half of human induced global warming , the world energy sector is responsible for an estimated 57 % of future global warming when contribution from additional combustion related pollutant are included . In order to stabilize atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide even at current elevated level , computer model suggest the need to reduce emission rate by approximately 75 % . Present pattern of energy use are also contributing to major air pollution problem . An analysis of policy option show that a combination of vastly improved energy efficiency strategy and carbon free energy production technology are essential to simultaneously slow the rate of global warming and improve air quality . This paper summarizes current knowledge of the greenhouse effect and it consequence , and examines how photovoltaic electricity can contribute to atmospheric stabilization goal . Some specific example and strategy will be given that may accelerate the rate at which photovoltaic technology can penetrate the market . Should these strategy succeed , it will have major implication for material science including increased attention to pollution problem associated with the manufacture of many promising photovoltaic technology .

aVTo avoid the risk of global warming energy conservation is becoming increasingly important . In small and medium-sized firm there are still many obstacle to using all profitable energy-saving investment and organizational measure . In a recent study detailed technical analysis in eitht industry , a well a in-depth interview and a broad telephone survey with firm , were carried out . As a conclusion a bundle of activity is suggested to overcome the obstacle . Above all , these include the motivation of company manager , improved energy consultation , the use of the multiplicator function of the association and a stronger engagement of the state and the utility .

aVTHE prospect of global warming ha focused attention on the role of palaeoecology in testing the accuracy and sensitivity of climate-model prediction , in identifying past analogue for future climate change , and in placing model-predicted climate response in the context of natural climate variability 1,2 . Proxy data for climate reconstruction can be derived from many source , including the palaeolimnological record 3,4 . In closed-basin lake in arid and semi-arid region , shift in effective moisture lead to the concentration or dilution of dissolved salt , and these change in salinity are clearly reflected in the composition of lacustrine diatom assemblage 5-8 . Here we refine a previously published 9 diatom-based transfer function for the reconstruction of past change in salinity of lake in the northern Great Plains region of North America , and apply the refined transfer function to a late-glacial and Holocene sediment record from Devils Lake , North Dakota . Our result show that there were a number of alternation between fresh and saline condition during the Holocene and hence demonstrate the utility of the technique in reconstructing past change in regional climate .

aVThe large 1950s fire that burned > 5500 km2 of land across a south-to-north climatic gradient in northern Quebec provide an opportunity to evaluate the role of fire in forest-tundra development on a demographic basis . The tree population density before and almost-equal-to 30 yr after fire wa estimated by censusing tree in plot of 400 m2 located in upland and lowland within four representative ecoregions of northern Quebec . The analysis of tree recruitment before and after fire , in 410 randomly selected site along a transect crossing the upper boreal forest and forest-tundra zone , indicated that wildfire induced substantial depletion of tree population . Taken a a whole , fire have significantly reduced the density of black spruce population in forest-tundra upland , but not in the lowland . A reduction in tree population density of greater-than-or-equal-to 75 % wa observed in 22 % of upper boreal forest site , and 45 % and 93 % of site located in the forest and shrub subzones , respectively , of the forest-tundra zone . Complete exclusion of tree population by fire wa observed in 43 % of upland site in the northern part of the transect , while complete removal wa a rare event in the southern part . Sustained reduction of tree population density after several destructive fire appears a one of the main deforestation process in the subarctic zone . This lead to the patchy distribution of forest stand and scattered tree population typical of the forest-tundra biome . Comparisons with paleoecological data suggest that the impact of the 1950s fire contributed to the expansion of the forest tundra into the upper boreal forest . The ecological impact of these fire wa probably similar to those fire responsible for development of the forest tundra during the Holocene . It is suggested that the fire-climate interaction should be considered in order to predict the ecological impact of warming climate on high-latitude forest ecosystem .

aVThe majority of the scientific community involved in climate research is convinced of the reality of a current and future global warming due to the greenhouse effect , a change that must be largely caused by human activity . However , a minority of scientist is still skeptical of the notion that mankind is significantly influencing the climate of the earth , and it therefore argues against taking certain measure to avert this alleged global warming . In recent year the medium have given considerable coverage to the statement of these skeptic . Reasons for their statement range from a simple argument that we do not understand the earth 's climate system well enough to predict the future , to more complex argument involving negative feedback and change of solar activity . They question whether the global temperature increase in this century of up to 0.6 K is primarily a result of worldwide burning of fossil fuel . The purpose of this article is to show that the statement of this skeptical school of thought need to be critically analyzed ( and in some case refuted ) in the light of current understanding of the planetary system that determines our climate . There is also another school of thought that agrees about the reality of present and future global warming , and claim that this will be beneficial for most of mankind and that it should be encouraged . The policy implication of the latter view are in many respect similar to those of the group that are not convinced that a significant global warming will occur . Both school of thought argue against taking immediate step to slow the climate change .

aVCotton ( Gossypium hirsutum L. ) requires warm day and relatively warm night for optimum growth and development . However , in many area of the cotton belt , sub- and super-optimal temperature frequently occur , both early and late in the season , resulting in altered growth and development . The purpose of this research wa to quantify plant response to temperature , so that these response could be incorporated into plant growth model used to manage cotton crop . Plants , initially grown out of door in pot , were moved into sunlit , temperature-controlled growth chamber 5 d prior to initial bloom . Growth and development were studied in 20/10 , 25/15 , 30/20 , 35/25 , and 40/30-degrees-C day/night temperature regime from initial bloom . Temperature significantly affected phenology , leaf expansion , internode elongation , biomass production and the partitioning of assimilates to different plant part . Optimum temperature for biomass production wa 30/20-degrees-C , with 40 and 50 % le biomass at 20/10 and 40/30-degrees-C , respectively . By 49 d after initial bloom , 13 , 15 and 43 % of the biomass had been partitioned to boll and square at 20/10 , 25/15 and 30/20-degrees-C , respectively , reflecting to some extent slower development at the temperature lower than 30/20-degrees-C . Above 30/20-degrees-C , most of the square and boll were aborted . The growth of the main-stem and it successive leaf at 30/20-degrees-C wa rapid initially , but wa restricted later due to competition with boll for available carbohydrate . The quantification of growth and developmental rate over a wider range of temperature will enable u to predict crop performance if temperature increase a a result of global climate change .

aVSophisticated computer model have been employed by the United Nations Environment Programme 's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) to ass past variation of world climate and to project possible trend over the next century . Attention ha focused on the growing concentration of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) and other greenhouse gas that contribute to global warming . Critics in scientific and policy profession hold that simulation model are not yet adequate to guide policy decision . Many western government dissent from this judgment and insist that a 20 % reduction in CO2 emission should be achieved within 15 year and that remedial policy must be adopted to prevent catastrophic climate change . The proposed remedy range from saving tropical rain forest to forced conservation of energy or taxation of fossil-fuel combustion . A consensus is emerging in the scientific community to endorse a 'no regret ' policy that involves buying various kind of 'insurance ' against future global warming .

aVThe impact of crop loss on the U.S. economy are analyzed using a Computable General Equilibrium ( CGE ) Model . In doing so , concern about widespread crop loss due to a global climate change or environmental event are addressed . The CGE approach allows for analysis of the interaction between supply and demand within agricultural market a well a between these market and the rest of the economy . The result suggest that policy response which allow free market pricing signal to determine production mitigate the effect of an event that approximates the drought of 1988 .

aVGlobal climate change could have a significant impact on the Great Lakes . A number of study of the potential effect of climate change on the Great Lakes were commissioned by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , using common scenario of global warming derived mainly from general circulation model . These study found that a doubling of carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere could eventually lower Great Lakes water level by 0.5 to 2.5m ; reduce ice cover by 1 to 2 1/2 month ; lengthen shipping season while increasing shipping and dredging cost ; reduce dissolved oxygen level in shallow lake basin ; and increase fish productivity . Measures should be taken in the near future to anticipate many of these impact and mitigate their effect or avoid costly political issue .

aVGlobal warming is occurring , the only question is what will be the magnitude of the temperature change and the temporal and spatial distribution ? Existing model predict that the greatest change from present climatic condition will happen in the polar region . In the Arctic , continuous permafrost exists and climatic warming could have severe consequence . In this paper the consequence of global warming on the active layer are examined . Soil temperature data were collected over a four-year period at a field site near Toolik Lake , Alaska . A finite-element , two-dimensional , heat conduction model with phase change wa used to predict soil temperature at the site . After verification that the model could be used with confidence to predict the soil thermal regime , various climatic warming scenario were used a input to estimate the thermal response for the next fifty year . The impact of climatic warming on the thickness of the active layer is reported .

aVLow-lying Holocene coastal plain supporting freshwater wetland are often close to or even below the level reached by the highest tide . The vulnerability of such freshwater system to saltwater intrusion will increase should the sea level rise a a consequence of global warming . In area with a large tidal range , one of the main process inducing a reversion to saltwater influence is likely to be the rapid extension of tidal-creek system . This is demonstrated with an example from the coastal plain of the Mary River in northern Australia , where tidal-creek system have extended more than 30 km inland in 50 year , invading freshwater wetland and destroying associated vegetation over an area of at least 17 000 ha . Networks have grown at an exponential rate through a combination of headward extension along main channel and tributary development . Large tidal range , very small elevational difference over the plain , the presence of incompletely infilled paleochannels , and uncontrolled feral buffalo have been major factor contributing to the rapid rate of expansion .

aVGASEOUS sulphur dioxide supplied to the atmosphere is removed principally by three process : direct scavenging in precipitation , oxidation to aerosol sulphate with subsequent deposition by vertical and horizontal precipitation , and 'dry ' deposition , primarily on the surface of vegetation . The rate of these removal process , which vary with environmental condition , must be known in order to understand the fate of SO2 and the concentration and distribution of aerosol sulphate 1-3 . The latter is thought to play a part in the heat balance of the lower troposphere 4 , and is thus relevant to the issue of global warming . Approaches to this problem using field observation 5,6 have not given consistent or uncontested result . We report here the use of cosmogenic S-35 ( half-life 87.2 day ) a a way of determining the time constant for oxidation , in-cloud scavenging and aerosol deposition . Our method involves determining S-35 level in gaseous SO2 , aerosol sulphate and precipitation . If these seasonally and regionally variable time constant can be applied to terrestrially produced SO2 , S-35 measurement could provide an independent method for studying the fate Of SO2 in the atmosphere a a function of time and place .

aVClimate , vegetation , and fire are interrelated so that any change in one will affect the others . Increases in greenhouse gas , especially carbon dioxide , are expected to increase average surface temperature and alter precipitation pattern . These change will alter numerous biochemical process of vegetative community . Changes in growth rate , carbon allocation pattern , nutrient cycling , and competitive interaction will lead to direct change in the structure and specie composition of many plant community . Major shift in vegetation zone will occur in many region . Climate change will affect fire potential by influencing the frequency and severity of weather favorable for fire . Climate-driven change in the structure and composition of plant community will also affect fire potential by altering the physical and chemical property of fuel . Changes in timing and severity of fire will modify the rate at which community respond to climate change . This in turn will alter fuel property , further modifying fire potential . Changes in fire regime will directly affect the chemistry of the atmosphere by modifying vegetation and emitting gas and particulate matter . The expected rate and magnitude of these change raise question for the continued integrity , vitality , and stability of current ecosystem .

aVAlthough nuclear energy is a low CO2 energy system , it is not a very efficient tool for rapidly reducing carbon emission . Global climate change doe not justify a considerably increased global nuclear programme for the next two to three decade . Even if for other political or socioeconomic reason such an intensive global nuclear programme were initiated , it impact on CO2 emission would be only marginal . This is true irrespective of the cost and feasibility of alternative emission reduction strategy , such a energy efficiency measure , or the availability of other low CO2 energy supply .

aVAs part of an effort to ass the potential impact associated with global climate change , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 's Office of Research and Development is supporting global atmospheric chemistry research by developing global scale estimate of volatile organic compound ( VOC ) emission ( excluding methane ) . Atmospheric chemistry model require , a one input , an emission inventory of VOCs . Consequently , a global inventory of anthropogenic VOC emission ha been developed . The inventory includes VOC estimate for seven class of VOCs : paraffin , olefin , aromatics ( benzene , toluene , xylene ) , formaldehyde , other aldehyde , other aromatics , and marginally reactive compound . These class represent general class of VOC compound which posse different chemical reactivity in the atmosphere , The technical approach used to develop this inventory involved four major step . The first step wa to identify the major anthropogenic source of VOC emission in the United States and to group these source into 28 general source group . Source group were developed to represent general category such a `` source associated with oil and natural gas production '' and more specific category such a savanna burning . Emission factor for these source group were then developed using different technique and data base . For example , emission factor for oil and natural gas production were estimated by dividing the United States ' emission from oil and gas production operation by the amount of oil and natural gas produced in the United States . Multiplication of these emission factor by production/consumption statistic for other country yielded global VOC emission estimate for specific source group within those country . The final step in development of the VOC inventory wa to distribute emission into 10-degrees by 10-degrees grid cell using detailed map of population and industrial activity . The result of this study show total global anthropogenic VOC emission of about 110,000 Gg/yr . This estimate is about 10 % lower than global VOC inventory developed by other researcher . The study identifies the United States a the largest emitter ( 21 % of the total global VOC ) , followed by the ( former ) USSR , China , India , and Japan . Globally , fuel wood combustion and savanna burning were among the largest VOC emission source , accounting for over 35 % of the total global VOC emission . The production and use of gasoline , refuse disposal activity , and organic chemical and rubber manufacturing were also found Lo be significant source of VOC emission .

aVSalt-marsh accretion rate wa investigated at site that spanned a gradient in relative rate of sea-level rise in Washington and Oregon . Mean accretion rate over all site wa 3.6 mm yr-1 ( 95 % CI = 2.4 to 4.8 mm yr-1 ) , which exceeded present mean sea-level-rise rate ( 1.3 mm yr-1 ; sd = 0.6 ) . However , a mean rise rate of 5.5 mm yr-1 ( sd = 1.9 ) predicted by a moderate sea-level-change scenario to occur by the year 2050 exceeds mean accretion rate . Marshes with adequate sediment input seemed to have the capacity to keep pace with an increased sea-level-rise rate . Lowest accretion rate were recorded at site with the least sediment supply . Accretion rate showed a weak negative correlation with sediment organic matter ( measured a volatile solid ) and marsh standing stock . The data suggest that moderate and high rise-rate scenario would threaten the existence of salt marsh in the region in the absence of increased sediment supply . A better understanding is required of marsh accretion and predicted rate of sea-level rise to refine prediction of the effect of sea-level rise on Pacific Northwest salt marsh .

aVThe climatic suitability of wine grape class in Europe wa mapped using a latitude-temperature index . It wa found necessary to superimpose a constraint based on a minimum temperature of the coldest month of -3-degrees-C to exclude those area where winter are too severe for vine survival . The index , combined with this constraint , proved a useful indicator of current climatic potential of wine grape . A sensitivity analysis , using arbitrary adjustment to temperature , suggested that even a 1-degrees-C warming could lead to a significant expansion in potential of viticulture . More critical examination , using GCM projection of global warming , and more site or region specific study are recommended .

aVMost study on the global warming issue neglect the impact of proposed measure ( eg carbon tax ) on the economy of the developing country in their anlayses . In this paper , an attempt ha been made to bridge this gap . By using a standard econometric model , the major ( possible ) impact of an OECD carbon tax on developing country under different policy option were examined . Implementing a carbon tax policy could set serious restriction to the developmental effort of the developing country . The role of non-commercial energy-use vis-a-vis global warming wa also investigated . The need for a global perspective when designing effective environmental policy is inevitable .

aVSimulation modeling wa applied to predict the response of northeast Florida coastal wetland to future sea level rise due to global warming . Remote sensing and geographic information system ( GIS ) were used to develop , manipulate , and synthesize model input including land cover , digital elevation data , and site characteristic data . The SLAMM3 model evaluated the input data to predict response of coastal wetland and lowland to inundation and erosion by sea level rise , and determined transfer from one habitat to another on a cell-by-cell basis . Significant change were predicted from different scenario of sea level rise : 0.5 m , 1.0 m , and 1.25 m. The simulation indicated that 31.9 percent and 40.0 percent of wetland within the study area would be lost with a 1.0 m and 1.25 m sea level rise , respectively , while 6.5 percent would be lost with 0.5 m rise .

aVGlobal warming due to increased concentration of atmospheric CO2 is expected to be amplified in middle and higher latitude . Consequently , ecosystem in these latitude will experience more pronounced climatic variation . This investigation attempt to ass the sensitivity of Canada 's ecosystem to climatic change . Potential ecological impact resulting from global warming are outlined . With this background , the effect of a doubled CO2 climate are applied to a classification model derived from the current ecological setting . Results reveal not only major shift in ecological boundary but also change in the character of these broadly distributed ecosystem .

aVA soil climosequence in tussock grassland in South Island , New Zealand , encompassing climate ranging from cold to warm temperate provided a spatial analogue of climate change for investigating the effect of global warming on soil C content and turnover . Mean annual temperature ( T ) and annual precipitation ( P ) ranged from 2 to 10-degrees-C , and 350 to 5000 mm , respectively . Soil C content were curvilinearly related to T/P across the sequence ( r = -0.95 , significant at P < 0.01 ) , indicating that east of the Southern Alps , increased decomposition of organic matter with global warming would provide a positive feedback to further increase atmospheric CO2 . This decrease in New Zealand 's soil C , estimated to be up to 10 % of the current content for a global temperature rise of 0.03 K a-1 to 2050 , could contribute about 0.5 x 10 ( 15 ) g C to the atmosphere over the next 60 year . These conclusion were generally supported by change in soil C turnover estimated from 'bomb ' C-14 enrichment . The unexpectedly slow turnover found for two soil wa explained by a 'memory ' effect from the former southern beech forest that grew on these soil in prehistoric time . Accumulation of Al-humus under the forest may be responsible for the slow C turnover observed .

aVThe interaction between energy and the environment ha been recognized for some time , but increasing focus is being placed on the feedback mechanism between the two a local/regional and federal government address the issue of regional pollution and global climate change , respectively . In Los Angeles the continued severity of the air pollution problem ha stimulated renewed effort to significantly curtail emission to meet the health-related air quality standard . This paper provides an overview of the ambient air quality in Los Angeles , the impact of previous emission control strategy , and the additional reduction in emission required to meet the health-related air quality standard ( Air Quality Management Plan , 1991 ) The paper focus upon the role of clean technology such a the fuel cell to effect the emission reduction required . Finally , there is a discussion of the demonstration program , planned or underway , with fuel cell and related technology in the South Coast Air Quality Management District ( SCAQMD ) , followed by some comment on the regulatory and legislative action underway to stimulate new technology .

aVCarbon storage and dynamic are receiving increasing attention because of the hypothesized role of CO2 in global climate change . This study wa carried out to determine total C storage in Lake States ' forest , including C in biomass , forest floor , and mineral soil . Over-story tree were measured and sample of both forest floor and mineral soil ( to 1 m ) were collected from plot in 169 forest stand across Minnesota , Wisconsin , and Michigan . Five forest type were represented : balsam fir , Abies balsamea ( L. ) Mill . ; jack pine , Pinus banksiana Lamb . ; red pine , P. resinosa Ait . ; aspen , Populus tremuloides Michx . ; and northern hardwood dominated by sugar maple , Acer saccharum Marsh . There were no strong geographic trend in C storage in biomass , forest floor , or mineral soil across the study area . Storage differed significantly among forest type . Each major C pool wa related to a different set of descriptor . Total C storage , the sum of all pool , wa related to forest type , stand age , available water , actual evapotranspiration , and soil day content , explaining about 65 % of the variation . Use of soil and site descriptor did not completely account for the strong effect of forest type on C storage . Differences in the size of C pool , a related to time since disturbance and forest type , indicate that C storage in forest of the Lake States can be influenced by forest management activity . Patterns of C storage in these moist temperate ecosystem are not a strongly influenced by climatic variable a is C storage in grassland to the west .

aVIn Thailand , the world 's largest rice exporter , rice constitutes a major export on which the economy of the whole country depends . Climate change could affect rice growth and development and thus jeopardize Thailand 's wealth . Current climatic condition in Thailand are compared to prediction from four general circulation model ( GCMs ) . Temperature prediction correlate well with the observed value . Predictions of monthly rainfall correlate poorly . Virtually all model agree that significant increase in temperature ( from 1 to 7-degrees-C ) will occur in the region including Thailand following a doubling in atmospheric carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) concentration . The regional seasonality and extent of the rise in temperature varies with each model . Predictions of change in rainfall vary widely between model . Global warming should in principle allow a northward expansion of rice-growing area and a lengthening of the growing season now constrained by low temperature . The expected increase in water-use efficiency due to enhanced CO2 might decrease the water deficit vulnerability of dryland rice area and could make it possible to slightly expand them .

aVAlthough long considered to be of marginal importance to global climate change , tropospheric aerosol contributes substantially to radiative forcing , and anthropogenic sulfate aerosol in particular ha imposed a major perturbation to this forcing . Both the direct scattering of short-wavelength solar radiation and the modification of the shortwave reflective property of cloud by sulfate aerosol particle increase planetary albedo , thereby exerting a cooling influence on the planet . Current climate forcing due to anthropogenic sulfate is estimated to be - 1 to - 2 watt per square meter , globally averaged . This perturbation is comparable in magnitude to current anthropogenic greenhouse gas forcing but opposite in sign . Thus , the aerosol forcing ha likely offset global greenhouse warming to a substantial degree . However , difference in geographical and seasonal distribution of these forcings preclude any simple compensation . Aerosol effect must be taken into account in evaluating anthropogenic influence on past , current , and projected future climate and in formulating policy regarding control on emission of greenhouse gas and sulfur dioxide . Resolution of such policy issue requires integrated research on the magnitude and geographical distribution of aerosol climate forcing and on the controlling chemical and physical process .

aVThe era of cheap fossil fuel is nearing it end . Industrial , agricultural and human pollutant have reached alarming level in water , soil , air and stratosphere . Consumers no longer tolerate poison in their food and water , are now concerned with global warming and ozone depletion , and value field and forest for their scenery and wildlife a well a food and fibre . We are at the crossroad , searching for answer to these and many other pressing ecological problem . On one side sit 'deep ecologist ' who patiently await the reaction of global Gaia . On the other sit 'biotechnologists ' who would design and build new organism and new ecosystem . The first approach is defeatist , for it awaits the decimation of the human population . The other is activist , but will it work ? Here we examine the idea of 'ecological engineering ' , which offer some promise of solution to our problem if it can integrate the practical side of ecosystem , landscape , community and population ecology with relevant formal concept from the engineering science .

aVChanges in seasonal temperature and precipitation , a predicted by several global climate model , were utilized together with a stochastic daily weather stimulation model to evaluate the ecological impact of projected global climate change scenario on temperate forest ecosystem on northern Michigan , USA . The model simulated the impact of these projected change on ecologically significant weather variable , such a the length of the frost-free period , average growing season temperature , average growing season degree day ( 4.4-degrees-C basis ) , summer precipitation , potential evaporation during , the growing season , and the ratio of precipitation to potential evaporation during July and August . The result indicate that even the lower range of predicted climate change could lead to ecologically and commercially significant change in the composition and productivity of these forest . Of particular concern is the possibility of climatically induced regional decline episode for a number of important commercial specie in the northern temperate forest of central North America .

aVAssuming current trend continue , significant global warming via the 'greenhouse effect ' seems-ineVitable ; disequilibrium in physical and biological ecosystem will ensue , and the faster the change occur the le likely it is that human ( and other ) society will be able to adapt without serious resultant consequencesl14 . Natural climatic change in the past have occurred over , thousand or million of year ; global warming of 5000 to 15 000 year ago completely changed the face of the planet 6 ; this wa , howevr , insidious unlike the rapid change which man-made 'global-warming ' will precipitate . Present prediction on extent and geographical distribution of climatic change are based on incomplete scientific projection coupled with a significant quota of crystal-ball gazing ! The potential impact of climatic change on communicable disease pattern can be summarized3 : ( i ) modification of vector ( usually arthropod ) ecology - this relates principally to infection curently prevalent in tropical and subtropical region , ( ii ) intensification of human-related risk factor - including reduced availability and quality of drinking water , cooking and sanitation facility , extent of irrigation , etc , and ( iii ) an increase in soil , airborne and other disease , directly related to the socioeconomic consequence of changed human behaviour .

aVFor the country of Central America , international cooperation in the area of global warming ha sharpened the economic growth v environmental protection tradeoff . This paper simulates two energy future for Central America a a region : a minimum cost ( maximum development ) scenario and a minimum CO2 emission scenario . The tradeoff between these two scenario identify a frontier demonstrating the cost of cutting carbon emission in Central America . As these cost are relatively low , Central America can use them to negotiate treaty , agreement , and eventually the sale of carbon emission right to country or company facing more expensive carbon reduction strategy .

aVIt is generally assumed that healthy , natural ecosystem have the potential to sequester carbon under favorable environmental condition . There is also evidence that CO2 act a a plant fertilizer . It is of interest to know if these assumption are valid and how natural system might respond under future scenario of CO2 increase and possible climate change . Few measurement of the effect of CO2 and global climate change have been made on `` natural '' ecosystem under realistic field condition . Most measurement have been conducted in the synthetic environment of totally controlled greenhouse and growth chamber . Several line of evidence indicate that controlled environment study using plant growing in pot induce experimental artifact that reduce confidence in the use of result for prediction of future global response . Open top chamber are being used in several autecological field study in an attempt to obtain more realistic field environment . A few field microcosm study have been completed and a system for the free air release of CO2 ha been applied in cotton field . Unfortunately , the requirement of large amount of CO2 and financial restriction have precluded the initiation of larger scale field study in natural vegetation . This paper list and summarizes the best field study available but draw heavily on study from artificial environment and condition in an attempt to summarize knowledge of global environmental change on forest and other non-agricultural ecosystem . Finally the paper concludes that there is a need for the development and application of equipment for field measurement in several representative natural ecosystem and make specific recommendation of the creation of a tropical research center .

aVUnrecognized genotype x environment interaction ( g*e ) can bias genetic-gain prediction and model for predicting growth dynamic or specie perturbation by global climate change . This study tested six set of family in 10 plantation site in a 78-thousand-hectare breeding zone . Plantation difference accounted for 71 percent of sum of square ( 15-year height ) , replication an additional 4.4 percent , family 1.9 percent , the first principal component of interaction effect 3.5 percent , and the second principal component 1.2 percent . Results in this study and in a larger survey ( 87 set in 10 breeding zone ) were similar : 51 percent of set indicated significant g*e. In 46 percent of set , the g*e interaction-family variance ratio wa greater than 1 ; in 35 percent , greater than 1.5 ; and in 10 percent , greater than 5 .

aVMuch concern is felt about global warming and many debate have ranged widely on this subject without a yet arriving at a precise answer ; the 'best guess ' at present is a 60 % chance of a global average change in the 1.5-4.5 K range if carbon dioxide concentration were to double . However , regional temperature change are still more speculative depending on the heat retaining property of the ocean and the continent . The reaction of ecosystem to climatic change is here illustrated by considering forest and bird , and it is concluded that the more rapid the climatic change , the higher the probability of disruption and surprise in the ecosystem affected . The author finally recommends the banning of chlorofluorocarbon and switching fuel from coal to natural gas thus buying time and slowing down global warming .

aVOne popular and apocalyptic vision of the world influenced by increasing concentration of infrared-absorbing trace gas is that of ecological disaster brought about by rapidly rising temperature , sea level , and evaporation rate . This vision developed from a suite of climate model that have since considerably changed in both their dynamic and their estimate of prospective warming . Observed temperature indicate that much more warming should already have taken place than predicted by earlier model in the Northern Hemisphere , and that night , rather than day , reading in that hemisphere show a relative warming . A high-latitude polar-night warming or a general night warming could be either benign or beneficial . A large number of plant specie show both increased growth and greater water-use efficiency under enhanced carbon dioxide . An extensive body of evidence now indicates that anthropogenerated sulfate emission are mitigating some of the warming , and that increased cloudiness a a result of these emission will further enhance night , rather than day , warming . The sulfate emission , though , are not sufficient to explain all of the night warming . However , the sensitivity of climate to anthropogenerated aerosol , and the general lack of previously predicted warming , could drastically alter the debate on global warming in favor of le expensive policy .

aVIn this paper we estimate change in California 's annual electricity use and peak demand by 2010 under two global warming scenario . We use each warming scenario to produce an electricity demand projection with end-use energy model . Our analysis focus on the heating and cooling of building and the pumping and transport of water for farm and city . The result suggest global warming ha a moderate effect on electricity demand . Under our worst scenario , a 1.9-degrees-C increase , we project Statewide electricity requirement will increase by about 7 500 GWh ( 2.6 % ) and 2 400 MW ( 3.7 % ) . We conclude discussion with thought on the implication a warmer world may have for energy forecaster and resource planner .

aVNow that government are beginning to consider action to respond to the potential threat of global warming ( even if they do not yet believe that it will definitely occur ) , their representative search the scientific literature for 'clues ' about the positive or negative impact of a few degree Celsius increase in global temperature . There is a growing number of 'guesstimates ' ( often called scenario ) about climate change impact in sub-Saharan Africa . A review of the existing scenario highlight conflicting , if not opposing , view about those impact . Such scenario must be used with caution and labelled a speculation . No single scenario should be used for determining irreversible policy response to the potential regional consequence of global warming .

Dealing with the global warming issue creates further difficulty in adapting the refrigeration and insulation technology for future need a chlorofluorocarbon are phased out of production and use in accordance with the Montreal Protocol . The study reported in this article wa conducted to help industry , government and international policymakers reach sound decision during the change-over from the CFCs to alternative compound and technology .

aVThe Laurentian Great Lakes comprise one of the major water resource of North America . For many water quality study the hydraulic residence time or replacement time of the Great Lakes serve a measure of how quickly water quality will change in response to change in contaminant loading . The residence time for a conservative substance represents the average time a conservative substance which remains dissolved in the water spends in a lake . The hydraulic residence time of conservative substance for the Great Lakes are relatively long ranging , from close to 200 year for Lake Superior to a little over 2 year for Lake Erie . A major reduction of 38 year wa found in the residence time for Lake Michigan ( 62 year a compared with the 100 year value previously reported ) due to the consideration of flow exchange between Lakes Michigan and Huron . This indicates that Lake Michigan may respond much faster to reduction in contaminant loading than previously expected . Because of their low ratio of volume to outflow , only Lakes Erie and Ontario are affected by normal climatic variation of le than 20 year in duration . Extreme lake level condition over the period of 2 to 8 year can also significantly affect the residence time of Lakes Erie and Ontario . Thus high level in the early 1970s may have contributed to the improvement of water quality in Lake Erie . Existing diversion and potential global warming appear to have no significant effect on residence time .

aVBased on the IEA 's Medium Term Model which provides estimate of energy consumption and related variable to the year 2005 , the IEA ha attempted to develop a coherent methodology to quantify approximately the possible effectiveness of response measure in achieving the target of stabilising of CO2 emission at current level by 2005 . Such an analysis by no mean constitutes a full cost benefit evaluation and doe not try to measure the economic or other cost of the measure it evaluates . Also , it should not be viewed a a recommendation or suggestion on how best to counter the long-term accumulation of CO 2 emission . Two type of policy instrument have been assessed : fiscal ; and regulation of supply option . The study ha evaluated four variant : carbon tax ; a 50 % increase in nuclear 's share of power generation ; a combination of these two measure ; and a radically greater use of natural gas .

aVACTUAL and potential increase in aircraft traffic are causing concern about the effect of aircraft exhaust emission on atmospheric chemistry . Model result 1-3 and measurement 4-6 in the Northern Hemisphere have shown that growth in surface emission of nitrogen oxide and hydrocarbon lead to increase in concentration of tropospheric ozone . Tropospheric ozone is toxic to plant , human and other organism , and it is a greenhouse gas 7-9 . The radiative forcing of surface temperature is most sensitive to change in tropospheric ozone at a height of approximately 12 km ( ref . 8 ) , where aircraft emission of nitrogen oxide are at a maximum and where the model sensitivity of ozone to nitrogen oxide emission is enhanced . Our model result show that the radiative forcing of surface temperature is about thirty time more sensitive to aircraft emission of nitrogen oxide than to surface emission . We also find that the impact on global warming of increase in tropospheric ozone caused by increase in surface emission of nitrogen oxide ha previously been overestimated by a factor of five 1,10 , owing to an error in the calculation of the ozone budget .

aVSignificant level of methane are liberated from the coal face and subterranean pocket during coal mining . This methane pose an explosion hazard in mine and when released into the atmosphere , act a a greenhouse gas which contributes to global warming . Methanotrophic bacteria in gas phase bioreactors ( GPBs ) offer the potential to convert this methane to le deleterious substance ; however , it is critical that reaction rate be maximized . The effect of kaolin on rate of methane oxidation by Methylomonas methanica grown in GPBs wa assessed . The amendment of GPBs with a 4 % kaolin solution significantly increased methane removal by M. methaniea versus non-kaolin-amended control . The maximum velocity ( upsilon ( max ) ) were 604.1 mg methane min-1 GPB-1 in the control compared to 1156.6 mg methane min-1 GPB-1 in the kaolin-amended bioreactors , while the Michaelis constant ( K ( m ) ) were 15.87 and 60.52 mg methane GPB-1 , respectively .

aVEnsuring that treaty designed to manage global climate change are 'implementable ' is an important negotiating challenge . Implementable agreement have a reasonable chance of being ratified by nation state that are the greatest contributor to the problem ; are acceptable to party with the resource to do something about it ; and induce voluntary compliance . This article contends that , aside from domestic political characteristic , other factor contributing to effective implementation of international agreement are their structure , requirement , and expectation . Factors that optimize implementable agreement include : a sufficient number of relevant participant in negotiation to enhance their legitimacy ; reliance on confidence-building to deter non-compliance ; stating precisely the signatory obligation ; and designing treaty to be renegotiable in the face of changing scientific , political , and economic condition . Global environmental agreement most likely to obtain signatory compliance will avoid overly stringent standard ; allow variable compliance and discretion in implementation ; consult domestic interest at each stage of agreement 'design ' and execution ; permit transfer of resource and technology ; and rely on 'functional integration ' to build confidence .

aVA fresh-water microalgae , which function under CO2 enriched atmosphere condition , wa isolated and it cultural characteristic were investigated . The HA-1 strain , identified a genus Chlorella , wa newly isolated from a paddy field by an enrichment culture using reproduced stack gas from a thermal power plant with a concentration of CO2 and O2 of 15 % and 2 % respectively . It showed maximum growth at 10 % CO2 enriched air flowing condition , and showed a good growth rate in a broad range of physically controllable condition , including CO2 enriched air flow rate , temperature and pH value . The result indicated the feasibility of the HA-1 strain for mass cultivation using stack gas .

aVHistorical ice record , such a freeze and breakup date and the total duration of ice cover , can be used a a quantitative indicator of climatic change if long homogeneous record exist and if the record can be calibrated in term of climatic change . Lake Mendota , Wisconsin , ha the longest uninterrupted ice record available for any lake in North America dating back to 1855 . These record extend back prior to any reliable air temperature data in the midwestern region of the U.S. and demonstrate significant warming of approximately 1.5-degrees-C in fall and early winter temperature and 2.5-degrees-C in winter and spring temperature during the past 135 year . These change are not completely monotonic , but rather appear a two shorter period of climatic change in the longer record . The first change wa between 1875 and 1890 , when fall , winter , and spring air temperature increased by approximately 1.5-degrees-C . The second change , earlier ice breakup date since 1979 , wa caused by a significant increase in winter and early spring air temperature of approximately 1.3-degrees-C . This change may be indicative of shift in regional climatic pattern associated with global warming , possibly associated with the 'Greenhouse Effect ' . With the relationship between air temperature and freeze and break up date , we can project how the ice cover of Lake Mendota should respond to future climatic change . If warming occurs , the ice cover for Lake Mendota should decrease approximately 11 day per 1-degrees-C increase . With a warming of 4 to 5-degrees-C , year with no ice cover should occur in approximately 1 out of 15 to 30 year .

aVCurrently , little information exists concerning high frequency climate change in the Antarctic , data that are essential to gaining a more complete understanding of global climate change . Sediments from the George V Coast continental margin potentially contain a high resolution record of the late Holocene . The relatively high rate of sedimentation ( approximately 3 mm/year ) and the presence of laminated interval which contain undisturbed sequence make these sediment valuable for future downcore work . In order to utilize diatom assemblage a proxy of paleoclimatic and paleoceanographic parameter , a preliminary study of the surface sediment distribution of diatom from the George V Coast continental margin wa completed . Nitzschia curta ( Van Heurck ) Hasle and Nitzschia kerguelensis ( O'Meara ) Hasle present great potential for tracking the Holocene retreat of ice across the continental shelf of this region . Concentrations of N. curta , an `` ice-related '' form , decrease in an offshore direction , whereas N. kerguelensis , an `` oceanic '' specie associated with circumpolar flow , display an increase in sediment offshore . The genus Thalassiosira Cleve display a clear association with area of open water primary production , a ha been noted in others part of the Antarctic . Downcore variability in relative abundance of this genus will be useful in understanding the history of sea ice versus open water production on the George V Coast shelf . In contrast , the distribution of Chaetoceros Ehrenberg resting spore appears to be more complex , but may be related to the position of the stationary ice edge associated with the annual minimal extent of sea ice . Finally , an understanding of the downcore variability of Thalassiothrix antarctica Schimper ex Karsten , a specie which is very abundant in the laminated section of the sediment core , will have to rely on study of it distribution in other area of the Antarctic , a it is sparsely distributed along the George V Coast today .

aVThis paper ha analysed the major characteristic of long-term variation of summer monsoon climate in South Asia since 1888 . An abrupt enhancement of summer monsoon in the 1920s and it synchronism with the global rapid warming have been detected by the Mann-Kendall Rank Statistic test . Based on diagnostic analysis on the atmospheric circulation over the monsoon region and the thermal condition of both ocean and land during the period of abrupt change , it is found that the warming over land wa stronger and earlier than that over the ocean , which would enhance the land-sea thermal contrast and therefore be favorable to the development of monsoon low and the disturbance in the monsoon flow . This may be a direct factor for the abrupt enhancement of summer monsoon .

aVResults from new simulation of the Early Jurassic climate show that increased ocean heat transport may have been the primary force generating warmer climate during the past 180 m.y . The simulation , conducted using the general circulation model ( GCM ) at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies , include realistic representation of paleocontinental distribution , topography , epeiric sea , and vegetation , in order to facilitate comparison between model result and paleoclimate data . Three major feature of the simulated Early Jurassic climate include the following . ( 1 ) A global warming , compared to the present , of 5-degrees-C to 10-degrees-C , with temperature increase at high latitude five time this global average . Average summer temperature exceed 35-degrees-C in low-latitude region of western Pangaea where eolian sandstone testify to the presence of vast desert . ( 2 ) Simulated precipitation and evaporation pattern agree closely with the moisture distribution interpreted from evaporite , and coal deposit . High rainfall rate are associated primarily with monsoon that originate over the warm Tethys Ocean . Unlike the `` megamonsoons '' proposed in previous study , these system are found to be associated with localized pressure cell whose position are controlled by topography and coastal geography . ( 3 ) Decreases in planetary albedo , occurring because of reduction in sea ice , snow cover , and low cloud , and increase in atmospheric water vapor are the positive climate feedback that amplify the global warming . Similar to other Mesozoic climate simulation , our model find that large seasonal temperature fluctuation occurred over mid- and high-latitude continental interior , refuting paleoclimate evidence that suggests more equable condition . Sensitivity experiment suggest that some combination of ocean heat transport increase , high level of CO2 , and improved modeling of ground hydrological scheme may lead to a better match with the geologic record . We speculate , also , that the record itself is biased toward `` equable '' climatic condition , a suggestion that may be tested by comparing GCM result with more detailed phytogeographic analysis .

aVWe use the GISS global climate model to make a preliminary estimate of Mount Pinatubo 's climate impact . Assuming the aerosol optical depth is nearly twice a great a for the 1982 El Chichon eruption , the model forecast a dramatic but temporary break in recent global warming trend . The simulation indicate that Pinatubo occurred too late in the year to prevent 1991 from becoming one of the warmest year in instrumental record , but intense aerosol cooling is predicted to begin late in 1991 and to maximize late in 1992 . The predicted cooling is sufficiently large that by mid 1992 it should even overwhelm global warming associated with an El Nino that appears to be developing , but the El Nino could shift the time of minimum global temperature into 1993 . The model predicts a return to record warm level in the later 1990s . We estimate the effect of the predicted global cooling on such practical matter a the severity of the coming Soviet winter and the date of cherry blossoming next spring , and discus caveat which must accompany these preliminary simulation .

aVClimatic warming present an imposing problem to scientist everywhere . Its effect in the Arctic is accentuated for several reason . The temperature increase is expected to be greatest in the higher latitude and the ramification of this warming may be more crucial there due to the melting of permafrost . Precipitation change will likely accompany climatic warming in the Arctic , compounding the effect of a temperature increase . The interaction of changing hydrologic and thermal process present a complex problem which would be difficult if not impossible to analyze without the use of detailed computer modeling . To analyze the thermal impact of climatic warming on a permafrost environment , TDHC , a heat conduction model which incorporates phase change , wa used . Then the response of the active layer to climatic warming wa incorporated into HBV , a hydrologic model , to elucidate the effect on the hydrologic regime . Several scenario of climatic warming have been examined to determine the impact on the active layer depth , but only result of 4-degrees-C warming at a typical arctic site will be presented here . In the case of 4-degrees-C warming , three scenario of precipitation were studied : no change , + 15 % , and -15 % . The most obvious and perhaps significant response to climatic warming wa an increase in active layer depth . Other change worth noting were warming of the entire soil profile , increased soil moisture storage , increased evaporation , and variable response in runoff , depending upon the scenario . Evaporation now vies with runoff a the primary loss of moisture from the watershed . If evaporation increase due to a warmer climate , the entire character of arctic hydrology could change , depending on change in precipitation .

aVThe radiative forcing and greenhouse effect due to the atmospheric trace gas have been calculated by using an advanced radiative-convective model developed in this paper . The relationship between radiative forcing and concentration is given for each trace gas . The result show that ( i ) the radiative forcing and then the greenhouse effect are significantly affected by the overlapping of atmospheric absorption band ; ( ii ) the increasing concentration of trace gas other than CO2 , such a CH4 , N2O , CFCs , etc. , may potentially play an important role in the future global warming ; ( iii ) the proposed substitute , such a HCFC124 and HFC125 , for the chlorofluorocarbon which are considered to destroy the ozone layer have still considerable greenhouse effect even though their ozone depletion potential are much smaller than CFCs ; and ( iv ) the feedback process within the earth-atmosphere system have important effect on the surface temperature change due to the radiative forcing to the system .

aVWe constructed a detailed relative sea-level rise curve for the last 1500 year using a novel approach , i.e . charting the rate of relative sea-level rise using microfaunal and geochemical data from a coastal salt marsh sequence ( Clinton , CT , USA ) . The composition of benthic foraminiferal assemblage and the iron abundance in peat were used to describe shift in marsh environment through time quantitatively . The resulting sea-level rise curve , with age control from C-14 dating and the onset of anthropogenic metal pollution , show strong increase in the rate of relative sea-level rise during modem global warming ( since the late nineteenth century ) , but not during the Little Climate Optimum ( AD 1000-1300 ) . There wa virtually no rise in sea-level during the Little Ice Age ( AD 1400-1700 ) . Most of the relative sea-level rise over the last 1200 year in Clinton appears to have occurred during two warm episode that jointly lasted le than 600 year . Changes from slow to fast rate of relative sea-level rise apparently occurred over period of only a few decade . We suggest that change in ocean circulation could contribute to the sudden increase in the rate of relative sea-level rise along the northeastern USA seaboard . Relative sea-level rise in that area is currently faster than the worldwide average , which may result partially from an ocean surface effect caused by hydrodynamics . Our data show no unequivocal correlation between warm period ( on a decaal to centennial time-scale ) and accelerated sea-level rise . One period of acclerated sea-level rise may have occurred between about AD 1200 and 1450 , which wa the transition for the Little Climate Optimum to the Little Ice Age , i.e . a period of cooling ( at least in northwestern Europe ) . Local change in tidal range might also have contributed to this apparent increase in the rate of relative sea-level , however . The second period of accelerated sea-level rise occurred during the period of modem global warming that started at the end of the last century .

aVAccelerated rate of sea level rise and other impact of climate change resulting from global warming are likely to aggravate threat to coastal biodiversity in the United States . Species restricted to or dependent upon a narrow band of habitat close to sea level will be subjected to continuing threat of development from above , and rising sea level from below . In five state alone , almost 500 rare and imperiled specie utilize the coastal fringe below the 10-foot contour . Some 53 specie federally listed a threatened or endangered or a candidate for listing are found only within the narrow band below the 10-foot contour . Rising sea will stress coastal habitat including wetland , barrier island , coral reef , and mangrove , in some case substantially reducing their area . To ensure the conservation of coastal biodiversity global warming must be slowed a much a possible . Steps must also be taken quickly to establish coastal zone policy that allow adaptive response to rising sea by making way for the shoreward movement of coastal ecosystem a sea level change .

aVHatchling loggerhead sea turtle ( Caretta caretta ) were collected over three nesting season from a rookery at Cape Canaveral , Florida . From data on the distribution of nest over the season , we estimated that 92.6-96.7 , 94.7-99.9 , and 87.0-89.0 % of the hatchling produced on this beach in 1986 , 1987 , and 1988 , respectively , were female . These skewed sex ratio were consistent with the fact that for most of the season , sand temperature were above the pivotal level for loggerhead turtle . The present result show that the female-biased sex ratio reported previously by these author for the 1986 nesting season at this site wa not an isolated , atypical event . In addition to a total of 3 year of sampling for sex ratio , measurement of beach temperature at the depth of turtle nest were extended to cover 5 year . These temperature were commonly above the pivotal level . The strongly female-biased hatchling sex ratio found in this population of loggerhead turtle pose theoretical challenge . It may also complicate conservation effort , since global warming might be expected to skew the sex ratio still further toward female .

aVSome of the fundamental problem related to the current approach to global climate change from modelling and observational stand point are discussed . The author offer his personal opinion and suggests caution in term of an all out effort to understand the problem through numerical modelling based on GCMs model . At the same time he advises other approach i.e . statistical and other study of atmospheric phenomenon different from temperature in seeking evidence of climate change . He emphazises in particular the need to find , for political reason and a soon a possible , a clear signal that the greenhouse gas affect is being enhanced and that this ha an impact on the general circulation of the atmosphere .

aVThe paper provides an empirical analysis of the effect on international energy market of policy measure to curb the emission of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) . Model calculation indicate that if CO2 emission are to be stabilized by mean of a carbon tax , very high tax level are required . The concept of cost-effectiveness in designing a global climate convention is discussed . Due to the huge difference in pre-tax energy price , it is argued that a uniform CO2 tax is not necessarily cost-effective . The difference in price level also have important implication for the effect of a CO2 tax on the market for the various fuel .

aVVariabilities in sea-surface temperature and size of the Western Pacific Warm Pool were 1982 to 1991 . The result show that both annual mean sea-surface temperature and the size of the warm pool increased from 1983 to 1987 and fluctuated after 1987 . Possible cause of these variation include solar irradiance variability , El Nino-Southern Oscillation event , volcanic activity , and global warming .

aVThis paper formed the basis of a presentation at the IEA International Conference on 'Technology Responses to Global Environmental Challenges ' in Kyoto , Japan 6-8 November 1991 . It will examine the status of technology in the transportation sector and the penetration of that technology in both the industrialized and developing country . The barrier and constraint to technological progress and the wider dissemination of existing technology may be grouped under five heading : The high priority given to mobility by all people - it is seen a the most important attribute of economic progress after achieving adequate provision for food arid shelter . The structure of urbanization in the 20th century - which ha been based largely on an assumption of personal mobility and/or the availability of transportation infrastructure : road , public transport , etc . The rapid growth in demand for leisure a a consequence of : ( a ) the increase in the non-working population of the industrialized country a life expectancy ha increased ; ( b ) the reduction in both retirement age and working hour a technology advance have allowed more good and service to be provided with substantially lower labour input . The desire for greater personal comfort and independence a economic circumstance improve . Institutional barrier to the transfer of technology . These problem area will be reviewed and some general proposal put forward for enhancing the transfer of technology and resolving some of the sociopolitical issue .

aVThe threat of possible global warming is sufficient to warrant 'least regret ' measure to reduce emission of greenhouse gas and investigation of fallback option , such a carbon dioxide removal from coal-fired power plant . The Global Warming R & D Programme is investigating carbon dioxide removal option , sometimes called 'Low CO2 Power Generation ' . An assessment programme ha estimated the thermal efficiency of a number of process scheme and concluded that gasification based system , with the addition of a CO shift reactor and CO2 scrubber or a membrane gas separator , provide promising approach . A clean hydrogen fuel would be fired in a gas turbine and 90 % of the CO2 removed and exported a a liquid stream for storage in exhausted oil or gas field . Costs of such power plant are now being explored and a collaborative programme is commencing with membrane developer , with the aim of developing and testing membrane for this duty . The paper outline the background and describes preparation for experimental work using CO2/H2 separating membrane .

aVRiver runoff from the world 's major river is an important part of the hydrologic cycle . Runoff change in response to global greenhouse-induced warming will have impact in many area , including agriculture , water resource , and land use . A global atmospheric model is used to calculate the annual river runoff for 33 of the world 's major river for the present climate and for a doubled CO2 climate . The model ha a horizontal resolution of 4-degrees x 5-degrees , but the runoff from each model grid box is quartered and added to the appropriate river drainage basin on a 2-degrees x 2.5-degrees resolution . The computed runoff depends on the model 's precipitation , evapotranspiration , and soil moisture storage . For the doubled CO2 climate , the runoff increased for 25 to the 33 river , and in most case the increase coincided with increased rainfall within the drainage basin . There were runoff increase in all river in high northern latitude , with a maximum increase of 47 % . At low latitude there were both increase and decrease ranging from a 96 % increase to a 43 % decrease . The effect of the simplified model assumption of land-atmosphere interaction on the result is discussed .

aVMany part of the world are presently experiencing a decrease in the daily temperature range , and a number of investigator in the past have suggested that this change in climate may be related to the observed buildup of greenhouse gas . However , other geophysical variable , themselves related to increase in greenhouse gas , may be influencing the daily temperature range . In this investigation , we demonstrate a statistically significant , inverse correlation between the area of North American snow cover and the United States diurnal temperature range . Because global warming is expected to reduce the areal extent of snow cover , the result of this study reveal snow cover should act to increase the diurnal temperature range in the year to come . This climate variable appears therefore to be influencing the daily temperature range counter to other feedback discussed in previous study . Ultimately , our work demonstrates that the direct linkage between the diurnal temperature range and greenhouse gas may be complicated by feedback associated with other geophysical variable .

aVIn this paper we consider the long-term ecological effect of pollutant using three case-studies a example : 'acid rain ' and it effect on forest , soil and aquatic ecosystem ; excess nitrogen deposition from the atmosphere and it effect on natural vegetation , and increased emission of CO2 and it possible climatic and ecological consequence . We point out that the scale of pollution arising from natural human function is considerable given the size of the world human population . Additions to this background from industrial process can be reduced considerably by technical mean , but not eliminated entirely . The same 'contaminants ' associated with industrial energy consumption ( SO2 , NOx , CO2 ) are also produced by natural process . The sum of these three source give rise to a considerable 'irreducible ' minimum background pollution level : the ecological consequence of this need to be explored further .

aVHumans are engaged in an uncontrolled experiment in planetary heating . Each decade , the concentration of CO2 , methane and other greenhouse gas in the atmosphere is increasing by about 4 % . All sign point toward unprecedented rate of warming and climate change . Many plant and animal specie living in natural ecosystem will perish because they will be unable to keep up with shifting climatic zone . Warming exacerbates another biomedical problem - the influx of alien animal , plant and pathogen . These introduced specie , many from the tropic , will not only increase the variety and incidence of tropical disease , but will also affect the quality of the wilderness experience and hence , the popularity of outdoor recreation . Some personal action and political prophylaxis are recommended .

aVProduction of sugar cane in Brazil is 222 million tonne ( harvested wet weight ) /year and is processed to sugar ( 7.5 million tonne ) and ethanol ( 11.8 million m3 ) in 1990 . The use of fossil fuel in sugar cane production is 271 MJ/t of cane . Sugar cane bagasse and ethanol substitute for fuel oil in the food and chemical industry ( including sugar production ) and for gasoline ( 9.75 million m3/year ) , thus avoiding CO2 emission from fossil fuel . Considering the fast carbon cycling in sugar cane production and use , net emission of 9.45 million tonne of C/year are avoided ; this corresponds roughly to 18 % of the total CO2 emission from fossil fuel in Brazil .

aVThe severe urban development pressure on Japanese coastal zone are epitomized in Sagami Bay , one of Tokyo 's key recreational destination . Besides facing grave uncertainty of global warming and tectonic dynamic , this 30-km coastal zone is a stage of many conflict : between residential growth and recreational facility , between dwindling natural beach site and highway construction , and between watersports and fishery . Outlined here is a radical approach in eight step , to be implemented over the next three generation . It call for the abolishment of conventional development idea in favor of the concept of `` envelopment '' instead . This article is derived from the top prize-winning entry to an international idea contest that generated 293 proposal from 27 country , a well a thousand of child 's drawing . It wa sponsored by the Sagamiwan Urban Resort Festival in 1990 Association , the Kanagawa Prefectural Government , a well a by the city authority and municipal government of Yokosuka , Hiratsuka , Fujisawa , Odawara , Chigasaki , Zushi , Miura , Hayama , Oiso , Ninomiya , Manazuru , and Yugawara .

aVThe mechanism that regulate the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , the carbon cycle , is an integral part of the analysis of the greenhouse issue . The present understanding of the carbon cycle is inadequate to the purpose of assessing the relationship between future anthropogenic emission and concentration of atmospheric CO2 . The most important problem is that natural science can not presently explain the relationship between present and past anthropogenetic emission and concentration . Sinks for CO2 are inadequate to explain present and past disposition of emission . This deficiency in scientific understanding lead to uncertainty in the analysis of potential future emission and atmospheric CO2 accumulation , and to uncertainty in the specification of other policy analysis instrument such a global warming potential coefficient .

aVEnvironmental issue such a global warming and ozone layer depletion are now of universal concern . One compound not previously associated with these concern is nitrous oxide ( N2O ) . Worldwide effort to reduce anthropogenic emission are underway . One industrial application that ha recently emerged is N2O abatement from adipic acid plant ( in connection with nylon 6,6 manufacture ) . One possible solution , the catalytic decomposition of N2O , ha long been studied but mainly from an academic standpoint . Some catalyst based on the earlier work were evaluated under pseudo-industrial condition . It is concluded that many factor ( e.g . intrinsic activity , stability , selectivity ) limit the choice of catalyst for this application and that any useful catalyst should be operated within the confines of a process to reduce the rate of thermal deactivation and suppress secondary reaction such a NOx formation . This paper highlight the feature of a catalyst and a catalytic process that can be used to effectively decompose N2O into it constituent part , namely nitrogen and oxygen . The catalytic process is offered for license under the ElimiNox service mark .

aVIn order to quantitatively compare the greenhouse effect of different greenhouse gas a global warming potential ( GWP ) index ha been used which is based on the ratio of the radiative forcing of an equal emission of two different gas , integrated either over all time or up to an arbitrarily determined time horizon . The GWP index is analogous to the ozone depleting potential ( ODP ) index . However , the GWP index is subject to major conceptual difficulty arising from the fact that the atmospheric lifespan for part of the emitted CO2 is , for all practical purpose , infinite . In addition , there are major uncertainty in the atmospheric lifespan and indirect heating effect of the important greenhouse gas , which are reviewed here . An alternative GWP index is proposed which explicitly take into account the duration of capital investment in the energy sector and is le sensitive to uncertainty in atmospheric lifespan and radiative heating than the usual GWP index for time horizon longer than the lifespan of the capital investment . The effect of the GWP index proposed here , compared with previous index , is to shift attention away from short lived gas such a methane and toward CO2 .

aVA clocbe design is described that is suitable for elevating temperature to simulate global warming in polar ecosystem . This cloche system wa used in a manipulation experiment near Ny Alesund , Spitsbergen , Svalbard . An average warming of 2.8 deg . C. wa produced over a 60 day growing season , well within the range predicted by present climate model . The elevation effect is shown to be consistent over the diel cycle and throughout the short arctic summer season . Several advantage over previous design of manipulation unit are highlighted .

aVSoil biological parameter ( e.g. , Collembola ) , soil type , soil chemical parameter ( pH , humus substance ) , and plant community were studied in different ecosystem and ecotones in alpine , subalpine , and spruce forest zone in the Tatra National Park , Slovak Republic . The preliminary , selected data , based on a long-term research program , showed a high sensitivity of some alpine ecotones and ecosystem to long-distance transported acid deposit . The change in different ecosystem parameter since 1977 were more extensive in alpine grassland on limestone than on granite . The greatest soil pH decrease wa in the plant community Festucetum versicoloris ( - 1.5 pH ) , Geranio-Alchemilletum crinitae ( - 1.32 pH ) , and Saxifragetum perdurantis ( - 1.25 pH ) , which are restricted to place with snow accumulation and water runoff gully . In these ecosystem the greatest change occurred in the leaching of humus substance . Some formerly le abundant and rare soil animal restricted to acid bedrock became dominant in some ecosystem on limestone a well a on granite ; other formerly dominant specie disappeared from the entire study area ( e.g. , Folsomia alpina ) . The aerial extent of some ecosystem changed substantially since 1977 , and their surrounding ecotones moved into the space formerly occupied by one of the adjacent ecosystem . These change are detectable by remote-sensing method . In Central European mountain , strongly affected by global and regional industrial air pollution ( e.g. , Krusne Hory , Krkonose , Beskydy ) , spruce forest started to die back from higher to lower mountain elevation . The effect of air pollution on alpine and subalpine vegetation were not studied there . Strong alteration in alpine ecosystem and ecotones were detected by the author during long-term study in the High Tatra Mountains , and I suggest that subalpine and mountain forest belt will be affected here in the near future a they were in the more polluted Central European mountain . The ecosystem and ecotones in higher alpine zone are likely to be affected earlier than the ecosystem at lower altitude . Detection of ecosystem alteration in the alpine zone may be used for prediction of acidification process and global change in ecosystem at lower altitude . The consequence of global climate change are predictable by monitoring change in the extent of some ecosystem located in discrete mountain geomorphological unit ( e.g. , karstic sinkhole , water runoff gully , wind shadow , ridge exposed to wind , etc . ) and ecotones among them because of their dependence on duration of snow cover , water supply , wind and frost exposure , and other abiotic and biotic factor .

aVAn observational and modeling study of the microclimate of a suburban area , a related to the physical and biological nature of the site , is presented . The measurement and calculation are made in comparison with a nearby open agricultural location or ''control site '' . The measurement program wa conducted during the summer of 1981 in Davis , CA , and consisted of paired observation in which simultaneous measurement were made at a control site , located in a nearby rural area and one suburban site at a time . Results indicate that this methodology wa generally successful . The various suburban site were a often cooler than the rural site a they were warmer . In one case , a suburban site wa found to be substantially cooler , averaging 7.38-degrees-C over a 5 day period , than the rural site . This special case wa observed to be associated with unusually dry environmental air resulting in large evaporative cooling in the plant canopy . Comparison between the suburban temperature deficit and the physical nature of the various site reveals that canopy height explained most of the variance of this data set . Two generally important mechanism are hypothesized to be operating in this system : the effect of canopy size on turbulent mixing and on site shading , especially of paved area . A simple energy balance model wa applied to study the process that control the daytime suburban temperature deficit . In particular , it is found that suburban site can be a cool a observed when the following condition are obtained : low-canopy humidity , large canopy size , low wind speed and high radiation load . The model simulated the overall average suburban temperature deficit of all site for physically reasonable choice of model parameter . It is pointed out that the fact that suburban area may be cooler than surrounding rural area may have significance to the problem of assessing the role of the urban heat island in relation to possible global warming .

aVThe IEA Greenhouse Gas R & D Programme is conducting an initial 3-year study aimed at potential CO2 mitigation technique a a response to the issue of global warming . The Programme is currently examining , on a common basis , the option available for capturing and disposing of the CO2 produced from a range of fossil fuel fired power generation plant type , each with an output of 500MW ( e ) . The option available for disposing of large quantity of CO2 are reviewed and compared on the basis of current knowledge , and the global potential of the option estimated . Photosynthetic process , such a forestry and biomass production , which remove CO2 from the atmosphere are also included . The long term fate of the CO2 , in term of it eventual re-entry into the atmosphere , is discussed and the disposal option chosen for further study , under the IEA Greenhouse Gas R & D Programme , are identified .

aVIntensively managed microalgal production facility are capable of fixing several-fold more carbon dioxide per unit area than tree or crop . Although CO2 is still released when fuel derived from algal biomass are burned , integration of microalgal farm for flue gas capture approximately double the amount of energy produced per unit of CO2 released . Materials derived from microalgal biomass also can be used for other long-term us , serving to sequester CO2 . Flue gas ha the potential to provide sufficient quantity of CO2 for such large-scale microalgae farm . Viewing microalgae farm a a mean to reduce the effect of a greenhouse gas ( carbon dioxide , CO2 ) change the view of the economics of the process . Instead of requiring that microalgae-derived fuel be cost competitive with fossil fuel , the process economics must be compared with those of other technology proposed to deal with the problem of CO2 pollution . However , development of alternative , environmentally safer energy production technology will benefit society whether or not global climate change actually occurs . Microalgal biomass production ha great potential to contribute to world energy supply , and to control CO2 emission a the demand for energy increase . This technology make productive use of arid and semi-arid land and highly saline water , resource that are not suitable for agriculture and other biomass technology .

aVThe importance of the representation of cloud in a general circulation model is investigated by utilizing four different parameterization scheme for layer cloud in a low-resolution version of the general CirCulation model at the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research at the United Kingdom Meteorological Office . The performance of each version of the model in term of cloud and radiation is assessed in relation to satellite data from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment ( ERBE ) . Schemes that include a prognostic cloud water variable show some improvement on those with relative humidity-dependent cloud , but all still show marked difference from the ERBE data . The sensitivity of each of the version of the model to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 is investigated . Midlevel and lower-level cloud decrease when cloud is dependent on relative humidity , and this constitutes a strong positive feedback . When interactive cloud water is included , however , this effect is almost entirely compensated for by a negative feedback from the change of phase of cloud water from ice to water . Additional negative feedback are found when interactive radiative property of cloud are included and these lead to an overall negative cloud feedback . The global warming produced with the four model then range from 5.4-degrees with a relative humidity scheme to 1.9-degrees-C with interactive cloud water and radiative property . Improving the treatment of ice cloud based on observation increase the model 's sensitivity slightly to 2.1-degrees-C . Using an energy balance model , it is estimated that the climate sensitivity using the relative humidity scheme along with the negative feedback from cloud radiative property would be 2.8-degrees-C . Thus , 2.8-degrees-2.1-degrees-C appears to be a better estimate of the range of equilibrium response to a doubling of CO2 .

aVGlobal climate change associated with rising atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gas may alter regional temperature and precipitation pattern . Such change could threaten the availability of water resource for rapidly growing Third World city , many of which are already experiencing severe water supply deficiency . This paper investigates the potential impact of climate change on water resource availability for two Indian city , Bombay and Madras . The paper begin by discussing future trend for population growth and water demand in each city . Next , using climate change scenario based on three general circulation model ( GCMs ) , the paper ass how climate change may affect water availability in the two urban region . The assessment is conducted through the use of a monthly dryness index measuring potential evapotranspiration and precipitation . For each region , the dryness index under ''normal '' climatic condition is compared with index created using GCM scenario . The result of this assessment indicate that , unless large increase in regional precipitation accompany climate warming , higher rate of evapotranspiration will mean reduced water availability for both city . The paper concludes by discussing some implication for water management in Third World city .

aVInternational policy measure to deal with the enhanced greenhouse effect am being debated on a scientific basis which is still uncertain . The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) ha produced a major scientific assessment of climatic change . They concluded that , despite uncertainty , the model simulation of a warming due to increased concentration of greenhouse gas am broadly consistent with observation of global temperature change . Carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas from human activity . Increases in CO2 concentration in the atmosphere contribute over half of the enhanced greenhouse effect , the rest being mainly due to increase in halocarbon and methane . The total effect of greenhouse gas emission depends on their lifetime in the atmosphere . The global warming potential of other greenhouse gas is expressed relative to that of CO2 . However , the lifetime Of CO2 in the atmosphere is complicated by uptake into the many carbon storage sink of the global carbon cycle . Knowledge of the global carbon cycle is incomplete , the source exceeding the sum of known sink . Reductions in the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere could be achieved by reducing the emission or enlarging the sink . What is achieved in future will depend to a large extent on a mom detailed understanding of carbon storage mechanism .

aVThere is a variety of technique for comparing the environmental impact of electricity from different source . Only monetary valuation of the impact offer the prospect of providing comparison on a single baseline . Unfortunately , practical and methodological problem generally prevent accurate valuation . For fossil fuel electricity generation the major environmental externality result from acid deposition , tropospheric ozone and global warming . For nuclear power the main issue are major reactor accident and long-term waste disposal . Some broad estimate of environmental externality ( in p/kWh ) are given from each , based on available scientific evidence and valuation study . The uncertainty and methodological problem associated with valuation prevent any reliable statement about the relative magnitude of externality resulting from fossil and nuclear generating option . In both case , some of the impact are incompatible with stricter interpretation of sustainability . The important environmental impact of most renewable electricity generating option concern human amenity . With some exception , where area of more than local significance for ecology or recreation are concerned , the monetary value of the impact will be small . For most electricity conservation technology , the externality are negligible . Energy conservation and renewable electricity supply will therefore form key component of a sustainable energy system .

aVA statistical strategy to deduct regional-scale feature from climate general circulation model ( GCM ) simulation ha been designed and tested . The main idea is to interrelate the characteristic pattern of observed simultaneous variation of regional climate parameter and of large-scale atmospheric flow using the canonical correlation technique . The large-scale North Atlantic sea level pressure ( SLP ) is related to the regional , variable , winter ( DJF ) mean Iberian Peninsula rainfall . The skill of the resulting statistical model is shown by reproducing , to a good approximation , the winter mean Iberian rainfall from 1900 to present from the observed North Atlantic mean SLP distribution . It is shown that this observed relationship between these two variable is not well reproduced in the output of a general circulation model ( GCM ) . The implication for Iberian rainfall change a the response to increasing atmospheric greenhouse-gas concentration simulated by two GCM experiment are examined with the proposed statistical model . In an instantaneous '' 2 CO2 '' doubling experiment , using the simulated change of the mean North Atlantic SLP field to predict Iberian rainfall yield , there is an insignificant increase of area-averaged rainfall of 1 mm/month , with maximum value of 4 mm/month in the northwest of the peninsula . In contrast , for the four GCM grid point representing the Iberian Peninsula , the change is - 10 mm/ month , with a minimum of - 19 mm/ month in the southwest . In the second experiment , with the IPCC scenario A ( ''business a usual '' ) increase of CO2 , the statistical-model result partially differ from the directly simulated rainfall change : in the experimental range of 100 year , the area-averaged rainfall decrease by 7 mm/month ( statistical model ) , and by 9 mm/month ( GCM ) ; at the same time the amplitude of the interdecadal variability is quite different .

aVCyclone wave directly affect the density , structure and local distribution of coral assemblage by acting a agent of mortality and colony transport . Using the meteorological record , hydrodynamic formulation and risk analysis , we predict some demographic consequence of cyclone for massive coral growing in different region of the Great Barrier Reef . Analysis of shear , compression and tension force generated by wave indicate that coral firmly attached to solid substratum , even if only over a small proportion of their base , can resist all wave , regardless of colony size or shape , cyclone intensity or region . Waves are thus directly important a control on colony-size frequency distribution only for weakly attached or unattached colony . At 3 m depth , these colony have a higher probability of escaping dislodgement in their first 10 year of life , the further north or south they are from 21-degrees-S , which is the latitude where severe cyclone are most frequent . At 21-degrees S , coral at depth a great a 12 m are exposed to the greatest likelihood of dislodgement . Possible implication of predicted increased storminess associated with global warming are briefly discussed .

aVThis paper discus the possible environmental and economic implication of small-scale combined heat and power ( CHP ) in the UK . The technology is based on internal combustion engine running on natural gas . Electricity is generated with high efficiency from a fuel that ha the lowest carbon to energy content of the fossil fuel . Furthermore , this form of CHP ha the potential to be applied very widely . Viable installation could range from 40 kW ( e ) in small commercial building to over 50 MW ( e ) on large industrial site . Small-scale CHP therefore offer great scope for reducing emission of CO2 , a major contributor to global warming .

aVThe environmental impact of nuclear power generation are considered for the whole fuel cycle , from the mining of uranium to provide fuel for nuclear reactor right through to the disposal of radioactive waste and the decommissioning of power station . This is done for existing reactor type and possible future development . The radiological impact of routine low level discharge of activity into the environment is small compared with that from natural background radioactivity , while risk to operator arising from exposure to ionising radiation are comparable with those experienced in other safe industry . The quantity of waste produced by the nuclear industry are modest compared with many other industry , and the disposal of most of it is a routine operation ; the decommissioning of nuclear power station at the end of their useful life can be seen a a large waste management exercise . The potential for an accident in the UK , on the scale of the Chernobyl incident , is remote . Overall , nuclear power is well controlled and can be seen to have environmental benefit compared with other form of power generation . Its many advantage include the reduction in greenhouse gas which contribute to global warming and other atmospheric pollutant which contribute to acid rain . Nuclear power add desirable diversity to electricity supply , increasing the reliability of meeting energy need .

aVPopulations of animal and plant often undergo conspicuous ecological change when subjected to climatic extreme . Evolutionary change may accompany them but are le easily detected . We show that Darwin 's finch on a Galapagos island underwent two evolutionary change after a severe El Nino event caused change in their food supply . Small beak size were selectively favoured in one granivorous specie when large seed became scarce . The effect of selection were transmitted to the next generation a a result of high trait heritabilities . Hybridization between this specie and two others resulted in gene exchange , but only after the El Nino when hybrid fitness wa much enhanced under the altered feeding condition . These observation imply that if global warming increase the frequency or severity of El Nino event on the Galapagos , microevolutionary change in animal and plant population are to be anticipated .

aVTop-down and bottom-up modelling technique have been used to answer the question of how much would it cost to reduce greenhouse gas emission . These two type of model , however , were conceived and designed through different discipline , for different purpose and lead to very different conclusion . Recent attempt to compare the two modelling approach illustrate the difficulty in reconciling their result . In this paper , both modelling technique are described and discussed , and the gap between their result is explored .

aVBoreal forest of Russia play a prominent role in the global carbon cycle and the flux of greenhouse gas to the atmosphere . Large area of Russian forest burn annually , and contribution to the net flux of carbon to the atmosphere may be significant . Forest fire emission were calculated for the year 1971-1991 using fire frequency and distribution data and fuel and carbon density for different forest ecoregions of Russia . Both direct carbon release and indirect post-fire biogenic carbon flux were estimated . From 1971 to 1991 the annual total forest area burned by wildfire ranged from 1.41 X 10 ( 6 ) to 10.0 X 10 ( 6 ) ha . Approximately 15 000 - 25 000 forest fire occurred annually during this period . Mean annual direct CO2-C emission from wildfire wa approximately 0.05 Pg over this 21 -year period . Total post-fire biogenic CO2-C emission for 1971-1991 ranged from 2.5 to 5.9 Pg ( 0.12-0.28 Pg annually ) . Forest fire and other disturbance are expected to be a primary mechanism driving vegetation change associated with projected global climate change . Future forest fire scenario in Russia based on general circulation model projection suggest that up to 30-50 % of the land surface area , or 334 x 10 ( 6 ) to 631 x 10 ( 6 ) ha of forest , will be affected . An additional 6.7 x 10 ( 6 ) to 12.6 x 10 ( 6 ) ha of Russian boreal forest are projected to burn annually if general circulation model based vegetation-change scenario are achieved within the next 50 year . The direct flux Of CO2-C from future forest fire is estimated to total 6.1-10.7 Pg over a 50-year period . Indirect post-fire biogenic release of greenhouse gas in the future is expected to be two to six time greater than direct emission . Forest management and fire-control activity may help reduce wildfire severity and mitigate the associated pulse of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere .

aVA process-based model wa used to estimate global pattern of net primary production and soil nitrogen cycling for contemporary climate condition and current atmospheric CO2 concentration . Over half of the global annual net primary production wa estimated to occur in the tropic , with most of the production attributable to tropical evergreen forest . The effect of CO2 doubling and associated climate change were also explored . The response in tropical and dry temperate ecosystem were dominated by CO2 , but those in northern and moist temperate ecosystem reflected the effect of temperature on nitrogen availability .

aVWhat should U.S. agriculture do to adapt for possible climate change and what can it do to reduce greenhouse gas emission ? An evaluation indicates that , unless there is a decline of about one-fourth in total crop yield , the U.S. land resource base will be adequate and food security can be met . The impact of climate change on individual crop production region are hard to predict , however , and may be either negative or positive . The assumption must be made that agriculture face an uncertain future and , therefore , must rely upon experience , adoption of proven technology , development of new technology , and improved husbandry of land , water , and energy resource . Carbon dioxide , one of the greenhouse gas , can be emitted , a well a sequestered , in large amount by agriculture . Agriculture ha a great opportunity to help mitigate climate change by stashing CO2 a C in soil and vegetation and by displacing fossil fuel . Practices requiring good agricultural husbandry , which should be implemented anyway , can be quite effective for sequestering C. For cropland , these practice include building soil organic matter level , improving soil fertility , and growing more food on le land . Carbon pool are maintained , restored , and enlarged on croplands by increased use of conservation tillage , improved use of animal and other waste , minimized dryland fallowing , and preservation of marginal land . On forestlands , reforestation , forestation ( including tree planting on conservation reserve program land ) , and improved forest harvesting practice maintain and enlarge C-pools . Preservation of wetland doe much to maintain C-pools . Collectively , these practice can potentially offset not only the CO2 emission from U.S. agriculture , but also part of that from U.S. source outside of agriculture .

aVA modified Budyko global vegetation model is used to predict change in global vegetation pattern resulting from climate change ( CO2 doubling ) . Vegetation pattern are predicted using a model based on a dryness index and potential evaporation determined by solving radiation balance equation . Climate change scenario are derived from prediction from four General Circulation Models ( GCM 's ) of the atmosphere ( GFDL , GISS , OSU , and UKMO ) . Global vegetation map after climate change are compared to the current climate vegetation map using the kappa statistic for judging agreement , a well a by calculating area statistic . All four GCM scenario show similar trend in vegetation shift and in area that remain stable , although the UKMO scenario predicts greater warming than the others . Climate change map produced by all four GCM scenario show good agreement with the current climate vegetation map for the globe a a whole , although over half of the vegetation class show only poor to fair agreement . The most stable area are Desert and Ice/Polar Desert . Because most of the predicted warming is concentrated in the Boreal and Temperate zone , vegetation there is predicted to undergo the greatest change . Specifically , all Boreal vegetation class are predicted to shrink . The interrelated class of Tundra , Taiga , and Temperate Forest are predicted to replace much of their poleward mostly northern ) neighbor . Most vegetation class in the Subtropics and Tropics are predicted to expand . Any shift in the Tropics favoring either Forest over Savanna , or vice versa , will be determined by the magnitude of the increased precipitation accompanying global warming . Although the model predicts equilibrium condition to which many plant specie can not adjust ( through migration or microevolution ) in the 50-100 y needed for CO2 doubling , it is nevertheless not clear if projected global warming will result in drastic or benign vegetation change .

aVThe looming possibility of global warming raise legitimate concern for the future of the forest resource in Canada . While evidence of a global warming trend is not conclusive at this time , government would be wise to anticipate , and begin planning for , such an eventuality . The forest fire business is likely to be affected both early and dramatically by any trend toward warmer and drier condition in Canada , and fire manager should be aware that the future will likely require new and innovative thinking in forest fire management . This paper summarizes research activity currently underway to ass the impact of global warming on forest fire . and speculates on future fire management problem and strategy .

aVIn the last few decade , the international insurance industry ha been confronted with a drastic increase in the scope and frequency of great natural disaster . The trend is primarily attributable to the continuing steady growth of the world population and the increasing concentration of people and economic value in urban area . An additional factor is the global migration of population and industry into area such a coastal region , which are particularly exposed to natural hazard . The natural hazard themselves , on the other hand , have not yet shown any significant increase . In addition to the problem the insurance industry ha with regard to pricing , capacity and loss reserve , the assessment of insured liability , preventive planning and the proper adjustment of catastrophe loss are gaining importance . The present problem will be dramatically aggravated if the greenhouse prediction come true . The increased intensity of all convective process in the atmosphere will force up the frequency and severity of tropical cyclone , tornado , hailstorm , flood and storm surge in many part of the world with serious consequence for all type of property insurance . Rates will have to be raised and in certain coastal area insurance cover will only be available after considerable restriction have been imposed , a for example significant deductible and low liability or loss limit . In area of high insurance density the loss potential of individual catastrophe can reach a level at which the national and international insurance industry will run into serious capacity problem . Recent disaster showed the disproportionately high participation of reinsurers in extreme disaster loss and the need for more risk transparency if the insurance industry is to fulfil it obligation in an increasingly hostile environment .

aVThis paper examines to what extent the European Community is progressing towards realizing it objective of integrating energy and environment policy by looking at two current policy development ; the CO2 reduction strategy and the internal energy market ( IEM ) initiative . It argues that to date adjustment to energy policy have been made essentially at the margin , resulting in a number of policy tension . The IEM proposal are based on a very narrow definition of efficiency and fail to address crucial area like the promotion of renewable energy source or end-use efficiency . Not all the implication are negative but incidental benefit hardly point to better integration .

aVConcern about global warming , poor urban air quality and dependence on insecure source of oil are leading many nation to examine alternative energy source and technology for transportation and electricity generation . This analysis show that most of the near-term fossil fuel-based alternative would not dramatically reduce emission of greenhouse gas . However , in the long run , several ultra-low-emission fuel and technology are available . The major uncertainty in the analysis are the efficiency of energy use , the warming potential of greenhouse gas other than CO2 and the economic and political context in which energy is used .

aVOcean temperature in the upper 250 m in the northern North Pacific ( 60-degrees-N , 149-degrees-W ) increased bt more than 1-degrees-C from 1972 to 1098 but are now decreasing . Subsurface temperature anomaly are well correlated ( approximately 0.58 ) with the air temperature anomaly at Sitka , Alaska ; hence the coastal air temperature can be used a a proxy data set to extend the ocean temperature time series back to 1828 . Up to 30 % of the low-frequency variance can be accounted for with the 18.6-year nodal signal . Additionally . spectral analysis of these air temperature variation indicates a significant low-frequency peak in the range of the 18.6-year signal . Similar low-frequency signal have been reported for Hudson Bay air temperature since 1700 , for sea surface temperature in the North Atlantic from 1876 to 1939 , and for sea level in the high-latitude southern hemisphere . The water column temperature variation presented here are the first evidence that the upper ocean is responding to this very long period tidal forcing . An enhanced high-latitude response to the 18.6-year forcing is predicted by equilibrium tide theory , and it should be most evident at latitude poleward of about 50-degrees . These low-frequency ocean-atmosphere variation must - be considered in high-latitude assessment of global climate change , since they are of the same magnitude a many of the predicted global change .

aVIn the southwestern New Jersey Coastal Plain , four drill hole contain continuous neritic sedimentation across the Paleocene/Eocene boundary ( calcareous nannofossil Zone NP 9/NP 10 boundary ) . Significant lithologic and biotic change occur in these stratum near the top of the Paleocene . Global warming , increased precipitation , and other oceanographic and climatic event that have been recognized in high-latitude , deep-oceanic deposit of the latest Paleocene also influenced mid-latitude , shallow-marine , and terrestrial environment of the western North Atlantic . The diverse , well-preserved calcareous nannofossil flora that is present throughout the entire New Jersey boundary section accurately place these event within the uppermost part of the upper Paleocene Zone NP 9 . Several rapid but gradational change occur within a 1.1-m interval near the top of Zone NP 9 . The change include ( 1 ) a change in lithology from glauconitic quartz sand to clay , ( 2 ) a change in clay mineral suite from illite/smectite-dominated to kaolinite-dominated , ( 3 ) a change in benthic foraminiferal assemblage to a lower diversity fauna suggestive of low-oxygen environment , ( 4 ) a significant increase in planktonic foraminiferal abundance , and ( 5 ) an increased specie turnover rate in marine calcareous nannofossils . Pollen wa sparse in the New Jersey drill hole , but terrestrial sporomorph specie in Virginia exhibit increased turnover rate at a correlative level . Foraminiferal assemblage and lithology indicate that relative sea level rose in New Jersey at the same time a these late Paleocene event occurred in late Biochron NP 9 . The higher sea level influenced sediment type and absolute abundance of planktonic foraminifer in the deposit . Above the initial increase of kaolinite in the upper part of Zone NP 9 , the kaolinite percentage continues to increase , and the maximum kaolinite value occurs in the uppermost part of Zone NP 9 . There are few change in either the sediment or the biota precisely at the Zone NP 9/NP 10 boundary in New Jersey . The clay-rich deposit with a high kaolinite clay mineral suite , the lowered diversity benthic foraminiferal assemblage , the abundant planktonic foraminiferal specimen , and the calcareous nannofossil assemblage continued essentially unchanged into the earliest Eocene Zone NP 10 . Within the lower part of Zone NP 10 , the kaolinite percentage decreased to very low value .

aVAs a fall-back response to the possibility of Global Warming due lo increasing gas in the atmosphere British Coal is investigating Low-CO2 Power Generation option . One of the most promising option is an Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle ( IGCC ) system using a membrane separation unit to separate H-2 and CO2 . However , the performance requirement can not be met by currently available commercial membrane . A small-scale membrane permeation test rig ha been designed and built at CRE . This paper describes screening test carried out on polymeric and Pd/Ag alloy membrane . The most promising of these wa the Pd/Ag alloy a it did not pas any CO2 . Microporous ceramic and thin film of Pd/Ag deposited onto a suitable porous substrate will be tested in the near future .

aVA mathematical model of terrestrial biomass biogasification is presented . This model calculates mass and energy balance and the levelized cost of synthetic natural gas ( SNG ) . It consists of interconnected module for harvesting , biomass transportation , biogasification , gas processing , energy balance , global climate change , and economics . The conversion module incorporates bioconversion technology recently developed at pilot scale at Cornell University and Walt Disney World . In large-scale biomass biogasification , in any climate at any reactor temperature , process heat need are small and could be reduced to zero if metabolic heat production is included . Therefore , thermophilic digestion should be preferred to mesophilic , to the extent that the former result in higher reaction rate . Preliminary sensitivity analysis were conducted . Economies of scale are described . Increases in biomass productivity yield diminishing return above 45-55 Mg/ha year ( 20-25 dry tons/ac ) . Distribution of field around the conversion facility is unimportant a long a at least thirty percent of the surrounding area is planted in energy crop . Improvements in methane yield result in continuing return , confirming the importance of this parameter . Only a minor penalty is incurred for overdesigning the retention time up to fifty percent ; such overdesign would greatly enhance reliability . The research state-of-the-art is slightly above $ 6/GJ ( MMBtu ) . Sale of coproducts could reduce this cost in half . The potential impact of energy crop on global climate change is quantified .

aVThis paper discus the multicriteria capacity-mix problem of electric utility . Traditional least-cost generation-expansion planning ha become inadequate due to the prevailing multiple , conflicting objective such a cost , environmental degradation , and nuclear hazard . This particularly true with emerging concern over carbon dioxide emission that are believed to contribute to global warming . In this paper we present the preference-order dynamic programming approach , so that this new logic can be implemented with the already available dynamic-programming-based capacity-expansion planning tool , called Wien Automatic System Planning Package ( WASP ) . Through our case study , we note the importance of considering global warming a well a nuclear hazard . We also note that substituting plant that use cleaner fuel such a natural gas for those that use carbon-intensive fuel such a coal is more effective in controlling carbon dioxide emission . This substitution method is also more effective than replacing these plant with carbon dioxide-free nuclear unit .

aVThe vertical distribution and fine scale structure of nitrate ( NO3 ) , nitrite ( NO2 ) , nitrous oxide ( N2O ) , phosphate ( PO4 ) , oxygen ( 02 ) and chlorophyll a ( chl a ) were determined in the North Western Indian Ocean ( NWIO ) along a meridional section ( 67-degrees-E ) from the Equator to the Gulf of Oman using an Autoanalyser for micromolar level of nutrient , and chemiluminescence and gas chromatographic method for nanomolar level of NO3 and NO2 and N2O respectively . Three biogeochemically contrasting regime were investigated : ( 1 ) the highly oligotrophic nutrient-depleted subtropical gyre ; ( 2 ) the monsoonal upwelling of nutrient-rich intermediate water off the southeastern Arabian Coast ; and ( 3 ) the denitrifying 02-depleted zone ( ODZ ; ca 150-1200 m depth ) in the Arabian Sea . Concentrations of NO3 and NO2 were severely depleted in surface oligotrophic water from the equator ( average 43 and 3.6 nM respectively ) to the subtropical gyre ( 12-15-degrees-N ; average 13.3 and 2.0 nM respectively ) with similar level in the more stratified Gulf of Oman . Upwelling water off Southern Arabia had three order of magnitude higher NO3 level , and throughout the NWIO , the calculated NO3-fuelled primary production appeared to be regulated by NO3 concentration . Existing Redfield DELTAO2/DELTANO3 regeneration ratio ( =9 . 1 ) previously derived for the deep Indian Ocean were confirmed ( =9.35 ) within the oxic upper layer of the NWIO . The ''NO '' -potential temperature relationship ( BROECKER , 1974 , Earth and Planetary Science Letters , 23 , 100-107 ) needed for the derivation of expected NO3 and NO3-deficits within the denitrifying ODZ were refined using an isopycnal , binary mixing model along the sigma ( theta ) = 26.6 % . density layer to take into account the inflowing contribution of NO3-depleted Persian Gulf Water . Vertically integrated NO3-deficits increased northward from 0.8 mol NO3-N m-2 at Sta . 2 ( 04-degrees-N ) , up to 6.49 mol NO3-N m-2 at Sta . 9 , at the mouth of the Gulf of Oman , then decreased to 4 . 10 mole NO3 -N m-2 toward Sta . 11 , near the Straits of Hormuz . When averaged for the denitrification area of the Arabian Sea , this corresponds to a deficit of 118 Tg NO3-N . Adopting a recent Freon-11 based estimate of water residence time of 10 year ( OLSON et al. , 1993 , Deep-Sea Research II , 40 , 673-685 ) for the O2-depleted layer , we calculate an annual net denitrification flux of 11.9 Tg N to the atmosphere or approximately 10 % of the global water column denitrification rate . Supersaturated N2O concentration were found in both surface oxic and upwelling water ( up to 246 % ) and peaked at the base of the ODZ ( up to 1264 % ) in the northern Arabian Sea . Both nitrification in oxic water and denitrification in hypoxic layer can be invoked a source of N2O . The inventory of excess N2O amounted to 2.55 +/- 1.3 Tg N2O-N , corresponding to annual production of 0.26 +/- 0.13 Tg from denitrification . This is comparable to earlier ( LAW and OWENS , 1990 , Nature , 346 , 826-828 ) estimate of the ventilation flux of N2O ( 0.22-0.39 Tg yr-1 ) from the upwelling region of the Arabian Sea . The decadal response time for circulation , deoxygenation , denitrification and ventilation of the ODZ-derived N2O and CO2 greenhouse gas and their monsoonal coupling implies the Arabian Sea is a sensitive oceanic recorder of global climate change .

aVFinite computer resource force compromise in the design of transient numerical experiment with coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model which , in the case of global warming simulation , normally preclude a full integration from the undisturbed pre-industrial state . The start of the integration at a later time from a climate state which , in contrast to the true climate , is initially in equilibrium then induces a cold start error . Using linear response theory a general expression for the cold start error is derived . The theory is applied to the Hamburg CO2 scenario simulation . An attempt to estimate the global-mean-temperature response function of the coupled model from the response of the model to a CO2 doubling wa unsuccessful because of the non-linearity of the system . However , an alternative derivation , based on the transient simulation itself , yielded a cold start error which explained the initial retardation of the Hamburg global warming curve relative to the IPCC result obtained with a simple box-diffusion-upwelling model . In the case of the sea level the behaviour of the model is apparently more linear . The cold start error estimation based on a CO2 doubling experiment and on an experiment with gradually increasing CO2 ( scenario A ) are very similar and explain about two third of the coupled model retardation relative to the IPCC result .

aVThe geologic record show unequivocally that the present world is unusually cold ; the so called 'greenhouse ' condition ha been normal for planet Earth for the past 500 million year . Continental position , orbital parameter , and atmospheric composition strongly influence global climate on timescales ranging from 10 ( 8 ) to 10 ( 2 ) year . Atmospheric CO2 is an important contributing factor in determining average global temperature , and is particularly important in influencing change over shorter timescales ( say 10 ( 5 ) year ) . Terrestrial carbon sequestering is strongly influenced by the biology of the organism involved and it ha been shown that terrestrial carbon sequestering is greater in ever-wet condition . The distribution of the site of greatest carbon sequestering switch from low latitude during icehouse time to higher latitude , > 40-degrees , during greenhouse time , except maritime site . Evolutionary factor , e.g . competition , and climate change have led to major ecosystem restructuring during the past 500 million year . Pre-change biodiversity is therefore critical in determining the nature and rate of restructuring particularly with respect to plant which are the only group of organism capable of carbon sequestering . There exists a number of uncertainty a well a probability involved in estimating sequestering ratio and climate change ; Estimates of past carbon sequestering are likely to be too low because dispersed fossil organic matter is inadequately inventoried . Numerical climate model result are unreliable unless evaluated against fossil and sediment data . Terrestrial carbon sequestering is unlikely to dominate tectonic control but a it operates on a shorter time scale it ha a strong short term effect and could well tip the climate balance in critical situation . Most extant land plant have a C3 photosynthetic pathway . However , under condition where photorespiration can reduce photosynthetic efficiency , warmth and high O2 concentration , many unrelated plant have independently evolved C4 pathway . C4 plant have different water relation and competitive characteristic to C3 plant and clearly ecosystem structure and carbon sequestering are likely to change with global warming . By studying the different isotopic signature bequeathed by these system the fossil record can provide critical data on the dynamic of plant with these system under changing climatic condition : data that again are essential for effective ecosystem management strategy .

aVThe road transportation system ( including automobile , bus and truck ) ha not yet made significant use of modern electronics technology to enhance system operation . Intelligent vehicle/highway system ( IVHS ) is the label currently applied to the nascent attempt to use advanced technology to enable traveler , vehicle and the roadway infrastructure to function a an integrated system . IVHS technology influence both the supply and demand side of transportation , to promote enhanced operational efficiency and reduction in vehicle mile traveled . These change can reduce the contribution of the transportation sector to global warming in way that are explained qualitatively in the paper . Quantitative evaluation of the global-warming implication of IVHS must follow from further research on the technology and traveler ' response to it , and from development of the policy framework for IVHS implementation .

aVWe assessed the potential effect of a greenhouse gas-induced global climate change on the hydrology and vegetation of a semi-permanent prairie wetland using a spatially-defined , rule-based simulation model . An 11-yr simulation wa run using current versus enhanced greenhouse gas climate . Projections of climatic change were from the Goddard Institute for Space Studies ( GISS ) general circulation model . Simulations were also run using a range of temperature ( +2 and +4-degrees-C ) and precipitation change value ( -20 , -10 , 0 , +10 , +20 % ) to determine the responsiveness of wetland vegetation and hydrology to a variety of climate scenario . Maximum water depth were significantly le under the enhanced greenhouse gas scenario than under the current climate . The wetland dried in most year with increased temperature and change in precipitation . Simulations also revealed a significant change in the vegetation , from a nearly balanced emergent cover to open water ratio to a completely closed basin with no open water area . Simulations over a range of climate change scenario showed that precipitation change ( particularly increase ) had a greater impact on water level and cover ratio when the temperature increase wa moderate ( +2-degrees-C ) . These potential change in wetland hydrology and vegetation could result in a dramatic decline in the quality of habitat for breeding bird , particularly water-fowl . Continued research on climate and wetland modeling is needed .

aVThe effect of climate change by the increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide on terrestrial ecosystem ha attracted much attention . For estimating these effect quantitatively , model that express the global carbon cycle is needed . We constructed model a express vegetation growth and carbon cycle in soil . In this report , by using these two model , we estimated the carbon cycle between terrestrial ecosystem and the atmosphere and predicted the effect on the global carbon cycle . By this model we can predict that terrestrial ecosystem emit carbon dioxide to the atmosphere with increase of temperature .

aVAn analysis ha been carried out of the prospect of using lesser known rainforest tree a new crop , mainly for high quality cabinetwood production . The economic return of 43 rainforest tree were assessed using expert opinion and the Delphi method to provide an evaluation and ranking of the most valuable specie . Cuban mahogany ( Swietenia mahogeni ) , American mahogany ( Swietenia macrophylla ) , West Indian cedar ( Cedrela odorata ) , teak ( Tectona grandis ) , and hoop pine ( Araucaria cunninghamii ) were identified by a simple model a the most valuable tree specie . Sensitivity analysis were carried out on the effect of both increased long term timber price and change in tree productivity on financial return . Further research on plantation development and an extensive literature review of the top ten specie is also needed . Global warming scenario indicate that the relative viability of plantation of tropical rainforest specie in northern Australia will improve a a result of smaller temperature increase and higher rainfall than in southern Australia . Conditions are now more economically favourable for commercial tree planting than in the past and could lead to the future involvement of financial organization and the payment of annuity to owner of tree farm . An ultimate aim is the development of market in tree farm or plantation similar to those in agricultural enterprizes generally .

aVIt ha been proposed to cool building in downtown Toronto using cold , deep water withdrawn from Lake Ontario . 50 m3 s-1 of sub-thermocline water would be withdrawn from a depth of 80 m at a temperature close to 4-degrees-C , distributed to chiller throughout the city , and discharged on the surface in the nearshore zone at a temperature of 12-degrees-C Compared with electrically-powered chiller , the Deep Lake Water Cooling ( DLWC ) scheme is thermodynamically elegant and environmentally beneficial in many way . Using a one-dimensional thermodynamic model of Lake Ontario , this paper ass the physical impact of the DLWC scheme on the whole lake under present and future condition . We conclude that the lake could presently absorb the heat from the proposed Toronto installation and 20 others like it without major lake-wide physical change . At a conservative estimate of 1000 m3 s-1 with an 8-degrees-C temperature differential , the DLWC scheme would reject approximately 33.5 GW of ''waste heat '' to Lake Ontario . Under our best estimate of a 2 x CO2 climate scenario , the deep water could be 2-3-degrees-C warmer than they are now . The DLWC system would be le efficient , but the lake would retain a similar overall cooling capacity . Neither biological consequence nor the local physical impact of the discharge of heated subsurface water from the DLWC system are addressed in this study .

aVThe research reported herein focused on the general hypothesis that satellite remote sensing of large-area , long-term trend in lake ice phenology ( formation and breakup ) is a robust , integrated measure of regional and global climate change . To validate this hypothesis , we explored the use of data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer ( AVHRR ) to discriminate the presence and extent of lake ice during the winter of 1990-1991 on the 45 lake and reservoir in Wisconsin with a surface area greater than 1,000 hectare . Our result suggest both the feasibility of using the AVHRR to determine the date of lake ice breakup a well a the strong correlation ( R = -0.87 ) of the date so derived with local surface-based temperature measurement . These result suggest the potential of using current and archival satellite data to monitor change in the date of lake ice breakup a a mean of detecting regional ''signals '' of greenhouse warming .

aVGlobal warming is one of the serious global environmental problem and it major reason is considered cd to be the increase of atmospheric CO2 concentration . In order that more precise and rational prediction of global warming and other climatic phenomenon become possible by numerical simulation , the establishment of global material cycle model is essential particularly for carbon . As the first step in constructing this carbon cycle model , a simplified dynamic model describing the carbon exchange between the atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystem wa developed . The carbon storage in biomass and the net primary production of various vegetation in steady state and their transitional change in non-steady state derived by the model calculation were in good agreement with those previously reported in the literature . The net ecosystem production wa also estimated for five type of vegetation during a long growth period . Though further improvement of the model are still needed , we can conclude at this stage that the basic framework of the carbon cycle model on the terrestrial ecosystem which may play a role a one of the sub-models of a global carbon cycle model wa established .

aVThis paper analysis the structure of the energy and economic model represented in the recently completed Energy Modeling Forum ( EMF ) study , EMF 12 : Economic Impacts of Policies to Reduce Energy-Sector Carbon Dioxide Emissions . The 14 model in the study are heterogeneous , which ha a number of advantage . Chief among these is the greater number of insight obtainable by comparing the model ' result in and across ' global warming policy scenario . To fully appreciate the result , however , it is necessary to understand how a model 's structure affect it output . The disadvantage of a diverse set of model is that it complicates structure comparison , and thereby the interpretation of result . The relevant model characteristic fall into three broad area of comparison . The first is the model type , including market representation . Despite the many difference among the model , five distinct class of market representation are seen within which model have great similarity . This simplifies understanding the remaining area of comparison : energy demand and supply modelling . The focus here are the representation of capital stock dynamic and market penetration of carbon free energy source respectively .

aVResults from a 2-year study of wet coastal tundra ecosystem located near Prudhoe Bay , Alaska indicate that CH4 flux to the atmosphere is strongly controlled by soil moisture content and the depth of the seasonally thawed soil active layer . Daily CH4 flux from a flooded and well drained site on the Prudhoe Bay oil field wa on average 0.7 and 0.1 gC m-2 day-1 , respectively over both sampling season . Daily CH4 flux in an area located approximately 50 km south of Prudhoe Bay wa considerably higher . This area ( APL 133-3 ) contained a flooded , moist , and dry site which emitted on average 1 . 5 , 1 . 1 , and 0.2 gC m-2 day-1 to the atmosphere , respectively over both sampling season . These flux rate represent significant input of CH4 to the atmosphere . Evidence of the importance of soil moisture and thaw depth in controlling CH4 flux , coupled with the predominantly waterlogged , anaerobic condition of wet tundra soil , suggest the potential for strong interaction of this soil-atmosphere system with global climate change .

aVSurficial sediment at Esperance , on the southern coast of Western Australia , are predominantly bioclastic carbonate in which test of foraminifera are a major constituent . The megascopic specie Marginopora vertebralis is prolific , occupying relatively protected area of algal turf and seagrass . The abundance of this normally tropical foraminifer at southern latitude can be attributed to the Leeuwin Current , which brings warm water from the tropic to southwestern Australia , and then eastward , past Esperance into the Great Australian Bight . The Leeuwin Current is significantly warmer than the cool interfacing water of the Southern Ocean that otherwise characterise the southern Australian continental shelf . Last interglacial sediment of the Glanville Formation , in northern Spencer Gulf of South Australia , host an assemblage of fossil foraminifera which is similar to that of the modern environment at Esperance , especially the presence of M. vertebralis . Two bivalve mollusc , Anadara trapezium and Pinctada carchariarium , both characteristic of warm water , are also present in the Glanville Formation . Marginopora vertebralis and other faunal element migrated to South Australia by mean of the last interglacial equivalent of the Leeuwin Current , which apparently had greater definition at that time . It may therefore be inferred that , during other time of global warming and corresponding higher sea level , the palaeo-Leeuwin current had greater ecological influence across the continental shelf of Southern Australia . Thus , warm-water marine fossil in the Glanville Formation do not necessarily signify last interglacial water temperature for the open Southern Ocean , beyond the continental shelf . Similarly , it can not be assumed that these fossil necessarily indicate a last interglacial climate for terrestrial southern Australian that wa warmer than presently prevails .

aVIndustrial society consume vast quantity of fossil fuel resource , the carbon dioxide released when these fuel are combusted is a major concern because of global warming . ''Energy Return On Investment '' ( EROI ) is the ratio of energy gain from a resource relative to the energy invested to achieve that gain . EROI analysis show that the net energy available from fossil fuel decrease a resource are depleted , encouraging a transition to renewable resource which will not be depleted under sustainable management . Renewable resource can reduce net contribution of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere ; however , many source of renewable energy require fossil fuel input into their production process . EROI analysis can also be used to determine renewable energy source with the greatest energy gain , relative to the fossil fuel investment required to achieve that gain . One renewable source of energy with considerable potential for expansion in Canada is wood biomass . A case study of whole tree chipping ( WTC ) in Prince Edward Island revealed an EROI ratio of wood chip energy gained relative to fuel energy invested of 26.7:1 . The major factor affecting the EROI for WTC wa transport of the chip to the burning facility : distance and load size were important component that should be considered when designing new burning facility . There are some benefit and disadvantage of WTC not captured by EROI analysis that also need to be considered .

aVConsiderable attention ha been paid in recent year to photo chemical smog pollution close to the earth 's surface and to stratospheric ozone depletion . There is reason to suspect that the next round of scientific concern will be devoted to the perturbation in the ''free troposphere . '' Tropospheric ozone ha been building up in many region of the northern hemisphere . Ozone change in the upper troposphere will exert a considerable impact on global warming . This could affect moisture level , cloud amount and distribution , precipitation , and atmospheric dynamic on different scale . This paper analyzes : ( 1 ) the physical and chemical process contributing to change in tropospheric ozone concentration ; ( 2 ) the observational evidence of previous ozone change ; and ( 3 ) result drawn from computer modelling of past and future radiative forcing caused by rising ozone concentration in the upper troposphere . The solar and longwave radiative model developed by Wang et al . ( 1 991 ) wa used for calculating the change in radiative forcing to the troposphere-surface system that can be ascribed to changing concentration in ozone and other greenhouse gas . Nitric oxide emission from aircraft are a prime suspect for the observed increase in upper tropospheric ozone . The inference can be drawn that a radiative forcing of 0.2 to 0.35 Wm-2 Will result from a doubling of aircraft emission over the next two decade . This will amount to 10 to 25 percent of the radiative forcing attributable to CO2 alone for the same period . The effect of doubling aircraft emission will increase a stratospheric ozone concentration recover from the recent buildup of harmful chlorofluorocarbon . A large fraction of the radiative forcing that occurred during the 1970 to 1990 period can be attributed to increase in tropospheric ozone a opposed to increase in other greenhouse gas .

The impact is found to be qualitatively ambiguous , and highly sensitive to the manner in which the fund saved are distributed . The effect is adverse where the budgetary saving are used to fund economy-wide cut in personal taxation and/or deficit reduction . In other case the effect may be neutral or beneficial .

aVThis paper examines the role of water vapour a a greenhouse gas and discus it role in the evolution of the atmosphere of Venus , Earth and Mars . The paper focus on how the greenhouse effect operates on Earth and describes the feedback between temperature and water vapour that is thought to play a key role in global warming induced by increasing concentration of carbon dioxide . A method for analysing the contribution of water vapour to the greenhouse effect using satellite observation is discussed . It is shown how this contribution varies in a directly proportional way with the amount of water vapour vertically integrated through the column of the atmosphere . Based on the result obtained from the analysis of satellite data , it is established that the sensitivity of the greenhouse effect to changing sea surface temperature is not uniform over the globe and is significantly greater over warmer ocean . The relevance of the result to the water vapour feedback is discussed .

aVThis note discus the representation of steric sea level in ocean circulation model . Changes in steric sea level are caused when change in the density of the water column imply an expansion or contraction of the column . Models usually intake the Boussinesq approximation and conserve volume , rather than mass , and so do not properly represent expansion or contraction . This mean that although expansion/contraction is included in the equation of state , it is not accounted for by the model dynamic . In this note , we examine the equation governing the time evolution of the sea level displacement . It is shown that requiring conservation of mass , rather than volume , introduces a new term to this equation . A simple example is used to show the relationship of the new term to the surface buoyancy flux . The equilibrium response to the new term ha two part . One part consists of the Goldsbrough and Stommel gyre , for which , in the ocean interior , vortex stretching due to the local expansion/contraction of the water column is balanced by change in planetary vorticity . The other part corresponds to the ''inverse barometer . '' The effect is to adjust sea level by a globally uniform but time-varying factor , determined by the net expansion/contraction of the global ocean . Since this correction is globally uniform , it ha no dynamical significance . Both the Goldsbrough/Stommel gyre and the inverse barometer solution are missing from model a currently formulated . This doe not represent a serious error . However , if comparison is made with observation of sea level , model-calculated sea level should be adjusted by a globally uniform , time-varying factor , determined by the net expansion/contraction of the global ocean . This would be important for assessing the likely rise in sea level in response to global warming .

aVA model for predicting the spatial distribution of the major vegetation zone in Siberia is developed from bioclimatological consideration . Driving variable are growing degree-days ( 5 degree C base ) , Budyko 's dryness index , and Conrad 's continentality index . Because these index reflect the underlying climatic factor determining plant ' requirement for warmth , drought resistance , and cold tolerance , they define the main feature of vegetation zonation . Climatic input ( monthly mean temperature , precipitation , vapor pressure , cloudiness , and albedo ) are obtained from a global climatic database , supplemented by additional weather station in Siberia ; resolution is 0.5 degree longitude by 0.5 degree latitude . The performance of the model is examined by comparing our Siberian vegetation prediction with the landscape map of the USSR by Isachenko , a map that wa not used for model development . The pattern of vegetation predicted by the Siberian vegetation model generally match well with the vegetation pattern on Isachenko 's map . The general location of all vegetation zone are predicted correctly . This visual impression is also borne out statistically , with K-statistics for judging agreement between the map showing good agreement ( 0.55 < kappa < 0.7 ) at all scale of comparison ( from 0.5 degree by 0.5 degree pixel to 5 degree by 5 degree block of pixel ) . The model is also useful for estimating the change in equilibrium condition due to hypothesized event such a CO2-induced global warming , for retrospective comparison using the paleorecord , and for carbon budget assessment .

aVAs part of the Combustion 2000 Program of the US Department of Energy , advanced low-emission boiler system are being developed for future coal-fired power plant . These plant will be extremely clean , highly efficient and economic , by employing emerging and state-of-the-art technology . The emission of SO. , NO ( x ) and particulate from the plant will be much lower than the current new source performance standard ( NSPS ) , and the net plant efficiency of generating electricity will be higher than that of today 's pulverized-coal-fired utility plant . The high plant efficiency result in low fuel use and reduced emission of gas ( CO2 ) associated with global warming . At present , engineering development of advanced system is being conducted by three industry team . The development work includes new emission control technology , state-of-the-art boiler design and low-temperature heat recovery system for improved plant efficiency , system for improved ash disposability and reduced waste generation , and optimum system integration and plant control . The technology considered by these team for low-emission boiler system are discussed .

aVThis paper describes how variation in agricultural policy and climatic condition have influenced maize production and food security in 20th-century Mexico . We describe the Mexican food system today and how economic policy ha influenced food output in effort to attain food security based on the goal of national self-sufficiency . We examine the impact of climate variability on agricultural production ; the way in which agricultural policy ha interacted with climate to change vulnerability to environmental and social change and the implication of global warming for the future of Mexican agriculture . Finally , we discus the implication of the changing economic environment a Mexico ha opened it economy - for example , through the North American Free Trade Agreement . Our goal is to provide a context for thinking about the implication of two type of global change for Mexico - the internationalization of economy and the widespread transformation of the environment .

aVAir quality regulation are encouraging the use of electric vehicle at urban airport across the United States . In many way , airport offer an ideal application for EVs , given the short distance and predictable route that airport vehicle typically travel . Even considering the emission from power plant supplying electricity to an airport , the replacement of internal combustion vehicle with comparable electric-powered vehicle significantly reduces pollutant that contribute to such environmental problem a smog , haze , and global warming . Through EPRI 's Airport Electrification Project , utility in urban area are working in partnership with their airport customer to devise strategy for the cost-effective implementation of EVs .

aVProjections of climate impact on crop yield simulated for different General Circulation Model ( GCM ) scenario are used , in a recursively dynamic general equilibrium framework , to account for potential economy-wide impact of climate change in Egypt , Comparing impact projection to those obtained under a reference , business-as-usual , scenario assuming some moderate change in the political , economic or technological sphere , indicates that global warming ha potentially negative effect . The analysis is based on a global assessment of potential climate change-induced variation in world commodity production and trade . The Egyptian agricultural sector , and the non-agricultural sector to a lesser extent , are projected to be increasingly le self-sufficient . Specific potential adverse impact are identified . The simulation result show that high-cost adaptation measure involving major change in the agricultural system and practice may mitigate these adverse impact . Stimulating economic development of the rural area and creating appropriate condition for effective diffusion and development of technology - particularly for the agricultural sector - would seem a desirable strategy . Perhaps , more importantly , the simulation result show that the assumption of exogenously determined technological progress may be inappropriate , in which case the potential adverse impact of a future warming of the global climate are likely to be fewer than is indicated in this study - if prevailing constraint on productivity growth in the major food and feed grain are 'released ' by endogenous advance in technology .

aVThe topic of vegetarian nutrition can be approached from several angle , perhaps one of the most important being the impact that meat production is having on the underdeveloped world , where ancient rain forest are being cleared to provide land for cattle grazing . Debt-burdened country are turning over agricultural land to raise cattle and grain for feeding the cattle . These practice have resulted in le available land for the production of food , global warming because of the practice used for deforestation , exhaustion of the world 's water supply , and other adverse effect on the health of the world . The consumption of meat for food is taking a toll on the consumer and the health of the world 's poorest people . It is also contributing to an expanding need for foreign aid and growing world hunger .

aVPlatform carbonate and , particularly , reef ecosystem development ( with reef representing the acme of carbonate platform growth ) were highly cyclical in early to mid Paleozoic time , especially in relation to known or postulated time of global warming or cooling . These cycle do not appear to correspond to postulated 26 Ma rhythm seen in diversity pattern , nor were they regular . There were major period of worldwide reef expansion ( e.g . mid-Silurian-Late Devonian ) , corresponding to global warming well above present day norm , and period of complete global reef collapse ( e.g. , mid-Cambrian to mid-Ordovician , Late Devonian ) corresponding to global perturbation . At time of major reef expansion in the Paleozoic , area covered by equatorial reef and inter-reef carbonate platform are conservatively estimated to have periodically exceeded 5 million sq . km , nearly ten time that in the modern ocean . At time of global reef collapse , e.g . the Famennian ( Late Devonian ) , reef complex were completely absent or , at best , covered < 1000 sq . km . The chief factor relating to periodic collapse and mass extinction of reef biota appear to be related to climatic change and possibly ocean anoxic event , in turn a a response to large scale , geologically disruptive factor such a plate collision , plate movement across equatorial belt and volcanism . Stress ''signals '' in Cambrian through Cretaceous reef ecosystem appear to be comparable to those of today : whether these relate to physical versus biological stress is uncertain . Reef stress is evident in globally reduced area and thickness of reef carbonate production , the absence of large scale barrier reef system and reduction to smaller patch reef complex ( or , periodically , following mass extinction , no reef at all ) , reduced specie and genus diversity , small skeleton or colony , limited or no biotic zonation along reef transects , and arrested succession and ecologic replacement of complex , more highly evolved taxon by ''simpler '' , stress-resistant disaster taxon at the genus to ordinal ( or even phylum ) level .

aVThe Koppen climate classification system [ Koppen , 1923 ] is a scheme that provides an objective numerical basis for defining regional climatic type based on temperature and precipitation . Through the year it ha been used a a scientific and teaching tool for prescribing the general world pattern of climate . Here for the first time an evaluation of the system is performed by employing coextensive temperature and precipitation data over the N. Hemisphere for the last 140 year . First the global pattern of climate type sensitivity is obtained . From this pattern it is discovered that several climate type exhibit a rather strong variability . Since all climate type depend on temperature we then tested whether or not the above variability is due to the fact that over the last 140 year the global climate system exhibit a well documented positive temperature trend known a global warming . We found that the Koppen system is rather insensitive to the observed global warming and concluded that overall the system performs rather poorly over Europe and Asia whereas it appears adequate over N.America and N.Africa .

aVThe age class structure of ampeliscid population is determined largely by competition for space . Population density of the various ampeliscid specie are regulated by a balance between required carbon flux rate to the seafloor , predation rate , competition for space and reproductive potential . The largest taxon require high organic matter input and low predation rate to mature and reproduce . Reductions in organic matter flux favor smaller taxon . Low predation rate favor larger taxon , which can out-compete the smaller taxon for available space . High predation rate favor smaller taxon , which have a higher reproductive rate and are therefore more effective colonizer . The above factor can explain the relative concentration of Ampelisca macrocephala , Ampelisca birulai and Byblis spp. , the most abundant ampeliscids in the northern Bering Sea . Elevated predation loss to gray whale will depress the density of the large-sized A. macrocephala population and increase the density of the smallest specie , A. birulai . Global warming should elevate ampeliscid food requirement , and may also lead to elevated predation rate , both selecting for smaller specie .

aVWhile ecologist involved in management or policy often are advised to learn to deal with uncertainty , there are a number of component of global environmental change of which we are certain-certain that they are going on , and certain that they are human-caused . Some of these are largely ecological change , and all have important ecological consequence . Three of the well-documented global change are : increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere ; alteration in the biogeochemistry of the global nitrogen cycle ; and ongoing land use/land cover change . Human activity-now primarily fossil fuel combustion-has increased carbon dioxide concentration from similar to 280 to 355 mu L/L since 1800 ; the increase is unique , at least in the past 160 000 yr , and several line of evidence demonstrate unequivocally that it is human-caused . This increase is likely to have climatic consequences-and certainly it ha direct effect on biota in all Earth 's terrestrial ecosystem . The global nitrogen cycle ha been altered by human activity to such an extent that more nitrogen is fixed annually by humanity ( primarily for nitrogen fertilizer , also by legume crop and a a byproduct of fossil fuel combustion ) than by all natural pathway combined . This added nitrogen alters the chemistry of the atmosphere and of aquatic ecosystem , contributes to eutrophication of the biosphere , and ha effect on biological diversity in the most affected area . Finally , human land use/land cover change ha transformed one-third to one-half of Earth 's ice-free surface . This in and of itself probably represents the most important component of global change now and will for some decade to come ; it ha profound effect on biological diversity on land and on ecosystem downwind and downstream of affected area . Overall , any clear dichotomy between pristine ecosystem and human-altered area that may have existed in the past ha vanished , and ecological research should account for this reality . These three and other equally certain component of global environmental change are the primary cause of anticipated change in climate , and of ongoing loss of biological diversity . They are caused in turn by the extraordinary growth in size and resource use of the human population . On a broad scale , there is little uncertainty about any of these component of change or their cause . However , much of the public belief the causes-even the existence-of global change to be uncertain and contentious topic . By speaking out effectively , we can help to shift the focus of public discussion towards what can and should be done about global environmental change .

aVCoral reef are threatened by numerous anthropogenic impact , some of which have already had major effect worldwide . These unique tropical environment harbor a high diversity of coral , reef invertebrate , fish and other animal and plant . In most taxon , the specie diversity of reef-associated organism is poorly understood because many of the specie have yet to be collected and described . High coral mortality ha been associated with natural event such a hurricane , predator outbreak and period of high temperature , but ha also resulted from excess nutrient in sewage and from specific pollutant . Reef coral and associated organism are also threatened by the possibility of global warming which will result in rising sea level and period of increased temperature stress , and which may also bring increased storm frequency and intensity . Although the recent extensive episode of coral bleaching in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific can not be causally related to global warming at this time , the close link between bleaching and temperature suggests that global warming will result in severe change in coral assemblage . Major reef destruction ha followed outbreak of the predatory seastar Acanthaster planci in the Pacific . Although this is considered part of a natural disturbance cycle , there are indication that altered land use pattern and reduction of predator on this seastar by human activity may have increased the severity of outbreak . Recreational and commercial use of reef ha also increased , and ha caused extensive damage , especially near area of high population density . One of the most obvious and widespread loss to reef biota is the reduction in fish population from intense overfishing in most reef area of the world . Coasts without adequately managed reef have suffered intense overfishing for both local and export purpose , to the point where the positive effect of fish on those reef have been compromised . The combination of these destructive factor ha altered reef in all locality , and many that were once considered protected by distance and low population density are now being exploited a well . On the positive side , improved understanding of ecological process on reef combined with concerted conservation effort have managed to protect some extensive area of reef for the future .

aVWe measured aboveground biomass allocation of Pinus ponderosa on hydrothermally altered andesite in montane and desert climate . Thus substrate wa held constant while climate varied . Trees from montane climate had higher leaf mass per unit cross-sectional area of sapwood ( functional conducting xylem ) than tree from desert climate , suggesting that a functional response to difference in climate had occurred . Our result also indicate that sapwood mass : leaf mass ratio of P. ponderosa may increase approximate to 50 % with a 5 degree C change in mean growing-season temperature , approximately the difference between our montane and desert site . High proportional allocation of biomass to sapwood may improve water relation of P. ponderosa , but because sapwood contains living parenchyma , respiratory cost may be high . Site-specific regression equation were used to calculate aboveground biomass allocation for simulated montane and desert tree with the same diameter at breast height , dbh . Simulated montane tree were 46-52 % taller than desert tree , and montane tree 10 cm in dbh had twice the total aboveground mass of desert counterpart . Simulated 50-cm montane and desert tree were almost identical in total mass , even though the montane tree wa 46 % taller . The predicted proportion of biomass allocated to bole sapwood increased with size for both montane and desert model ; however , the 50-cm desert model contained 8 % more total sapwood mass than the taller montane model . Total biomass of branch wa similar for paired model of all size class ; however , biomass of primary and secondary branch differed considerably . The 50-cm desert model had twice a much biomass in primary branch in comparison to the montane model , whereas the montane model had 3 time more biomass in secondary branch than the desert model . For 10-cm tree of the desert and montane model 29 and 33 % of the biomass were leaf , respectively . In larger tree , leaf allocation decreased to 5 and 7 % for desert and montane model , respectively . The effect of climate on biomass allocation , such a reported here , and corresponding change in whole-plant assimilation rate must be incorporated into growth-response model used to predict future fluctuation in forest productivity due to global climate change .

aVThis paper provides an overview of the commercially successful CFC-free rigid polyurethane insulating product now established in the UK market , which have been made available because of the need to move away from the use of potent ozone depleting CFC blowing agent used for the past 35 year . Detailed evidence is included to support the claim that the performance of these new product and their life expectancy is equal to that of their CFC based counterpart . It show that because of the great diversity of product and application , that currently five different blowing agent are used since whilst many ozone benign blowing agent exist , none match the other unique feature of the CFCs R11 and R12 entirely . Nevertheless it is demonstrated that the product now in use in the UK , by comparison with their CFC counterpart , are playing a significant part in eliminating the threat to the ozone layer , whilst at the same time being able to continue to make their significant contribution to the reduction of CO2 emission , believed to be the main cause of global warming .

aVThe uptake and redistribution of chlorofluorocarbon ( CFCs ) CFC-11 and CFC-12 are studied in a series of world , ocean model experiment . In part 1 of this study the sensitivity of the simulated CFC distribution to the model parameterization of air-sea CFC flux is examined within a control experiment . The control experiment represents a low-resolution ocean model with global coverage and a proper seasonal cycling in surface thermohaline and wind stress condition . The specification of a surface ocean CFC concentration that is instantaneously in saturated equilibrium with the atmosphere is found to flux too much CFC into the model . Signatures of CFC-11 are found to be grossly overestimated in region of deep and bottom water formation , both in the surface mixed layer and at depth . The use of a classical air-sea gas exchange formula ( even one with a simplified gas transfer velocity that is independent of wind speed ) is seen to greatly improve the CFC simulation at depth . In addition , the model reproduces many of the observed trend in surface CFC concentration ; namely , undersaturation in region of deep convective overturn and near-surface upwelling and supersaturation in the summer mixed layer . In further sensitivity experiment , we consider the effect of sea ice cover in limiting air-sea gas exchange in polar water . It is found that bottom water in the Arctic Ocean and around the Antarctic continent is significantly reduced in CFC content once region covered with sea ice are limited to fractional air-sea gas exchange . This more physically meaningful framework is found to further reduce the spurious uptake of CFC-11 and CFC-12 found under a ''saturated surface '' assumption . In a final sensitivity experiment the gas exchange rate is parameterized using a complete wind speed and Schmidt number dependence . The wind speed dependent gas forcing increase the surface CFC equilibration rate under the subpolar westerly . On the other hand , the polar and tropical ocean witness reduced CFC uptake under a wind speed dependent flux regime . Simulated ocean CFC concentration are compared directly with observational data in certain key area for deep and bottom water formation . It is found that a reasonable representation of oceanic CFC is achieved in the convected water column in the Weddell and Labrador Seas . In contrast , deep water that have left the convective area with the model ocean current are found to be deficient in CFC-11 in the North Atlantic Ocean . This is because the model advective timescale for North Atlantic Deep Water ( NADW ) outflow across the equator is too long compared with observed ocean estimate . The long timescale is not due to unrealistically sluggish deep current . Rather , the path of NADW outflow includes a loop eastward from the Labrador Sea into the Northeastern Atlantic Basin , effectively increasing the required outflow journey by around 4000 km . This age the water mass by almost 10 year , thereby yielding significantly lower CFC concentration in the NADW extension . In addition , the outflow signature spread too far into the eastern North Atlantic , presumably because the advective process is too broad and the horizontal diffusion too strong at depth . Contrasting the North Atlantic , bottom water CFC ventilation in the Southern Ocean is found to be too strong , even when significant level of surface undersaturation are simulated in polar water . CFC-tagged water flowing into the deep South Atlantic basin ( from the Weddell Sea formation zone ) are too enriched in CFC11 , even when the deep signature adjacent to the Antarctic shelf remain close to observation . This suggests that the advective timescale for bottom water ventilation is too rapid in the Southern Ocean . In addition , too much convective overturn persists in the Southern Ocean at 55 degree S-70 degree S , with unrealistically deep CFC-11 penetration noted at particular longitude . This is because not enough older ( CFC-deprived ) water recirculates and upwells into the Southern Ocean . For example , more upwelled circumpolar deep water in the Southern Ocean would weaken the CFC-11 concentration by contributing to a lower CFC mixture and by suppressing the convective activity in the region . Bottom and deep level CFC signature are broad and diffuse compared with the real ocean . The broadness of the CFC imprint is due , in part , to the model resolution , which give any convective event a spatial extent of at least 3.75 degree longitude by 4.5 degree latitude and a bottom level CFC signal thickness in excess of 800 m. An important finding of our study is that the vertical convection of unstable water act a the efficient tracer ventilator of the ocean system . This ha significant implication for numerical study of the world 's climate , since the meridional overturning ha traditionally been considered the reason for the ocean 's moderating influence during global warming scenario . Our study suggests that the vertical convection would play a much greater role over the typical timescale for anthropogenic climate change .

aVSeasonal and inter-annual variation of several surface climate variable near the Great Barrier Reef ( GBR ) are described for the 30-year period , 1958-1987 . Large inter-annual variability of rainfall and river flow in coastal Queensland is linked to the aperiodic influence of El Nino-Southern Oscillation event . These event also affect sea surface temperature and wind field , though the inter-annual variability of these variable is not a large a rainfall and river flow . The major impact on water of the GBR appear to be greatly increased freshwater input , reduced surface radiation ( and thus light level ) and enhanced tropical cyclone activity during anti-El Nino event . El Nino event have le effect on climate of the GBR because they tend to maintain winter-like condition . The effect of this background of high variability in the physical environment on reef process must be considered when examining change in such process , change in climate ( e.g . due to global warming ) or increase in anthropogenic impact .

aVPolicy maker , charged both with identifying Possible national response strategy to climate change and with negotiating international convention and protocol , need tool which enable them to estimate the implication for climate change of a wide range of policY option and which summarize the uncertainty surrounding global climate change . One such tool , recently constructed for the Environment Directorate of the Commission of the European Communities,1 consists of an interactive climate change impact assessment model called ESCAPE . This paper describes the model framework and illustrates the use of ESCAPE using a range of input scenario reflecting different global policy , economic and technological future . Three important characteristic of the global climate change problem are well illustrated : past emission of greenhouse gas and the inertia of the global development path have committed the world to future warming irrespective of current and near-future policy intervention ; the efficacy of a climate Policy implemented solely within the EC on altering the course of future climate change is very small ; and the impact of climate change on the economy and environment of the European Community differ markedly between northern and southern Europe .

aVIn northern Russia , from the time meteorological measurement began in the early nineteenth century to the end of that century , the air temperature wa characterized by a general decrease ( approximately 1 degree C ) . It then rose up to the 1950s ( by 0.6 degree C ) . A subsequent slight fall in temperature lasted until the mid 1970s . Since then a further rise ha been observed ( 0.6-0.9 degree C ) . Temperatures in the upper horizon of permafrost over the last 10-20 year are in good agreement with recent global warming trend . For the European north-east during the period 1970-90 a rise in temperature at a depth of 3 m amounted to 0.6-0.7 degree C on average . However , this rise is related not necessarily to a rise in air temperature , but more likely to an increase in snow cover .

aVConsiderable evidence ha emerged of a substantial decade-long change in the north Pacific atmosphere and ocean lasting from about 1976 to 1988 . Observed significant change in the atmospheric circulation throughout the troposphere revealed a deeper and eastward shifted Aleutian low pressure system in the winter half year which advected warmer and moister air along the west coast of North America and into Alaska and colder air over the north Pacific . Consequently , there were increase in temperature and sea surface temperature ( SSTs ) along the west coast of North America and Alaska but decrease in SSTs over the central north Pacific , a well a change in coastal rainfall and streamflow , and decrease in sea ice in the Bering Sea . Associated change occurred in the surface wind stress , and , by inference , in the Sverdrup transport in the north Pacific Ocean . Changes in the monthly mean flow were accompanied by a southward shift in the storm track and associated synoptic eddy activity and in the surface ocean sensible and latent heat flux . In addition to the change in the physical environment , the deeper Aleutian low increased the nutrient supply a seen through increase in total chlorophyll in the water column , phytoplankton and zooplankton . These change , along with the altered ocean current and temperature , changed the migration pattern and increased the stock of many fish specie . A north Pacific ( NP ) index is defined to measure the decadal variation , and the temporal variability of the index is explored on daily , annual , interannual and decadal time scale . The dominant atmosphere-ocean relation in the north Pacific is one where atmospheric change lead SSTs by one to two month . However , strong tie are revealed with event in the tropical Pacific , with change in tropical Pacific SSFs leading SSTs in the north Pacific by three month . Changes in the storm track in the north Pacific help to reinforce and maintain the anomalous circulation in the upper troposphere . A hypothesis is put forward outlining the tropical and extratropical realtionships which stress the role of tropical forcing but with important feedback in the extratropics that serve to emphasize the decadal relative to interannual time scale . The Pacific decadal timescale variation are linked to recent change in the frequency and intensity of El Nino versus La Nina event but whether climate change associated with ''global warming '' is a factor is an open question .

aVNitrous oxide is one of the greenhouse gas which together with carbon dioxide , methane and chlorofluorocarbon ha an influence on global warming . The average increase of atmospheric nitrous oxide ha been estimated at about 0.2 similar to 0.3 % per year . It is impotant , therefore , that source and emission rate of nitrous oxide are investigated all over the world . In this work , the nitrous oxide concentration in the soil at 80 cm in depth at 30 site wa investigated in the Tokyo metropolitan area . As a result , it wa found that the concentration of nitrous oxide wa higher in the soil air than in the atmosphere for all of the sampling site .

aVCiguatera fish poisoning is a disease causing human health problem for person eating fish from tropical sea or for extra-tropical resident who have eaten fish imported from tropical sea . Of the estimated 1,300 case of ciguatera in south Florida , probably 10 % are from fish caught in south Florida water ; the rest are purchased from restaurant or seafood market in south Florida who sell fish specie which are potentially ciguatoxic . Many fish specie are misidentified by restaurateur or are from non-Florida source , especially the Bahamas . This paper document the ( a ) specie , ( b ) location , and ( c ) size of fish which have caused ciguatera intoxication in the Florida Keys , a well a other location along the Florida east coast . Evidence is presented from other tropical area that ( 1 ) increase in sea surface temperature from global warming , ( 2 ) eutrophication from human activity , and ( 3 ) anthropogenic alteration such a dredging , filling , and coral reef destruction may increase the incidence of ciguatera in the future in the Florida Keys and elsewhere .

aVA forecast of expected evolution of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) emission in Portugal between 1988 and 2010 is presented . Predictions show that CO2 emission will almost double in the next twenty year . The equivalent potential CO2 emission from nitrogen oxide ( NO ( x ) ) and volatile organic compound ( VOC ) , for a time horizon of 20 year , is also presented NO ( x ) and VOC emission seem to make a significant contribution to the global warming potential of Portuguese emission . Estimates Of CO2 emission due to forest fire have been made , oriented towards the study of the Portuguese contribution to the global warming . If the burned area exceeds 100000 ha this contribution could reach 7 % of the total Portuguese CO2 emission . The global warming potential of Portuguese forest fire emission were also calculated The climate change predicted to Portugal could be responsible for an increase in the forest fire and consequently for a greater contribution of it emission to the total value . It wa concluded that it is important to quantify emission of the greenhouse gas , including the contribution of forest fire emission , not only in Portugal , but in all the Southern European country .

aVThe world ha become highly alerted to the global warming problem . The major greenhouse gas is CO2 , large quantity of which are produced by combustion of fossil fuel ; coal being a major contributor . Whereas a great deal of effort is being expended on the science of climate change , very little work ha gone into mitigation technology . This is now changing . The option include improved energy utilization efficiency , fuel switching , non-fossil energy source , and pre- and post-combustion removal and disposal of CO2 from central power station . Another approach is the pre-combustion conversion of fossil fuel to a carbon-rich fraction and a hydrogen-rich fraction ; storing the carbon-rich and only utilizing the hydrogen-rich fraction . By coprocessing with the biomass , the CO2 emission from fossil fuel can be reduced to negligible value . Assessment of these system is discussed .

aVThe World Climate Research Programme ha the dual objective of determining the extent of climate predictability and the influence of human activity on climate . To meet these objective , the WCRP ha instituted a set of research program focusing on specific aspect of the physical climate system . Global climate model are at the core of the WCRP . Models provide a structural framework around which to organize research ; they are used to identify knowledge gap and to assimilate data ; and they are used for prediction and simulation . Time scale of interest stretch from those of numerical weather prediction , through interannual variability to decadal climate change . As the time scale of interest expands we must include more and more component of the climate system . Physically-based global climate model will also be the framework upon which to build full global change model . Modelling and other research activity internationally coordinated by the WCRP have provided the basis for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) assessment of global warming and the proposed international centre for climate prediction research . A major thrust of the WCRP is to reduce the uncertainty in simulation of climatic response to increasing concentration of greenhouse gas . There is need for a continuous interaction between the modelling community and those scientist studying the process and data . Through international coordination and national contribution considerable progress ha been made over the past decade and we anticipate similar success in the future .

aVCARBON monoxide play an important role in the oxidizing capacity of the Earth 's atmosphere , and may thereby indirectly affect the concentration of many man-made and natural trace gas , which in turn affect climate , atmospheric chemistry and the ozone layer ( 1 ) . CO is produced in the atmosphere by the oxidation of methane and other hydrocarbon , and is released into the atmosphere from automobile , agricultural waste and the burning of savanna ( 1-4 ) . Recent estimate ' show that human activity such a these are presently responsible for more than half the annual emission of CO. During the 1980s there wa evidence that atmospheric CO concentration were increasing at similar to 1.2 +/- 0.6 % per year , leading to feedback that could amplify global warming . Here we present a continuation of these measurement which show that from 1988 to 1992 global CO concentration have started to decline rapidly at a rate of about -2.6 +/- 0.8 % per gear . A recent study ( 5 ) ha verified our finding with data from the past 3-4 year . The rate of decrease is particularly rapid in the Southern Hemisphere ; we hypothesize that this may reflect a reduction in tropical biomass burning . The total amount of carbon monoxide in the atmosphere is le now than a decade ago .

aVSince model of global warming predict that climatic change will be greatest in the Arctic and might already be in progress , it is prudent to attempt to understand the rapidly changing thermal regime on Eurasian cold region . In this paper the author try to evaluate the probable catastrophic implication of global climatic change in the cold region of Eurasia . The impact on Man activity in permafrost region is discussed .

aVThere is a much better correlation between energy use and GNP or GDP when the latter are calculated using purchasing-power parity ( PPP ) rather than market-exchange rate ( MER ) . Using PPP-adjusted GDP also show that the larger developing country of the world are not , when viewed overall , le energy-efficient than their industrialized country counterpart . The per caput GDPs of the larger developing country are typically about 1/10 to 1/4 of those of the O.E.C.D . country , on a PPP-adjusted basis , rather than in the range of 1/80 to 1/10 on an MER-basis . This result may have major implication for future energy requirement of the developing country , associated emission of CO2 , and formulation of policy for addressing global climate change .

aVWithin the study region in southern Israel , the annual average rainfall during the period 1961-1990 increased by up to approximately 30 % , with only minor change in the control station representing the central and northern part of the country . The retreat of aridity is made even more pronounced by an appreciable decrease in the coefficient of variation ( CV ) in nearly all of the 30 rain station within the study region . The geographical area where maximum CV reduction were found correlate well with the area where intensive land-use variation took place with the initial operation of the National Water Carrier in 1964 . A global climate change in the sea surface temperature starting in the early 1960 's may have had an effect to increase seasonal rainfall . Current research is aimed at resolving this issue .

aVEmission rate of CH , from rice paddy field were measured in the central plain of Thailand . The measurement taken monthly during the cultivation period showed a significant difference in CH4 emission rate among three site . One paddy field , in Suphan Buri , showed a relatively high emission of CH4 , with average flux of 19.5-32.2 mg m-2 h-1 . The average flux from the other two paddy field , in Khlong Luang and Chai Nat , were 3.8 and 1.6 Mg M-2 h-1 , respectively , being one order of magnitude lower than those from Suphan Buri . The low emission of CH4 at the two site wa attributed to the high concentration of sulfate in soil or the high soil Eh due to the lower abundance of the reducing capacity in relation to the oxidizing capacity of soil . The result suggest that it is essential to provide a data base of soil characteristic , such a soil type and chemical composition of soil affecting the oxidation-reduction process , a well a conduct extensive field measurement in various rice growing country to evaluate the global emission rate of CH4 from rice paddy field .

aVGlobal warming by the increase of atmospheric CO2 concentration is one of the serious global environmental problem . For the investigation on the cause of atmospheric CO2 increase and the precisely prediction of future global warming , it is essential to understand the global carbon cycle among the atmosphere , terrestrial ecosystem and ocean , and to describe it by mathematical model on the basis of ecology and engineering . As a first step for constructing such a carbon cycle model , we previously developed a model describing the carbon exchange between the atmosphere and the terrestrial ecosystem , where the carbon dynamic in soil were significantly simplified a the first approximation . In this work a dynamic model describing the soil carbon dynamic wa developed to improve the carbon cycle model for the terrestrial ecosystem . The vertical distribution of soil carbon and the soil carbon content in various kind of soil were in good agreement with those previously reported in the literature . The total carbon content in soil over the world wa also estimated by using the model . It can be said that a model of soil carbon dynamic working a a part of carbon cycle model between the atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystem wa established .

aVThis paper present an attempt to integrate method of landscape regionalization and already established model approach which describe the soil water budget , the dynamic of soluble and adsorbed substance a well a the different process of the soil nitrogen budget . This integration lead to the Catchment Related Water & Substance Simulation System ( CWSS ) , which give the ability to carry out simulation for the area of small catchment . CWSS is a modular process-based system that simulates the soil water and ground water dynamic , surface runoff , soil heat budget and organic carbon and nitrogen transformation process . It give the ability to calculate water and substance budget for a number of landscape cell , determined by the heterogeneity of soil condition , elevation and landuse . Water and substance input into creek , river and lake concerning to the catchment area can be simulated with a high temporal resolution . There are many scientific and management application , for which this system could be used . For example it could help address ecological issue like eutrophication , effect of global warming , water management and soil erosion . Methods of parameter estimation and procedure concerning the regional aspect of soil variability , elevation and landuse condition are described . The combination with a geographical information system ( GIS ) and the deduction of input value from various data set , which are available all over the country , are described . Some simulation result related to the catchment of Lake Belau ( north Germany ) will be discussed . In this area nitrate concentration of ground water exceed the legal limit for drinking water ( 50 mg NO3/l ) and a high degree of eutrophication characterizes the lake .

aVWe examined the effect of climate on aboveground biomass allocation of ponderosa pine ( Pinus ponderosa ) by measuring tree in disjunct forest stand growing on the same substrate at high-elevation montane site and low-elevation desert site . Climatic difference between the site were comparable to the difference between present and future climate of interior North America that is expected to result from a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration . Relative to the montane population , the desert population allocated a greater proportion of biomass to sapwood ( functional xylem ) at the expense of foliage . The leaf/sapwood area ratio and percent of aboveground biomass in sapwood for tree of the same height were 0.201 m2 cm-2 and 58 % for montane tree and 0.104 m2 cm-2 and 71 % for desert tree . In a phytotron experiment , increase in net photosynthesis and net assimilation rate for seedling grown under future condition of high CO2 and temperature were offset by a decrease in leaf area ratio . As wa observed for large tree at different elevation , increased temperature caused an increase in biomass allocation to stem in the phytotron seedling . Thus , CO2- and temperature-driven shift in biomass allocation negated the effect on growth of the CO2-driven increase in carbon assimilation rate . Our data from the controlled growth chamber and field experiment suggest that future climate condition , including elevated atmospheric CO2 , may not stimulate growth and productivity of ponderosa pine .

aVInformation on the history of the Earth system is an important element in assessing global change . Analysis of air trapped in natural ice ha provided data on the pre-industrial concentration of greenhouse gas like CO2 and CH4 , and their recent increase-and ha shown that the latter effect can be unequivocally attributed to human activity . Such data also provide the basis for estimating that the present anthropogenic greenhouse forcing is 2.5 W/m2 . Records for the last 150 000 year show the variation of Earth system parameter during one and a half glacial cycle . The presence of the frequency of the orbital forcing indicates that change in these parameter are the main cause of the glacial-interglacial cycle . The concentration of CO2 and CH , vary in parallel with global temperature ; whilst CH4 closely follows the climatic variation , the relationship of CO2 with climate is much more complicated . Temperature in the Northern and the Southern Hemispheres varied closely in phase during a glacial cycle . In the Northern Hemisphere , change in albedo ( due to change in ocean ice cover ) are thought to amplify the orbital forcing ; the Southern Hemisphere climate may have been forced to follow the climate of the Northern Hemisphere due to the changing greenhouse forcing . From the last glacial maximum to the present interglacial the greenhouse forcing increased by ca . 2.5 W/m2 . In addition to the smoothed long-term climatic trend over a glacial cycle ( known from ocean sediment record ) , high resolution record ( from ice core and lake sediment ) reveal rapid climatic change by several degree within a decade or so . The relatively stable climate during the present interglacial is exceptional ; previously , the climate wa much more variable , probably due to change in deep water formation in the North Atlantic . Recent ice core result , indicate that this instability may also have occurred during the last interglacial , when it wa around 2-degrees-C warmer than at present , raising the possibility that the climate could become unstable if human-induced global warming occurs . Such unexpected result show the complexity of the Earth system and the need for an appraisal of our understanding of it behavior .

aVThis paper present the result of a new analysis of the global warming potential of emission from passenger car in the UK . Projections of future emission are combined with GWPs to present a picture of the overall potential of future car transport emission to affect the global climate . The projection from this modelling exercise point to the fact that the car transport sector will not be able to meet the international target of returning emission of greenhouse gas to their 1990 level by 2000 . Technological improvement will help to keep in check the total warming impact of car transport in the near future by reducing non-carbon dioxide emission . However , eventually demand increase will overcome this benefit unless further improvement , particularly in CO2 emission , can be achieved . This suggests a need for prompt introduction of longer-term measure to manage demand and increase trip efficiency . The result of our sensitivity analysis suggest that more work to better determine nitrous oxide emission factor should be given priority , that increasing diesel market share ha little impact , and that the uncertainty over actual GWP value do not appear to have a significant impact on the total warming potential of passenger car emission .

aVEstimates of the magnitude and spatial distribution of potential oceanic methane hydrate reservoir have been made from pressure-temperature phase relation and a plausible range of thermal gradient , sediment porosity , and pore filling taken from published source , based on two major theory of gas hydrate formation ( 1 ) in situ bacterial production and ( 2 ) pore fluid expulsion model . The implication of these two model on eventual atmospheric methane release , due to global warming , are briefly examined . The calculated range of methane volume in oceanic gas hydrate is 26.4 to 139.1 x 10 ( 15 ) m ( 3 ) , with the most likely value on the lower end of this range . The result for the bacterial model show a preferential distribution of hydrate at mid- to high latitude , with an equatorial enhancement in the case of the fluid migration model . The latter model also generates a deeper and thicker hydrate stability zone at most latitude than doe the former . Preliminary result suggest that the hydrate distribution predicted by the fluid migration model may be more consistent with observation . However , this preliminary finding is based on a very limited sample size , and there are high uncertainty in the assumption . The volume of methane hydrate within the uppermost 1 m of the hydrate stability zone and within 1 degrees-2 degree C of the equilibrium curve , assuming in situ bacterial generation , is 0.93-6.32 x 10 ( 12 ) m ( 3 ) , or 0.0035-0.012 % of the maximal estimated hydrate reservoir . Nevertheless this volume , if released uniformly over the next 100 year , is comparable to current CH4 release rate for several important CH4 source . Corresponding CH4 volume calculated using the fluid migration model are nearly 2 order of magnitude lower .

aVFourteen country have signed an agreement to take part in an initial three-year programme of research and development aimed at potential mitigation technique in response to the issue of global warming . Formed under the aegis of the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) , the programme brings together those country interested in establishing the technique , cost , and environmental consequence of removing CO2 and other greenhouse gas from fossil fuel-based power station flue gas and storing or otherwise disposing of them . The programme ha evaluated many fossil fuel power generation option , with the technology required for CO2 removal . Using the technical and economic result from these study the programme ha recently commenced a detailed specification for a series of full scale 'full fuel cycle ' study . The programme will culminate in proposal aimed at demonstration facility should any of the full fuel cycle technology show sufficient promise . In addition , the programme could be expanded to look in more detail at CO2 disposal option and the question of methane and it contribution to global warming . The project structure and work programme to date are described in outline and a summary of the result to date is given , with an overview of all of the technology involved .

aVRice field are considered to be among the highest source of atmospheric methane , an important source of global warming . In order to meet the projected rice need of the increasing world population , it is estimated that the annual world 's rough rice production must increase to 760 million ton ( a 65 % increase ) in the next 30 year . This will increase methane emission from rice-fields if current technology are kept . Methane emission from ricefields are affected by climate , water regime , soil property , and various cultural practice like irrigation and drainage , organic amendment , fertilization , and rice cultivar . Irrigated rice comprises 50 % of the world-harvested rice area and contributes 70 % to total rice production . Because of assured flooding during the growing period it is the primary source of methane . Rainfed rice emits le methane due to period of drought . Upland rice , being never flooded for a significant period of time , is not a significant source of methane . There is great potential to develop 'no regret ' mitigation option that are in accordance with increasing rice production .

aVA study at 79 degree N over the polar continental shelf off Ellef Ringes Island in 1989-1990 provided year-round measurement of particulate matter sedimentation in a permanently ice covered region of the Arctic Ocean . Mean annual Aux rate of mass ( 1.1 g m ( -2 ) ) , organic carbon ( 134 mg m ( -2 ) ) , nitrogen ( 24 mg m ( -2 ) ) , chlorophyll a ( 3 mg m ( -2 ) ) and biogenic silicon ( II mg m ( -2 ) ) were determined by deployment of two sediment trap from the Canadian Ice Island at a water depth of 100 m. High flue of mass , biogenic silicon and inorganic matter occurred between July and September during the melt-water runoff . Maximum sedimentation of organic matter and chlorophyll a occurred in August and September when centric diatom and zooplankton fecal pellet were numerous in sample . Between February and June , when mass flue were low , settled particle were organically rich with low carbon : nitrogen ratio ( 4-8 ) in contrast to higher value ( 6-12 ) during the melt-water period . Mineralogy showed that chlorite , mica , illite and quartz were abundant in settled particle collected in August , October and December . Similar mineral , thought to be supplied a small particle by eolian transport , are present in ice core and cryoconites on the Ice Island . The observation provide data for assessing future change in production and particle export for this ice-covered region of the Arctic Ocean that may be altered due to global warming and related change in ice cover .

aVWe consider the relative effectiveness of engineered system for collection and marine disposal of CO2 from fossil-fuel-fired power plant using comparison of the trend with time of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere from system with and without marine disposal . Since the retention time for CO2 increase rapidly with depth of disposal , from a few year in the mixed layer up to several century a the depth increase beyond 1000 m , deep ocean have been considered a potential storage site for CO2 . However , CO2 Collection and disposal consumes energy and produce extra CO2 . We show that some of this extra CO2 reach the atmosphere , so that atmospheric concentration from system with marine disposal ultimately exceed those from system without control . In some circumstance , they do so rapidly , making marine disposal le favorable than direct atmospheric release . The Global Warming Potential ( GWP ) can be used to compare different system , but result for GWP highlight the difficult issue of determining what time scale are important in considering option to reduce concern about global warming .

aVIn this paper we briefly describe the characteristic and the performance of our 1-D Muenster Climate Model . The model system consists of coupled model including gas cycle model , an energy balance model and a sea level rise model . The chemical feedback mechanism among greenhouse gas are not included . This model , which is a scientifically-based parameterized simulation model , is used here primarily to help ass the effectiveness of various plausible policy option in mitigating the additional man-made greenhouse warming and the resulting sea level rise . For setting priority it is important to ass the effectiveness of the various measure by which the greenhouse effect can be reduced . To this end we take a Scenario Business-as-Usual a a reference case ( Leggett et al. , 1992 ) and study the mitigating effect of the following four package of measure : The Copenhagen Agreements on CFC , HCFC , and halon reduction ( GECR , 1992 ) , the Tropical Forest Preservation Plan of the Climate Enquete-Commission of the German Parliament on CO , reduction ( ECGP , 1990 ) , a detailed reduction scheme for energy-related CO2 ( ECGP , 1990 ) , and a preliminary scheme for CH4 , CO , and N2O reduction ( Bach and Jain , 1992-1993 ) . The required reduction depends , among others , on the desired climate and ecosystem protection . This is defined by the Enquete-Commission and others a a mean global rate of surface temperature change of ca . 0.1-degrees-C per decade - assumed to be critical to many ecosystem - and a mean global warming ceiling of ca . 2-degrees-C in 2100 relative to 1860 . Our result show that the Copenhagen Agreements , the Tropical Forest Preservation Plan , the energy-related CO2 reduction scheme , and the CH , and N2O reduction scheme could mitigate the anthropogenic greenhouse warming by ca . 12 % , 6 % , 35 % , and 9 % respectively . Taken together , all four package of measure could reduce the man-made greenhouse effect by more than 60 % until 2100 ; i.e . over the climate sensitivity range 2.5-degrees-C ( 1.5 to 4.5 ) for 2 x CO2 , the warming could be reduced from 3.5-degrees-C ( 2.4 to 5.0 ) without specific measure to 1.3-degrees-C ( 0.9 to 2.0 ) with the above package of measure ; and likewise , the mean global sea level rise could be reduced from 65 cm ( 46 to 88 ) without specific measure to 32 cm ( 22 to 47 ) with the above measure . Finally , the model result also emphasize the importance of trace gas other than CO2 in mitigating additional man-made greenhouse warming . According to our preliminary estimate , CH4 could in the short term make a sizable contribution to the reduction of the greenhouse effect ( because of it relatively short lifetime of 10 yr ) , a could N2O in the medium and long term ( with a relatively long lifetime of 150 yr ) .

aVThe heat pump , a proven and reliable technology , ha the potential to reduce primary energy consumption and the corresponding CO2-emissions for heating and cooling in domestic , commercial and industrial application . The basic principle of heat pump technology and the anthrogenic CO2-formation under the given energy supply and demand situation in Europe and the related impact on global warming are described . An analysis of the energy flow between primary energy exploitation and the useful energy of different heating system clearly demonstrates the ability of electric heat pump to reduce primary energy consumption in Europe between 15 and 50 % , compared with oil- and gas-heating system . The corresponding reduction of CO2-emissions will be between 20 and 60 % and up to 85 % of other pollutant . The present status of alternative working fluid which do not contribute to ozone depletion is presented and the direct ( working fluid ) and indirect ( energy consumption ) impact of different heat pump on the greenhouse effect is discussed .

aVWeather and climate affect insect and other arthropod of importance to agriculture in a wide variety of way . Pest and beneficial insect , and insect vector of plant and animal disease , are all influenced both directly and indirectly by temperature , rainfall , wind , etc . These influence can be immediate or cumulative , and they can act either at the production site or , in the case of migrant specie , at location distant from it . Weather and climate influence , often very significantly , the development rate , survival , fitness , and level of activity of individual insect ; the phenology , distribution , size , and continuity of insect population ; migration and the re-establishment of population following local extinction ; the initiation of outbreak ; the susceptibility of crop and stock to insect attack ; and the capacity of producer to manage insect population . In Australia , the high variability of rainfall is of particular significance in determining the size and quality of insect population . Windborne migration can be important for transporting these population into agricultural region , and low winter temperature in the south of the continent limit the distribution of tropical specie . Current Australian research on these topic is directed mainly at the development of pest-forecasting system , and at estimating the impact of global greenhouse warming .

aVThe global atmosphere is a chemically complex and dynamic system , interacting both internally , mostly within the troposphere and stratosphere , and with the ocean , land , and living organism . Its composition is changing today , and ha also changed markedly over the last 160 000 yr. Environmentally-significant chemical process occurring in the atmosphere include those affecting the ozone layer and the level of radiatively active gas and particle . Methane , a very important greenhouse gas , ha major natural and anthropogenic source ; it is destroyed largely by reaction with the hydroxyl radical in the troposphere . Both it source and sink are strongly influenced by human activity . Nitrous oxide , with a similar range of source , and chlorofluorocarbon , purely anthropogenic , are also greenhouse gas ; however , their potency is offset partially by the ozone they destroy . Ozone , a key chemical and protective ultraviolet shield , ha a complex chemistry influenced by many other trace specie and is also an important greenhouse gas . Many other trace gas play a key role through their influence on the concentration of ozone , the hydroxyl radical , and methane . Gaseous sulfur compound , both natural and anthropogenic , are oxidized to particulate sulfate which have an important effect on albedo , counteracting the influence of the greenhouse gas . Atmospheric chemistry is therefore closely linked to industrial activity , climate , and land use through many complex environmental process ; these interaction can not be realistically described by single number such a potential for ozone depletion or global warming . The International Global Atmospheric Chemistry ( IGAC ) project is underway and dedicated to understanding this complex system through a combination of observation , theory , and laboratory and modelling study .

aVHaraden 's model for estimating the economic cost of global warming is analysed . We change his method of discounting and some of his input parameter in a manner consistent with physical and economic theory a well a empirical data . We then find much higher cost than Haraden found . These cost are compared to the cost of reducing CO2 emission and we find that deep cut of the emission of CO2 are preferable . A check of the sensitivity of our result with respect to some crucial parameter value doe not alter that conclusion .

aVMean global temperature have been predicted to increase in the next century , if so the frequency of extreme temperature event may also increase . Extreme temperature may damage plant tissue and consequently limit the survival of certain plant specie in a region . Elevated concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere alter plant allocation , physiology , and growth , and may accentuate or ameliorate the damage from extreme temperature . In this paper we explore the interactive effect of atmospheric CO2 concentration , nutrient level , and exposure to extreme temperature on seedling of three specie of temperate deciduous tree . A1-d exposure to extreme heat ( 45-degrees-C ) significantly decreased conductance the following day and decreased biomass a measured at both 35 and 105 d following the extreme temperature event , regardless of atmospheric CO2 concentration . The most shade-tolerant specie , striped maple , wa most severely impacted by the extreme heat event in both CO2 environment . Furthermore , striped maple seedling grown in elevated CO2 concentration had a significantly greater decrease in biomass due to the extreme heat event a compared with striped maple plant grown in ambient CO2 concentration at 35 d after the heat event ; however , al the end of the growing season at 105 d post treatment , this difference wa not significant . A one-night exposure to low temperature ( 4-degrees-C ) did not affect biomass for any of these specie . With an increase in global mean temperature , the frequency of extreme temperature event , particularly hot weather event , may increase and may extend to shaded understory site . If the frequency of extremely high temperature increase , the role that temperature extreme may play in changing competitive interaction and thus affecting community composition may increase in importance , a these temperature appear to severely alter plant survival and growth in some specie .

aVNuclear power is already a major international industry and the single largest source of electricity in Europe . As the world demand for energy increase rapidly , the developing country will rely heavily on their indigenous fossil fuel . The burning of fossil fuel will produce unacceptably high level of global-warming gas , unless the developed nation reduce their reliance on fossil fuel . The UK 's proven Sizewell design not only provides a mean to develop home industry but offer increasing export opportunity . This - together with the potential loss of a nuclear skill base in the UK - should be borne in mind by Government a it contemplates the Nuclear Review .

aVAs an alternative to current global warming policy proposal to freeze greenhouse gas ''emissions '' at their 1990 level by the year 2000 , this study examines the implication of a long-run objective of stabilizing greenhouse gas ''concentrations '' at low to moderate risk level by the year 2100 . The current proposal to control emission slow but do not end the build-up of concentration , and they could imply costly short-term adjustment of the energy industry . Our objective is to explore an alternative policy that could ( 1 ) stabilize induced climate change , ( 2 ) provide for the creation of international ''property right '' in the stratosphere by mean of tradable emission permit , and ( 3 ) be more intertemporally cost-effective . Our method for analyzing this effort is a tested , dynamic , price sensitive , global economic model to which is linked a climate change submodel . Together these model enable u to project price and quantity time path of energy , climate , and tradable permit variable under alternative policy action .

aVDue to restriction in the available computing resource and a lack of suitable observational data , transient climate change experiment with global coupled ocean-atmosphere model have been started from an initial state at equilibrium with the present day forcing . The historical development of greenhouse gas forcing from the onset of industrialization until the present ha therefore been neglected . Studies with simplified model have shown that this ''cold start '' error lead to a serious underestimation of the anthropogenic global warming . In the present study , a 150-year integration ha been carried out with a global coupled ocean-atmosphere model starting from the greenhouse gas concentration observed in 1935 , i.e. , at an early time of industrialization . The model wa forced with observed greenhouse gas concentration up to 1985 , and with the equivalent CO2 concentration stipulated in Scenario A ( ''Business a Usual '' ) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change from 1985 to 2085 . The early starting data alleviates some of the cold start problem . The global mean near surface temperature change in 2085 is about 0.3 K ( ca . 10 % ) higher in the early industrialization experiment than in an integration with the same model and identical Scenario A greenhouse gas forcing , but with a start date in 1985 . Comparisons between the experiment with early and late start date show considerable difference in the amplitude of the regional climate change pattern , particularly for sea level . The early industrialization experiment can be used to obtain a first estimate of the detection time for a greenhouse-gas-induced near-surface temperature signal . Detection time estimate are obtained using globally and zonally averaged data from the experiment and a long control run , a well a principal component time series describing the evolution of the dominant signal and noise mode . The latter approach yield the earliest detection time ( in the decade 1990-2000 ) for the time-evolving near-surface temperature signal . For global-mean temperature or for temperature averaged between 45-degrees-N and 45-degrees-S , the signal detection time are in the decade 2015-2025 and 2005-2015 , respectively . The reduction of the ''cold start '' error in the early industrialization experiment make it possible to separate the near-surface temperature signal from the noise about one decade earlier than in the experiment starting in 1985 . We stress that these detection time are only valid in the context of the coupled model 's internally-generated natural variability , which possibly underestimate low frequency fluctuation and doe not incorporate the variance associated with change in external forcing factor , such a anthropogenic sulfate aerosol , solar variability or volcanic dust .

aVThis paper attempt to condense a mass of information relating to economic growth assumption , carbon emission forecast , abatement cost estimate , and global warming damage function and incorporate it into a cost-benefit analysis of slowing climate change , By these mean it is possible to provide evidence on the extent to which society ought to incur control cost now in order to prevent future climate change using the rule commonly associated with project appraisal , In a business a usual scenario , the model predicts a temperature rise of 3.6 degree C above preindustrial level by the end of the next century inflicting damage with a present value of US $ 8.9 trillion , An optimal policy , however , seems to involve an immediate 12.7 % cut in emission and the establishment of 37.1 million hectare of forest , The optimal tax on carbon emission for the year 2000 is estimated to be US $ 16.84 per tonne and the optimal policy reduces temperature rise by 0.3 degree C relative to business a usual , By following the optimal policy , cost are reduced by US $ 700 billion , It is also suggested that policy to halt deforestation and remove the subsidy paid to fossil fuel producer might reduce overall cost by a further US $ 1.1 trillion .

aVThe sensitivity of the equilibrium climate to doubled atmospheric CO2 is investigated using the GENESIS global climate model version 1.02 . The atmospheric general circulation model is a heavily modified version of the NCAR CCM1 and is coupled to a multicanopy land-surface model ( LSX ) ; multilayer model of soil , snow , and sea ice ; and a slab ocean mixed layer . Features that are relatively new in CO2 sensitivity study include explicit subgrid convective plume , PBL mixing a diurnal cycle , a complex land-surface model , sea ice dynamic , and semi-Lagrangian transport of water vapor . The global annual surface-air warming in the model is 2.1 degree C , with global precipitation increasing by 3.3 % . Over mast land area , most of the change in precipitation are insignificant at the 5 % level compared to interannual variability . Decreases in soil moisture in summer are not a large a in most previous model and only occur poleward of similar to 55 degree N in Siberia , northern Canada , and Alaska . Sea ice area in September recedes by 62 % in the Arctic and by 43 % in the Antarctic . The area of Northern Hemispheric permafrost decrease by 48 % , while the the total area of Northern Hemispheric snowcover in January decrease by only 13 % . The effect of several modification to the model physic are described . Replacing LSX and the multilayer soil with a single-layer bucket model cause little change to CO2 sensitivity on global scale , and the region of summer drying in northern high latitude are reproduced , although with somewhat greater amplitude . Compared to convective adjustment , penetrative plume convection increase the tropical Hadley Cell response but decrease the global warming slightly by 0.1 degree to 0.3 degree , contrary to several previous GCM study in which penetrative convection wa associated with greater CO2 warming . Similarly , the use of a cruder parameterization for cloud amount change the local pattern of cloud response but ha slight effect on the global warming . The author discus implication of the greater global warming ( 3.2 degree C ) found in an earlier version of the model and suggest that it wa due to more detailed interaction that no longer occur in the current version .

aVWe have investigated the feasibility of using ab initio molecular orbital method for predicting the global warming potential of the proposed chlorofluorocarbon ( CFC ) substitute CF3CH2F , HFC-134a . Various level of theory and basis set were used to optimize geometry and calculate harmonic vibrational frequency and infrared intensity for the molecule using the GAUSSIAN 92 software package . In attempting to ass the quality of the computation , we found it necessary to reconsider the vibrational assignment available in the literature . We have remeasured the infrared spectrum of the vapor from 400 to 4000 cm ( -1 ) at a resolution ( 0.08 cm ( -1 ) ) sufficient to resolve some overlapping fundamental and to assign symmetry specie unambiguously for several band on the basis of their rotational contour . The higher resolution spectrum and the result of the computation together permit a firm assignment of all 18 fundamental to be made . Some band previously assigned a fundamental are found to be combination or impurity band . On the basis of the current assignment , we find that for the highest level calculation , MP2/6-31G** , the calculated harmonic frequency agree extremely well with the experimentally observed one at frequency below 800 cm ( -1 ) , with a systematic error toward higher calculated frequency becoming apparent above 800 cm ( -1 ) . At lower level of theory , the systematic error is apparent at all frequency . The regularity of the deviation between calculated and observed frequency make ab initio calculation of vibrational frequency much more useful than semiempirical calculation , which tend to show random deviation , a demonstrated with a PM3-UHF calculation in this work . The calculated absolute intensity are in good agreement with the limited experimental measurement previously reported , and the observed relative intensity for the fundamental are also in approximate agreement with our calculated value .

aVBrazil contains the world 's largest expanse of tropical forest , but it forest are experiencing high level of conversion to other us . There is concern that release of CO2 and other greenhouse gas resulting from deforestation will contribute to global climate change , The total amount of C that could be released by deforestation depends upon the amount currently contained in the terrestrial biota and soil . Knowledge of the area of Brazil 's major ecosystem and land use type and their C density wa used to estimate the total amount of C stored in vegetation , litter and coarse woody debris , and soil , The total estimated C pool were ( 58-81 ) X 10 ( 9 ) Mg C in vegetation , ( 6-9 ) X 10 ( 9 ) Mg C in litter and coarse woody debris , and about 72 X 10 ( 9 ) Mg C in soil . Over 80 % of the vegetation pool wa contained in the closed tropical moist forest of Brazil .

aVThe amount of carbon stored in soil and vegetation in Britain , and the potential of forestry to influence , whether soil act a sink or source , are discussed . Soils are estimated to contain c.22 X 10 ( 9 ) t carbon , while the amount in vegetation including forest is only 115 X 10 ( 6 ) t. Some 86 per cent of the soil carbon is present in pear and peaty-surfaced soil , mainly in north-west Britain . Soil carbon content is strongly related to climate and altitude . Conversion of lowland cultivated land to forest can result in carbon accumulation in soil , a it can following the planting of some upland , but quantity appear to be small in relation to the amount carbon released to the atmosphere through fossil fuel use . Forest felling may result in decrease in soil carbon store , due to soil disturbance and change in microclimatic condition , but several decade after reafforestation the carbon store may recover to near original level . Shortening forest rotation may result in long-term decline in soil carbon store . The main concern is the potential for forestry to convert peat , which contain amount of carbon equivalent to 100 year ' fossil fuel use at 1988 level and which are normally slow sink for atmospheric carbon , into carbon source returning it to the atmosphere . The possible impact of forestry and global warming on rate of carbon loss from upland soil including peat are discussed .

aVThe enhancement of the stratospheric aerosol layer caused by the eruption of Mt . Pinatubo ( June 15 , 1991 ) , and the subsequent cooling of the earth 's lower atmosphere [ Dutton and Christy , 1992 ; Minnis et al. , 1993 ] show that stratospheric aerosol can have a strong effect on the earth 's climate . This support the notion that the intentional enhancement of the stratospheric aerosol layer through increased carbonyl sulfide ( OCS ) emission might be an effective mean for counteracting global warming . Through the use of a one-dimensional photochemical model , we investigate what effect such a program might have on global average stratospheric ozone . In addition , we consider the impact of enhanced OCS emission on rainwater acidity and on the overall health of both plant and animal . We find that while the warming produced by a single CO2 doubling ( 1 to 4-degrees-C ) might be offset with ozone loss of le than 5 % , any attempt to use carbonly sulfide a a permanent solution to global warming could result in depletion of global average ozone by 30 % or more . We estimate that in order to achieve cooling of 4-degrees-C rainwater pH would fall to between 3.5 and 3.8 . Finally , a 4-degrees-C cooling at the surface will require that ambient near ground OCS level rise to above 10 ppmv which is probably greater than the safe exposure limit for human . Thus , enhanced OCS emission do not provide an environmentally acceptable solution to the problem of global warming .

aVIn an attempt to contribute to the investigation on a global climate change , a historical series of minimum and maximum temperature data at the Pic du Midi , a mountain observatory at 2862 m a.s.l . in the French Pyrenees , is updated after correction of a systematic deviation due to a relocation of the station in 1971 . These data , which now cover the 1882-1984 period , are examined in parallel with humidity and cloud cover data for the same period . From the beginning to the end of this period , observation show that the mean night-time temperature ha increased by 2.39 degree C/100 yr while the mean daytime temperature ha decreased by 0.50 degree C/100 yr . In consequence , the mean annual diurnal temperature range ha dropped by 36 % /100 yr . The maximum seasonal decrease is 46 % /100 yr in spring , Season-to-season and year-to-year inter-relationships between minimum temperature , maximum temperature , relative humidity and cloud cover suggest that the decrease in maximum temperature is related to a concomitant increase of 15 % /100 yr in both relative humidity and cloud cover .

aVThe montane region ( > 2000 m MSL ) of the Western Ghats in southern India feature stunted evergreen forest ( C3 plant type ) interspersed with extensive grassland ( C3 or C4 plant type ) . We have studied the vegetational history of this ecosystem in relation to climate change during the late Quaternary through stable-carbon isotope analysis of peat deposit a indicator of C3 or C4 plant type . Grasslands ( of C4 type ) were predominant during the last glacial maximum ( 20-18 kyr sp ) and again during 6-3.5 kyr sp , while forest and possibly C3 grassland expanded during the deglaciation , attaining their peak distribution at 10 kyr sp . The shift in C3 and C4 plant type seems related to change in moisture and atmospheric CO2 , with lower moisture and CO2 level favouring the latter plant type . The oscillating climate and vegetation ha influenced the structure and composition of the montane ecosystem . Plant diversity of the near-pristine montane forest is relatively lower than other comparable site in the neotropics . The implication of global change on the tropical montane ecosystem , in particular the composition of the angiosperm and vertebrate community , are discussed . In particular , an expansion of montane forest and replacement of C4 with C3 grassland can be expected . Human impact on the natural vegetation , such a conversion of grassland to monoculture plantation of wattle and eucalypt may , however , interfere with natural succession caused by global climate change . Endemic mammal such a the Nilgiri tahr would face increased risk of extinction .

aVCod Gadus morhua stock on the Labrador Shelf and Grand Banks , NW Atlantic , are apparently at an all-time low . While overfishing ha undoubtedly occurred , it is probable that other factor are affecting stock recruitment a well . Water temperature and salinity are also unusually low , which may have affected the abundance of cod in some way . Northern cod begin spawning in March in most stock management zone around Newfoundland , Canada . First-feeding cod larva survive in water le than 2 degree C but require suitable prey , especially nauplii of the copepod Calanus finmarchicus , to grow well . The 'match/mismatch ' hypothesis assumes that cod spawn at the same time each year , but spawning by copepod may or may not 'match ' depending on the stimulus provided by the 'spring bloom ' of phytoplankton , which can vary with environmental condition by up to 6 wk . While C. finmarchicus is common in the Atlantic water of the Labrador Sea and Grand Banks , zooplankton in the Labrador Current , especially during this period of low temperature and salinity , are dominated by 2 arctic copepod , C , glacialis and C , hyperboreus , which have different spawning season , and therefore probably would not provide a good nutritional match for young cod . Despite global warming , sea water supporting important demersal fish on the continental shelf off northeast Canada is presently colder and fresher than normal . Global warming may have induced melting of glacier and sea ice and increased runoff in river entering the Arctic Ocean and it coastal drainage , reducing salinity at the sea surface , increasing stability and reducing deep convection , and hence upward heat transport . Several cold , fresh 'anomalies ' have been observed in the last few decade and they have contributed to le favourable condition at location around the North Atlantic . These anomaly may be part of an interdecadal climate cycle of alternating warm and cold period , the effect of which must be removed to clearly identify those associated with global warming . Whatever the cause , period of 'ocean cooling ' , with potentially serious consequence for the cod fishery , may be predictable . Increasing amount of ice in the eastern Arctic and Greenland Sea are easily monitored by satellite and appear to anticipate reduced temperature/salinity anomaly in the Labrador Sea by about 4 yr. Climatic impact , whether cyclic or continuing , could be identified sufficiently far in advance to enable modification in management of the fishery toward at least mollifying their effect , thus improving the prospect for long-term sustainability .

aVA large amount of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) is being produced from fossil fuel fired power plant and discharged into the atmosphere annually . As a result , the discharged CO2 is now suspected to have caused the greenhouse effect and global warming problem . To overcome this CO2 emission problem , there is great interest , especially in Canada , to capture carbon dioxide and utilize it a a flooding agent for the enhanced oil recovery ( EOR ) process . In the past few year , a number of feasibility study and a few testing pilot project on CO2 extraction from power plant were performed . However , their result have showed that even though it is technically feasible to extract CO2 from power plant , it cost is high for the EOR application in the current crude petroleum market . A major reason for the high cost is that the CO2 extracting process requires a substantial amount of energy . This paper demonstrates how cogeneration concept together with optimization design strategy would help to reduce the CO2 production cost by utilizing low-pressure steam and waste-heats from various section of the power generation process for extracting CO2 . The economics and technical feasibility of these concept are described and the practical implication given Western Canada 's resource for EOR application are discussed .

aVA short review is presented of progress in climate change scenario development . Sources of uncertainty are discussed . Critical assessment of climate model for their veracity in describing the present climate is considered essential . Methods of deriving sub-continental scale pattern of climate change , per degree of global warming , include the use of finer resolution global model , nested modelling , and spatial interpolation . Transient effect and the importance of extreme event are also discussed .

aVWe are increasingly impressed with the idea that the climate system must be treated globally , and , by the same token , most contaminant affecting the Arctic and it climate have global origin . This is manifestly true of carbon dioxide and it influence on surface temperature through the greenhouse effect , and of chlorofluorocarbon that affect both the surface temperature and stratospheric ozone . In both of these case , the response of the Arctic is more dramatic than that in the lower latitude . Another type of contaminant that affect the Arctic climate in the springtime is the light-absorbing aerosol transported northward from industrial region . Moreover , the Arctic includes several unique regional climatic feedback mechanism , such a the effect that a global warming can have on the release of carbon dioxide and methane locked in the tundra and taiga ( probably a positive feedback ) , and the effect of shrinking sea ice and snowcover on the heat balance of the hemisphere ( definitely a positive feedback ) . It ha long been recognized that change in ocean circulation , notably in the North Atlantic and Greenland Sea , can have a dominant effect on regional and global temperature . All of these effect are unfortunately poorly treated in current climate and ecosystem model , and this introduces an element of uncertainty in prediction of global warming and the fate of contaminant in the Arctic .

aVWith the increasing concern over the threat of ozone depletion and global warming , the rigid polyurethane foam insulation industry is facing a major challenge of selecting alternative for chlorofluorocarbon ( CFCs ) . Under the present situation , however , the effective mean of solving this problem have n't been taken yet . Moreover , with more concern with the saving of energy worldwide , there is hope of insulator with higher performance . This paper report on a micro cellular open cell polyurethane foam , which is very effective a a core material for evacuated insulator . In addition , thermal insulation panel with high performance are developed by utilizing the open cell foam a a core material . The evacuated insulator , so-called ''vacuum insulation panel , '' have an insulation effectiveness four time better than those of the conventional rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate foam ( thermal conductivity is 0.005 W/mK ) and are also very lightweight compared to those made of inorganic substance such a silica powder . The vacuum insulation panel were manufactured by packing the core material and absorbent in a film-like laminated plastic container , which is suitable for holding a vacuum , followed by sealing in the industrial vacuum level ( 0.01 approximately 0.1 mm Hg ) . We have developed the micro cellular ( 100 approximately 200 mum ) and 100 % open cell foam by selecting polyol composition , modified polyisocyanates , surfactant and cell opening additive . The micro cellular open cell foam ha excellent physical property such a heat resistance , compressive strength and low shrinkage a well a non-scorch at the stage of slabstock foaming . These property will be very important for manufacturing the vacuum insulation panel . The open cell foam were blown by using the most conventional and alternative blowing agent in rigid foam system . In the near future , we hope that this open cell foam technology will contribute to the development of environmentally friendly and high performance product in the insulation industry .

aVOn the basis of land station data from the Northern Hemisphere , it wa determined that roughly half of the temporal variance of monthly mean hemispheric mean anomaly in surface air temperature during the period from 1900 through 1990 were linearly related to the amplitude of a distinctive spatial pattern in which the ocean are anomalously cold and the continent are anomalously warm poleward of 40 degree north when the hemisphere is warm . Apart from an upward trend since 1975 , to which El Nino ha contributed , the amplitude time series associated with this pattern resembles seasonally dependent white noise . It is argued that the variability associated with this pattern is dynamically induced and is not necessarily an integral part of the fingerprint of global warming .

aV1 . Growth , appetite , gross conversion efficiency and protein turnover rate of liver , gill and white muscle were measured in juvenile rainbow trout chronically exposed ( 90 day ) to soft and hardwater at two temperature ( ambient , ambient temp . +2 degree C ) . The temperature regime followed that of inshore Lake Ontario over the month of June-September 1993 a temperature rose from similar to 13 to 24 degree C. 2 . Over the initial 60 day of exposure , the addition of 2 degree C to the ambient temperature increased growth , appetite , gross conversion efficiency and protein turnover by an average of 16 % . However , further exposure during the period of peak ambient temperature , led to an average 20 % reduction in growth , appetite , gross conversion efficiency and protein turnover . 3 . Increased rate of gill protein turnover and arguably lower rate of growth indicate that the cost of living for a trout acclimated and maintained in synthetic softwater is higher than that of hardwater fish . In addition , lower appetite in softwater fish suggest that life in softwater is itself a mild form of environmental stress .

aVDuring the last year , several scientist have been concerned with the consequence of global warming . In the Birkenes catchment , situated in southernmost Norway , several warm year have occurred during the last decade . In this climatic region , warm year primarily mean warmer winter with mean air temperature close to or higher than 0 degree C. Small temperature change are therefore decisive for the quality of precipitation , i.e . whether the precipitation enters the catchment a snow or rain , which accordingly ha large consequence for the residence time of water and it pathway through the catchment . Another important effect of higher winter-temperatures at Birkenes , is that stronger and more frequent seasalt episode seem to occur . This may enhance the negative effect to aquatic organism , because the most extreme concentration of acute toxic Al-forms in streamwater are related to seasalt episode during warm winter , when the precipitation come a rain and thus leaf the catchment relatively fast through the uppermost soil layer . When seasalt-enriched water enters into the uppermost soil horizon , a large amount of sodium will be temporarily retained due to cation exchange process , where sodium may substitute for H+ and cationic Al . At Birkenes , but also in similar acidified area with high seasalt input , seasalt episode are probably of greater importance for the periodic variation in streamwater H+ and Al-n+ than commonly recognized . Higher winter-temperatures may also change the timing of the highest streamwater flux of nitrate . This may have local consequence for the primary-production in the fjord , both quantitatively and qualitatively . Thus , global warming may have negative consequence for the surface water chemistry in near-coastal area that also receive high amount of acidifying atmospheric compound , and may change the eutrophication status of many fjord .

aVAtmospheric lifetime are evaluated for the fully fluorinated compound CF4 , C2F6 , c-C4F8 , C6F14 , and SF6 using a two-dimensional transport and chemistry model which includes removal by electron and ion in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere . Laboratory measurement of the pertinent reaction rate were carried out at thermal energy for free electron and for the atmospheric ion O+ , O-2 ( + ) O-2 ( - ) , O-2 ( - ) , NO+ , H3O+ , NO3- , and CO3- . Atmospheric removal by electron reduces the lifetime of c-C4F8 and SF6 from about 3200 year to 1400 and 800 year , respectively , only if the respective product anion C4F8- and SF6- do not subsequently regenerate the parent neutral compound . Atmospheric removal by ion reaction is minor or negligible , with the largest effect ( similar to 5 % ) being removal of C6F14 by O-2 ( + ) . Removal of CF4 and C2F6 by O+ is probably the most important single destruction process in the atmosphere for these two compound , but their lifetime are governed by removal at the Earth 's surface in high-temperature combustors . While we show that the lifetime of c-C4F8 and SF6 may be significantly shorter than previously estimated , these compound remain extremely long-lived with significant global warming potential .

aVEstimates of the relative effect of demographic parameter on population rate of change , and of the level of natural variation in these parameter , are necessary to address potential effect of perturbation on population . We used a stochastic model , based on survival and reproduction estimate of the Porcupine Caribou ( Rangifer tarandus granti ) Herd ( PCH ) , during 1983-89 and 1989-92 to obtain distribution of potential population rate of change ( r ) . The distribution of r produced by 1,000 trajectory of our simulation model ( 1983-89 , rBAR = 0.013 ; 1989-92 , rBAR = 0.003 ) encompassed the rate of increase calculated from an independent series of photo-survey data over the same year ( 1983-89 , r = 0.048 ; 1989-92 , r = -0.035 ) . Changes in adult female survival had the largest effect on r , followed by change in calf survival . We hypothesized that petroleum development on calving ground , or change in calving and post-calving habitat due to global climate change , would affect model input parameter . A decline in annual adult female survival from 0.871 to 0.847 , or a decline in annual calf survival from 0.518 to 0.472 , would be sufficient to cause a declining population , if all other input estimate remained the same . We then used these lower survival rate , in conjunction with our estimated amount of among-year variation , to determine a range of resulting population trajectory . Stochastic model can be used to better understand dynamic of population , optimize sampling investment , and evaluate potential effect of various factor on population growth .

aVThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is implementing a program of SO2 emission allowance trading a part of the Acid Rain Program authorized by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 . Electric utility may use allowance trading a part of their compliance strategy to meet SO2 emission reduction requirement , which begin in 1995 . In the interest of a free market in emission credit , some utility began trading in 1992 . A strict but essential requirement for continuous-emissions monitoring wa developed to support the trading program . This program is being widely watched and will be evaluated a part of an effort to determine if market concept can be successfully extended to other environmental issue . One such issue is greenhouse gas emission and their link with global warming and climate change . This paper focus on the early lesson learned , issue , and challenge involved in going from a domestic electric utility SO2 emission trading program to inter-industry , inter-gas and international a well a national emission trading and offset program . Prominent among these issue are CO2 allowance allocation , equity , emission monitoring , enforcement , and cost-effectiveness .

aVImpacts of global warming on streamflows were estimated for four large watershed in New York State using a daily streamflow model . Three different 100-yr daily weather sequence were input to the model . The first wa produced using statistic of current ( 1961-90 ) weather record . The second and third sequence were based on modification of these historic statistic according to the monthly mean temperature and precipitation change associated with a doubling of atmospheric CO2 a predicted by two different general circulation model . For 2 x CO2 condition , mean annual water balance for all four watershed indicated modest ( 1-9 % ) decrease in precipitation , but much larger ( 16-42 % ) decrease in streamflow due to increase in evapotranspiration . Winter flow generally increased , but flow in the remaining season often decreased . Monthly streamflow change varied considerably among watershed , and we could not attribute these change to specific difference in land us or soil .

aVGlobal climate change is an environmental issue with important strategic ramification for the electric utility industry . Although no mandatory greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emission control program now exist , many utility have decided to participate in voluntary emission reduction and reporting effort under the Department of Energy 's Climate Challenge program and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 . Given uncertainty about possible future regulation and the potentially huge stake of such regulation , utility are increasingly faking GHG emission into account in planning for the future . EPRI is developing a set of decision fool to help utility in this effort . One of these product is a greenhouse gas accounting framework , scheduled for release this year .

aVThere is a consensus of scientific opinion that the activity of man will cause a significant change in the global climate over the next hundred year . The rising level of carbon dioxide and other industrial gas in the atmosphere may lead to global warming with an accompanying rise in sea-level . Mangrove ecosystem grow in the intertidal zone in tropical and sub-tropical region and are likely to be early indicator of the effect of climate change . The best estimate of predicted climate change in the literature are presented . It is suggested that a rise in mean sea-level may be the most important factor influencing the future distribution of mangrove but that the effect will vary dramatically depending on the local rate of sea-level rise and the availability of sediment to support reestablishment of the mangrove . The predicted rise in mean air temperature will probably be of little consequence to the development of mangrove in general but it may mean that the presence of mangrove will move further north and south , though this will depend on a number of additional factor . The effect of enhanced atmospheric CO2 on the growth of mangrove is unknown at this time but that there is some evidence that not all specie of mangrove will respond similarly . The socio-economic impact of the effect of climate change on mangrove ecosystem may include increased risk of flooding , increased erosion of coast line , saline intrusion and increased storm surge .

aVA stochastic space-time model is used at four location in Greece for estimating the effect of global climate change on daily temperature and precipitation . The approach is based on a semi-empirical downscaling of simulated daily atmospheric Circulation Patterns ( CP ) of General Circulation Models ( GCM ) . Historical data and a 10-year output of the Max Planck Institute GCM for the 1 x CO2 and 2 x CO2 case are used . Nine CP type for the winter and summer half year are obtained to characteriz ; e large-scale climatic forcing in Greece . Local temperature and precipitation appear to be highly dependent on CP type . The space-time response of daily temperature to global climate change is slightly variable in Greece . In general , a warmer climate will imply nearly 3 degree C increase in fall and in winter . The variability within the month will not change considerably . A slight but statistically significant increase of precipitation is obtained at one location and an insignificant increase is found at the other three location .

aVThe question is considered about impact of tropical cyclone ( TC ) , one of the most intensive atmospheric phenomenon , on the ozone layer . By generalizing the data obtained for last year three mechanism of the impact are analyzed and their possible effect are evaluated . It is shown that observed positive and negative anomaly in total ozone content ( TOC ) in TC zone are due to dynamical and electrochemical mechanism . The estimate of their spatial and temporal scale are obtained . Specific feature of TOC variation at the stage of developing depression can be considered a an indication of it transformation in a storm while periodic oscillation of TOC under the action of gravity wave generated by TC - a an indicator of dynamic of TC . In relation to the global warming effect it is noted that one should expect increasing in the number and magnitude of negative anomaly of TOC caused by TC . This can be treated a a hazard factor at a background of minimum value of TOC in region of action of TC .

aVAccurate prediction of specie change in lake ecosystem following biomanipulation measure is of paramount importance in view of water quality management . The temporal variation of phytoplankton biomass a chlorophyll-a and transparency a Secchi depth measurement are studied in the Lake Bleiswijkse Zoom , The Netherlands , with a comprehensive structural dynamic model . In the formulation of the biological model , phytoplankton a several specie , zooplankton , detritus , planktivores and benthivores , and piscivores are considered to be major contributing state variable for the model . The primary goal of this paper is to describe the possible impact of several environmental scenario on chlorophyll-a biomass qualitatively a it would help lake and environmental manager and relevant authority elucidate the process of eutrophication and biomanipulation in a broad way . Some of the scenario that have been studied by this model are : ( 1 ) The effect of fixed stoichiometry in term of internal nitrogen and phosphorus that are tied up within algal cell ; ( 2 ) the effect of external phosphorus limitation ; ( 3 ) light limitation and external nitrogen limitation on algal growth ; ( 4 ) probable consequence that have taken place within the chlorophyll-a biomass due to change in biomass of various aquatic organism ; and ( 5 ) possible change of chlorophyll-a biomass due to higher temperature caused by global warming .

aVWater , nitrogen , and water-plus-nitrogen at level beyond the range normally experienced by shortgrass steppe community were applied from 1971 through 1975 , plant population were sampled through 1977 , and the result of the experiment were published . Upon revisiting the plot in 1982 , we found it apparent that large change had occurred since 1977 . Sampling wa re-established in 1982 to follow trajectory of recovery . Our purpose in this paper are to examine how conclusion from this study changed through time , and discus implication of these change for monitoring potentially stressed ecosystem . Although productivity increased , dissimilarity in plant specie composition at the end of the 5 yr of nutrient treatment were not significantly different from control . Two year after cessation of the treatment exotic ''weed '' specie were increasing in water-plus-nitrogen treated community , and community dissimilarity were diverging in water and water-plus-nitrogen treated community . Seven year after cessation of treatment all community were significantly different from control . Exotics were more than ten time more abundant in water-plus-nitrogen and nitrogen treated community than they had been 2 yr post-treatment . A consistent trend in recovery of all treated community wa evident over the next 5 yr . However , the trend towards recovery reversed over the next four consecutive year in the previously water-plus-nitrogen and water treated community . The four-to-five year cycle in specie composition and abundance of exotics towards , and then away from , condition in undisturbed control community were not related to weather but large accumulation of litter suggested biotic regulation . Inertia of existing plant population , or the tendency to continue to occupy a site when condition become unfavorable , can mask both future deterioration in ecosystem condition and unstable behavior resulting from environmental stressor . Time lag in initial response mean that an ecosystem can pas a threshold leading to transition to alternate state before it is evident in structural characteristic such a specie composition . Global climate change and sulfur and nitrogen oxide pollutant also have the potential to act a enrichment-stressors with initial time lag and/or positive effect and cumulative , subsequent negative effect , rather than a disturbance force with immediate negative impact . Sociopolitical system , however , often require change in biological variable or negative impact before acting to ameliorate environmental problem . The manner in which conclusion changed at various period in time , and the potential for time lag in response of specie population , raise question about which variable are most useful for detection of stress and how long study must last to be useful .

aVThe structure of landscape subject to patch-forming catastrophic disturbance , or ''disturbance landscape '' , is controlled by the characteristic of the disturbance regime , including the distribution of disturbance size and interval , and the rotation time . The primary landscape structure in disturbance landscape is the structure of the mosaic of disturbance patch , which can be described by index such a patch size and shape . The purpose of this research wa to use a geographical information system-based spatial model ( DISPATCH ) to simulate the effect of the initial density of patch on the rate of response to alteration of a disturbance regime , the effect of global warming and cooling , and the effect of fragmentation and restoration , on the structure of a generalized temperate-zone forested disturbance landscape over a period of 400 yr . The simulation suggest that landscape require 1/2 to 2 rotation of a new disturbance regime to adjust to that regime regardless of the size and interval distribution . Thus alteration that shorten rotation , a would be the case if global warming increase fire size and decrease fire interval , produce a more rapid response than do alteration that lengthen rotation , such a cooling and fire suppression . Landscape with long rotation may be in perpetual disequilibrium with their disturbance regime due to a mismatch between their adjustment rate and the rate of climatic change . Landscapes with similar rotation time may have different structure , because size and interval distribution independently affect landscape structure . The response of disturbance landscape to changing disturbance regime is governed by both the number and size of patch birth .

Results presented were obtained for plant grown in silt loam soil under well-watered condition . Grain yield increase in response to elevated CO2 in the absence of O-3 stress averaged 9.0 , 12.0 , and 1.0 % for soybean , wheat , and corn : respectively . Reductions in grain yield in response to the elevated O-3 treatment at 350 mu mol CO2 mol ( -1 ) averaged 20.0 , 29.0 and 13.0 % for soybean , wheat , and corn , respectively . Reductions in grain yield in response to elevated O-3 at 500 mu mol CO2 mol ( -1 ) averaged 20.0 , 8.0 , and 7.0 % for soybean , wheat , and corn , respectively . Dry biomass and harvest index in wheat were significantly reduced by O-3 stress at 350 mu mol mol ( -1 ) CO2 but not at 500 u mol mol ( -1 ) CO2 . Seed weight 1000 ( -1 ) for soybean and wheat wa significantly increased by CO2 enrichment and decreased by O-3 stress . Seed weight 1000 ( -1 ) in corn wa increased by O-3 stress suggesting that O-3 affected pollination resulting in fewer kernel per ear .

aVIn Asia , rice production ha increased an average 2.7 % annually - due to greater fertilizer use and crop intensification together with varietal improvement and investment in irrigation facility . Nitrogen efficiency in tropical rice is low . N-15 recovery rarely exceeds 30-40 % in wetland rice production system . Ammonia ( NH3 ) volatilization and denitrification are recognized a major nitrogen loss mechanism in such system . Information on the relative importance of the two loss process is available for few site in Asia . The greatest loss of N are reported to occur when the fertilizer treatment lead to a high concentration of ammoniacal N in the floodwater . Results from the study using micrometereological technique suggest that ammonia volatilization may be the most important loss process in wetland rice ecosystem . Directly measuring denitrification in the held proved more difficult than measuring NH3 volatilization due to difficulty in distinguishing the main end product of denitrification ( N-2 ) against a large background of atmospheric N-2 . However , the directly measured ( N-2 + N2O ) - N-15 flux for rice in Indonesia , Thailand and the Philippines rice field wa le than 1 % of the applied N. Green manure incorporation in wetland rice field reduced N loss from mineral N source due to resulting lower floodwater pH and lower partial pressure of NH3 ( pNH ( 3 ) ) than that of urea applied alone . At present , the integrated use of green manure and mineral N is receiving much attention in the hope of meeting farmer ' desire to reduce cost of production a well a ecological consideration such a increased methane production which contribute to global climate change . Other promising alternative practice for increasing fertilizer N efficiency include improved timing and application method , particularly through better incorporation of basal N fertilizer without standing water , deep placement , and use of coated fertilizer .

aVThis paper aim to demonstrate the advantage of a sequential approach to decision making in climate policy , This sequential approach is necessary because of the uncertainty regarding both the avoided cost of climate change and the cost of GHG emission abatement , This assessment focus on the minimization of learning time , the reduction of technical and institutional inertia , and the possible unexpected non-linearities in abatement curve . A stylized representation of so-called 'no-regret ' short-term potential , of long-term innovation trend and of backstop technology is used , We show that if we do take care of the inertia constraint in the decision process , both policy ( namely the no-regret and the innovation process exploitation ) becomes crucial in term of minimization of the learning time .

aVIn this paper , we present a new specification of warming cost and incorporate it into an integrated assessment model of global climate change . In the new specification , warming cost is represented a the product of possible large warming related welfare loss which occur with small probability that depend on the amount of temperature rise . This is in contrast to the conventional representation of warming cost a a deterministic function of temperature rise . To avoid 'curse of dimensionality ' problem , we assume that loss affect the utility of consumption without directly affecting consumption itself , and that the probability of loss occurring is independent of the number of loss that may have previously occurred . The result we obtain using this new approach depend importantly on the specification of the loss probability function . Nevertheless , our result are qualitatively similar to previous result obtained using a deterministic specification of warming cost , in which cost is a cubic function of temperature rise .

aVOrganic carbon eroded and oxidized from marine sediment on the passive and active neo-Tethyan margin during the early Indian-Asian collision may have been sufficient to shift the carbon isotopic ratio of late Paleocene-early Eocene marine carbonate toward lighter value , and may have contributed to coeval global warming via the greenhouse effect . New limit on the timing of collision and the organic carbon content of Himalayan sedimentary source and sink allow u to estimate the net Paleogene flux . Our calculation suggest that continental collision play a fundamental role in the global carbon cycle and climate through the exhumation a well a burial of organic carbon .

aVThe photosynthetic performance of a helical tubular photobioreactor ( ''Biocoil '' ) , incorporating the filamentous cyanobacterium Spirulina platensis , wa investigated . The photobioreactor wa constructed in a cylindrical shape ( 0.9 m high ) with a 0.25-m ( 2 ) basal area and a photostage comprising 60 m of transparent PVC tubing of 1.6-cm inner diameter ( volume = 12.1 L ) . The inner surface of the cylinder ( area = 1.32 m ( 2 ) ) wa illuminated with cool white fluorescent lamp ; the energy input of photosynthetically active radiation ( PAR , 400 to 700 nm ) into the photobioreactor wa 2920 kJ per day . An air-lift system incorporating 4 % CO2 wa used to circulate the growth medium in the tubing . The maximum productivity achieved in batch culture wa 7.18 g dry biomass per day [ 0.51 g.d biomass/L.day , or 5.44 g.d biomass/m ( 2 ) ( inner surface of cylindrical shape ) /day ] which corresponded to a photosynthetic ( PAR ) efficiency of 5.45 % . The CO2 wa efficiently removed from the gaseous stream ; monitoring the CO2 in the outlet and inlet gas stream showed a 70 % removal of CO2 from the inlet gas over an 8-h period with almost maximum growth rate .

aVThe biological activity and geographic distribution of the malarial parasite and it vector are sensitive to climatic influence , especially temperature and precipitation . We have incorporated Genera Circulation Model-based scenario of anthropogenic global climate change in an integrated linked-system model for predicting change in malaria epidemic potential in the next century . The concept of the disability-adjusted life year is included to arrive at a single measure of the effect of anthropogenic climate change on the heath impact of malaria Assessment of the potential impact of global climate change on the incidence of malaria suggests a widespread increase of risk due to expansion of the area suitable for malaria transmission . This predicted increase is most pronounced at the border of endemic malaria area and at higher altitude within malarial area . The incidence of infection is sensitive to climate change in area of Southeast Asia , South America , and part of Africa where the disease is le endemic ; in these region the number of year of healthy life lost may increase significantly . However , the simulated change in malaria risk must be interpreted on the basis of local environmental condition , the effect of socioeconomic development , and malaria control program or capability .

aVThe area under agricultural production in southern Africa is declining a a result of industrial expansion , mining a well a formal and informal urbanization . Simultaneously , the increasing demand for timber product will necessitate a doubling of the present area under commercial afforestation in South Africa over the next 30 year . Potentially afforestable area , however , frequently occur in the same climatic belt a certain subtropical fruit crop . Given the climatic constraint for optimum growth of commercially afforestable timber specie and subtropical horticultural crop , that southern Africa is a largely semi-arid region , the fact that the areal extent of land available for agriculture is shrinking , together with the uncertainty and possible threat linked with anticipated global climate change , the identification of land area suitable for future expansion of plantation and subtropical crop requires careful assessment . The spatial distribution of area suited climatically to optimum growth of two commercial tree specie , Eucalyptus grandis and Pinus patula , and two subtropical crop , avocado and pecan nut , were mapped for southern Africa using a climate threshold approach in conjunction with detailed gridded climate information base , for both the present climate and for a possible future climate scenario . Results indicate that the possible impact of a future temperature-increase on the spatial distribution of optimum growth area is specie dependent , favouring E. grandis , avocado and pecan nut , but not P. patula . According to the climatic threshold model used , the timber specie and horticultural crop considered produced a westward shift to 'new ' climatically suitable area in the future . The result also indicate that climate change resulting from the augmented greenhouse effect may benefit the horticultural industry to a greater extent than the timber industry . Hence , competition for land suitable for future expansion of certain commercial tree specie and subtropical crop may become an important consideration in the future .

aVThe significance of terrestrial ecosystem to global climate change will not be fully recognized until all component which contribute to their flux are accurately quantified . The absence of a common approach to quantify terrestrial carbon ha resulted in substantial discrepancy in regional , national , and global estimate of carbon . One of the most dramatic case is represented by the flux estimate for Russian forest which differ both in character and by two order of magnitude . A system of accounting which provides a comprehensive estimate of the carbon flux between Russian forest and the atmosphere is presented herein . All significant component of the carbon cycle in forest ecosystem are considered . The sequestration of carbon in Russian forest is substantial , In the late 1980s and early 1990s , Russian forest were accumulating 0.66 Pg C yr ( -1 ) . Approximately one-third of the sequestered carbon wa returned to the atmosphere through logging and forest fire .

aVThe Asian Pacific Integrated Model ( AIM ) is a large-scale model for scenario analysis of greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emission and the impact of global warming in the Asian Pacific region , The AIM comprises two main model - the AIM/emission model for predicting GHG emission and the AIM/impact model for estimating the impact of global warming - which are linked by the global GHG cycle and the climate change model , This paper categorizes the scenario that have been written so far in relation to global warming , and then , given fixed input , simulates the effect of global warming taking into account various uncertainty , Several recent outcome from the AIM/impact model are then described , Assuming climate change scenario deduced from AIM/emission and GCM experiment , primary impact on water resource and natural vegetation are assessed .

aVWe assessed the potential effect of increased temperature and change in amount and seasonal timing of precipitation on the hydrology and vegetation of a semi-permanent prairie wetland in North Dakota using a spatially-defined , rule-based simulation model . Simulations were run with increased temperature of 2 degree C combined with a 10 percent increase or decrease in total growing season precipitation . Changes in precipitation were applied either evenly across all month or to individual season ( spring , summer , or fall ) . The response of semi-permanent wetland P1 wa relatively similar under most of the seasonal scenario . A 10 percent increase in total growing season precipitation applied to summer month only , to fall month only , and over all month produced lower water level compared to those resulting from the current climate due to increased evapotranspiration . Wetland hydrology wa most affected by change in spring precipitation and runoff . Vegetation response wa relatively consistent across scenario . Seven of the eight seasonal scenario produced drier condition with no open water and greater vegetation cover compared to those resulting from the current climate . Only when spring precipitation increased did the wetland maintain an extensive open water area ( 49 percent ) . Potential change in climate that affect spring runoff , such a change to spring precipitation and snow melt , may have the greatest impact on prairie wetland hydrology and vegetation . In addition , relatively small change in water level during dry year may affect the period of time the wetland contains open water . Emergent vegetation , once it is established , can survive under drier condition due to it ability to persist in shallow water with fluctuating level . The model 's sensitivity to change in temperature and seasonal precipitation pattern accentuates the need for accurate regional climate change projection from general circulation model .

aVWe investigated the effect of global climate change and doubled atmospheric CO2 concentration to plant primary production and soil organic matter of typical steppe ( Leymus chinense steppe and Stipa grandis steppe ) and meadow steppe ( Filifolium sibiricum steppe , S. baicalensis steppe and L. chinense steppe ) at individual site in Inner Mongolia , using the CENTURY ecosystem model . In the simulation of climate change , loss of soil organic C range from 783 gC.m ( -2 ) in meadow steppe to 1485 gC.m ( -2 ) in typical steppe , and annual above-ground net primary production ( ANPP ) decrease by 17.6 gC.m ( -2 ) in meadow steppe to 29.5 gC.m ( -2 ) in typical steppe under CCC ( Canadian Climate Center ) . While under GFDL ( Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory ) , loss of soil organic C varies from 584 gC.m ( -2 ) in typical steppe to 1164 gC.m ( -2 ) in meadow steppe , and ANPP decrease in the range of 18.3 gC.m ( -2 ) in typical steppe to 32.1 gC.m ( -2 ) in meadow steppe . In the simulation of climate change plus elevated CO2 ( from 350 p.p.m . to 700 p.p.m . ) , ANPP decrease by 5.4 gC.m ( -2 ) in meadow steppe to 11.3 gC.m ( -2 ) in typical steppe under CCC + CO2 , while ANPP varies from an increase of 1.8 gC.m ( -2 ) in S. grrmdis steppe to a decrease of 20.6 gC.m ( -2 ) in meadow steppe under GFDL + CO2 . Losses of soil organic C are slightly lower ( in the range of 42 gC.m ( -2 ) to 248 gC.m ( -2 ) ) than loss of soil organic C under climate change only . These five steppe ecosystem are very sensitive to climate change , dependent upon projected change in temperature and precipitation by GCMs of CCC and GFDL .

aVOne effect of global warming may be an increase in night-time temperature with daytime temperature remaining largely unchanged . We examined this potential effect of global warming on the performance of tobacco hornworm larva , Manduca sexta ( Sphingidae ) , by manipulating night-time temperature and dietary rutin level simultaneously under a 12 light:12 dark photoregime . All four thermal regime ( 26:14 , 26:18 , 26:22 , and 26:26 degree C ) had a daytime temperature of 26 degree C , with the night-time temperature increased from 14 to 26 degree C by increment of 4 degree C. Dietary rutin level ( 0 , 10 and 20 mu-moles g ( -1 ) fresh weight of diet ) reflected those occurring naturally in the leaf of tomato , a preferred host plant of M. sexta . With low night-time temperature ( 14 and 18 degree C ) , rutin had a negative linear effect on developmental rate , relative growth rate and relative consumption rate of the caterpillar . However , at a night-time temperature of 22 degree C , rutin had a negative non-linear effect . At a night-time temperature of 26 degree C , rutin had a negative linear impact but le so than at the other nighttime temperature . Likewise , the negative effect of rutin on molting duration wa mitigated a night-time temperature increased . Final larval weight decreased linearly with increased dietary rutin concentration . Total amount of food ingested wa not affected by either rutin or thermal regime . As expected , the caterpillar developed faster under an alternating 26:14 degree C regime than a constant 20 degree C regime ( the average temperature for the alternating regime ) , but the effect of rutin depended on the thermal regime . Switching daytime and night-time temperature had no statistically significant effect on caterpillar performance . Overall , the effect of rutin on rate of larval performance wa greater at some level of warmer night but damped at another level . These result indicate that the potential effect of warmer night on insect performance is not a simple function of temperature because there can be interaction between night-time temperature and dietary allelochemicals .

aVEvents in 1988 helped focus the attention of several state on the global climate change issue . Consequently , the National Governors ' Association conducted an assessment in 1989 and recommended various action . By 1994 , 22 state have enacted law or regulation and/or established research program addressing climate change . Most of these ''no regret '' action are set up to conserve energy or improve energy efficiency and also to reduce greenhouse gas emission . Illinois ha adopted an even broader program by 1 ) establishing a Global Climate Change Office to foster research and provide information and 2 ) forming a task force to address a wide array of issue including state input to federal policy such a the Clinton administration 's 1993 Climate Change Action Plan and to the research dimension of the U.S . Global Climate Change Research Program . The Illinois program call for increased attention to study of regional impact , including integrated assessment , and to research addressing mean to adapt to future climate change . These various state effort to date help show the direction of policy development and should be useful to those grappling with these issue .

aVThe tropical rainforest of Indonesia are threatened with deforestation caused by rapid economic development . Because this development hastens global warming and reduces biodiversity , it violates the doctrine of sustainable development . The Brundtland report , Our Common Future ( Brundtland , 1987 ) , defined sustainable development a 'development that meet the need of the present , without compromising the ability of future generation to meet their own need ' . Sustainable development wa adopted a the overarching world development policy of the 21st century at the Earth Summit in 1992 , which introduced international accord to integrate economic development and environmental protection , manage and conserve the world 's forest , stabilize production of the gas that cause global warming , and conserve the variety of living specie . Indonesia view sustainable development with suspicion and is committed to economic development on the Western model . Sustainable development advocate , however , seek to save the Indonesian rainforest because they amount to 10 % of those remaining in the world . They fear that the destruction of Indonesia 's rainforest will , by hastening global warming , burden future generation with such problem a coastal flooding , migration of agricultural region and habitat loss and , by reducing biodiversity , deprive them of the opportunity to study specie and use them to improve the human condition . The conservation of the tropical rainforest of Indonesia may depend on the rediscovery of it indigenous natural resource system , which are tantamount to a regime of environmental law and policy . These system include the water temple system of Ball , the home-garden system of Java , the adat and sasi system of Nusa Tenggara and Maluku , the land-tenure system of West Kalimantan , the shifting cultivation system of East Kalimantan , and the traditional non-timber production system of forest dweller . These system , which are characterized by permaculture , biodiversity conservation , property right , and sustained yield , prevent Hardin 's 'tragedy of the common ' ( Hardin , 1968 ) , and foster Leopold 's 'biotic integrity ' ( Leopold , 1968 ) . As a paradigm of land use governance , such system have sustained the economy and environment of Indonesia on behalf of it people for millennium . It is concluded that the indigenous natural resource system of Indonesia have a vital role to play in it sustainable development .

aVThermal power plant located in Japan , burning coal , petroleum , LNG or methanol , were analyzed here from the viewpoint of the energy balance and the overall CO2 emission , including the emission from the fuel treatment stage such a the mining of fossil fuel , transportation , and the post-combustion stage such a CO2 removal and storage . The reduction of the net CO2 emission by CO2 removal and storage is the largest for the coal fired plant of others , but the decrease in the energy efficiency is also the largest . This result suggests that if there is not any problem for supplying coal , CO2 removal and storage should be equipped on the coal fired plant to mitigate the global warming .

Water can drain from the surface of the lake , or from lower in the water column and the physico-chemical , and biotic , characteristic of these two type of lake outlet are very different during lake stratification . 2 . Temperature will have effect on the lake water and on the lake-outlet community . The effect of temperature on the surface water of the lake will be of special importance since this is the region where the influence of solar radiation is at it highest . Warming of the surface water of lake will have many direct , and indirect effect , on the lake-outlet community . 3 . Increasing temperature above level currently found will have both advantage , and disadvantage for component of the lake-outlet community .

aVGlobal climate change may impact the cycling of C , N , and S in forest ecosystem because increased soil temperature could alter rate of microbially mediated process . We studied the effect of temperature on microbial respiration and net N and S mineralization in surface soil from four northern hardwood forest in the Great Lakes region . Soil sample were incubated in the laboratory at five temperature ( 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , and 25 degree C ) for 32 wk . Headspace gas wa analyzed for CO2-C at 2-wk interval , and soil were extracted to determine inorganic N and S. Cumulative respired C and mineralized N and S increased with temperature at all site and were strongly related ( r ( 2 ) = 0.67 to 0.90 , significant at P = 0.001 ) to an interaction between temperature and soil organic C. Production of respired C and mineralized N wa closely fit by first-order kinetic model ( r ( 2 ) greater than or equal to 0.94 , P = 0.001 ) , whereas mineralized S wa best described by zero-order kinetics . Contrary to common assumption , rate constant estimated from the first-order model were not consistently related to temperature , but apparent pool size of C and N were highly temperature dependent . Temperature effect on microbial respiration could not be accurately predicted using temperature-adjusted rate constant combined with a constant pool size of labile C. Results suggest that rate of microbial respiration and the mineralization of N and S may be related to a temperature-dependent constraint on microbial access to substrate pool . Simulation model should rely on a thorough understanding of the biological basis underlying microbially mediated C , N , and S transformation in soil .

aVFluxes of trace gas from northern ecosystem represent a highly uncertain and potentially significant component of the arctic land-atmosphere system , especially in the context of greenhouse-induced climate change . The initial goal of the Arctic Flux Study ( a part of NSF 's Arctic System Science Program ) is a regional estimate of the present and future movement of material between the land , atmosphere and ocean in the Kuparuk River basin in northern Alaska . We are measuring rate and control of process along a north-south transect running from the marshy coastal plain to mountain valley . Important vertical flux under study are the release of CO2 and CH4 from soil and water , lateral flux are surface water , nutrient , and organic matter . A hierarchy of measurement allow the rate and understanding of process to be scaled from plot to the landscape , regional , and circumarctic level . These include gas flux measurement in small chamber , measurement over larger area by eddy correlation from small tower , and measurement at the landscape scale from airplane overflight . Experimental manipulation of carbon dioxide , soil moisture , nutrient and soil temperature from this and other study give information on process control . The distribution of plant community ha been described at several landscape-scale site and a hierarchic GIS ha been developed for the region at three scale ( plot , landscape , region ) . Climate is measured at six site and hydrological process are being studied at each watershed scale . In the soil , measurement are being made of soil organic matter and active layer thickness and of availability of soil organic matter for microbial transformation into CO2 and CH4 . Fluxes and process understanding have been incorporated into a hierarchy of model at different scale . These include model of regional climate nested in a GCM ; of regional- and continental-scale plant productivity and carbon cycling including CO2 release under altered climate ; watershed and regional model of hydrology ; and surface energy budget . After the first year of study the regional climate model ha been successfully configured to the northern Alaska region We have also measured a large release of carbon dioxide from tundra soil in all but the coldest and wettest part of the transect . The rate from eddy correlation tower ( landscape level ) agree closely with rate from chamber ( plot level ) . Observations , experimental manipulation and modelling analysis result in the prediction that the combination of warmer and drier soil is responsible for the large CO2 release .

aVThe urban warming effect is interesting in it own right and is important for understanding global warming . The aim of this study is to determine how the urban warming effect change with cloud condition and with wind speed . Studies of the urban warming effect have mostly concentrated on the urban-rural difference in daily maximum or minimum temperature . The problem wa approached using a new technique . Instead of comparing a city , represented by a first-order weather station , with the surrounding rural area , represented by data collected by cooperative observer ; pair of city , each with a first-order weather station , were studied . One city wa large . The other city wa small enough to have a minimal warming effect and wa close enough to the larger city to approximately represent the rural area . In this way , hourly temperature , cloud cover , and wind data could be studied rather than only the difference between the daily maximum or minimum . Results show that wind disrupts the normal nocturnal cooling pattern in which the smaller city , with lower thermal inertia , cool more quickly than the larger city . Clouds also disrupt this pattern , at least to the extent that one must be careful about extrapolating either magnitude or pattern of urban-rural temperature difference observed by satellite under clear sky condition to partly cloudy or cloudy condition .

aVThe subject of this paper is part of a wider investigation into the engineering implication of the predicted sea-level rise a a result of climate change on a typical maritime local authority ( MLA ) using the Borough of Gosport in Hampshire a a detailed case study . The paper describes the analysis of the drainage system of three catchment area , each with different surface characteristic , within the Borough of Gosport . The performance of each system is examined under a combination of three possible sea-level rise scenario and two possible storm condition . The result give cause for concern and have to be taken seriously ; it is proposed that effect of rising sea level , due to global warming , should be taken into account in current design work . It is proposed that a new assessment procedure 'climatic impact assessment ' becomes a compulsory requirement for all scheme that might be sensitive to the effect of climate change . Many professional engineer still do not consider that global warming effect will take place . However , this paper confirms that the concern being expressed regarding the effect of climate change have to be taken seriously . It is likely that every MLA will be affected by these change , and the cost implication of this are very significant . There is a serious lack of systematic data collection for assessment of the possible impact .

aVThis paper concern the impact of human-induced global climate change on the River Rhine discharge . For this purpose a model for climate assessment , named ESCAPE , is coupled to a water balance model , named RHINEFLOW . From climate scenario , change in regional annual water availability and seasonal discharge in the River Rhine Basin are estimated . The climate scenario are based on greenhouse gas emission scenario . An assessment is made for ''best guess '' seasonal discharge change and for change in frequency of low and high discharge in the downstream reach of the river . In addition , a quantitative estimation of the uncertainty associated with this guess is arrived at . The result show that the extent and range of uncertainty is large with respect to the ''best guess '' change . The uncertainty range is 2-3 time larger for the Business-as-Usual than for the Accelerated Policies scenario . This large range stem from the doubtful precipitation simulation from the present General Circulation Models . This scenario study showed the precipitation scenario to be the key-elements within the present range of reliable climate change scenario . For the River Rhine ''best guess '' change for annual water availability are small according to both scenario . The river change from a present combined snow-melt-rain fed river to an almost entirely rain fed river . The difference between present-day large average discharge in winter and the small average discharge in autumn should increase for all scenario . This trend is largest in the Alpine part of the basin . Here , winter discharge should increase even for scenario forecasting annual precipitation decrease . Summer discharge should decrease . ''Best guess '' scenario should lead to increased frequency of both low and high flow event in the downstream ( Dutch ) part of the river . The result indicate change could be larger than presently assumed in ''worst case scenario '' used by the Dutch water management authority .

This index is then applied to result of a simulation of the effect of global warming on the productivity of cow-calf range livestock system in the western USA . Estimates of declining range-based income in a southern tier of state coupled with increasing productivity in the middle and northern Great Plains , the inter-mountain Rockies and the Pacific Northwest suggest that significant shift could occur in the location of feeder calf production if these climate change occur .

aVAs a first step in investigating the effect of sea ice change on the climate sensitivity to doubled atmospheric CO2 , the author use a standard simple sea ice model while varying the sea ice distribution and thickness in the control run . Thinner ice amplifies the atmospheric temperature sensitivity in these experiment by about 15 % ( to a warming of 4.8 degree C ) , because it is easier for the thinner ice to be removed a the climate warms . Thus , it impact on sensitivity is similar to that of greater sea ice extent in the control run , which provides more opportunity for sea ice reduction . An experiment with sea ice not allowed to change between the control and doubled CO2 simulation illustrates that the total effect of sea ice on surface air temperature change , including cloud cover and water vapor feedback that arise in response to sea ice variation , amount to 37 % of the temperature sensitivity to the CO2 doubling , accounting for 1.56 degree C of the 4.17 degree C global warming . This is about four time larger than the sea ice impact when no feedback are allowed . The different experiment produce a range of result for southern high latitude with the hydrologic budget over Antarctica implying sea level increase of varying magnitude or no change . These result highlight the importance of properly constraining the sea ice response to climate perturbation , necessitating the use of more realistic sea ice and ocean model .

aVUnderstanding the : role the ocean play in sequestering anthropogenic CO2 is crucial to understanding global climate change . Correct parameterization of air-sea flux of CO2 is an important challenge to modeler . Recently it ha been demonstrated that the thin thermal layer at the surface of the ocean can lead to an underestimate of CO2 solubility ( Robertson and Watson , 1992 ) We re-evaluate the effect of the cool thermal skin anti present a high-resolution seasonal estimate of it effect on the air-sea , flux of CO2 . We . compare air-sea flux estimate derived using both a mean wind field and a more realistic Rayleigh distribution of the wind field . Using the mean monthly wind stress and a linear relationship between wind speed and the gas exchange coefficient of CO2 ( Tans et al. , 1990 ) , we estimate that excluding the southern ocean , the surface . skin correction increase the air-sea flux of carbon by 0.48 Ct yr ( -1 ) . This is 25 % lower than the correction suggested by Robertson and Watson ( 1992 ) and the difference is attributed to the better temporal and spatial resolution of the present data set . When a more realistic representation of the temporally varying wind is used , the corrected carbon flux decrease to 0.36 Ct yr ( -1 ) Conservatively , adding a . 10 % contribution fi om the southern ocean , we estimate a mean global increase . in CO2 flux clue to the skin effect of 0.39 Ct C yr ( -1 ) This is 40 % lower than the previous estimate of Robertson and Watson ( 1992 ) . Finally , adopting the gas transfer parameterization of Liss and Merlivat ( 1984 ) , we estimate a CO2 flux anomaly of only 0.17 Gt C yr ( -1 ) which is approximately 50 % lower than the analogous estimate using the Tans et al . ( 1990 ) formulation and a full 75 % lower than the estimate of Robertson Watson ( 1992 ) . These result suggest that both a proper representation of the wind speed/flux correlation and a realistic distribution of the wind field is essential in making large-settle flux estimate . We also examine the seasonal variation of the thermal skin effect . The largest negative temperature gradient ( -0.75 degree C ) are found during the northern hemisphere winter in the region of the . Kuroshio and the Gulf Stream Currents , whereas the central North Pacific ha a small positive temperature gradient during the summer month .

aVThe deforestation and degradation of tropical forest are taking place at an extremely rapid pace . According to the Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) , the estimated annual rate of tropical deforestation during the 1981-1985 period wa 113 846 square kilometer or 0.6 % of the 1981 total forested area . The implication of the loss of these forest are staggering ( Myers , N. , 1989 . Deforestation Rates in Tropical Forests and Their Climatic Implications . Friends of the Earth , London ) . Tropical forest are extremely rich ecosystem which support a disproportionately large share of the world 's plant and animal specie . Forests play a crucial role in both nutrient and hydrological cycling and may provide sustainable economic benefit through managed harvesting of timber and the collection of non-timber product such a fruit , nut , and rubber . Also , deforestation is a significant source of global warming through it effect on the global carbon cycle . This paper focus on the relationship between debt and deforestation , examining conceptual and empirical argument that debt is a source of deforestation pressure . Our study develops a behavioral model which suggests that debt can lead to myopic behavior , leading to deforestation rate that may not be optimal in the long run , but are necessary in the short run to meet current constraint . Then , country-by-country data on debt , deforestation , and other variable are analyzed with regression analysis . It is shown that debt is significantly correlated with deforestation under a wide variety of assumption and specification . Our result indicate that debt is an important factor in the deforestation of tropical country . There are certainly other source of deforestation , both micro- and macroeconomic , which may vary significantly from country to country . However , we focus on debt because of it dominant role in the economy of developing country , and because of the increased use of debt-for-nature swap . The link between debt and deforestation that is suggested in this paper implies that debt-for-nature swap may have a dual effect on deforestation . First , the contractual agreement is designed to preserve forest a part of the swap . Second , the reduction in debt may itself reduce the pressure to deforest , although this indirect effect is small . Our research provides evidence that reducing debt reduces deforestation , which may be an argument to offer deforesting third-world country some form of debt relief , and to utilize more fully debt-for-nature swap a a tool for preserving environmental quality .

aVIn investigation into the phenomenon of global warming , ocean acoustic tomography ( OAT ) ha been used for analysis . In this analysis method , the most important factor is exact calculation of the sound speed in water , that is , the sound wave propagation time . However , so far , analysis of SOFAR propagation in the low-latitude sea area ha been lacking . Such a sea area is very important for analysis of the El Nino Current and others , although a special sound speed structure appears in the region of uniform sound speed formed around the SOFAR axis . For SOFAR propagation , we have compared time-domain result using two model , based on the measurement of far-range sound wave propagation in the sea east of Mindanao Island . The model chosen for the analysis are Stickler 's normal mode method ( SNM ) and ray approximation . ( The SNM time series is obtained via Fourier synthesis . ) By this mean we examined the characteristic of wave theory and ray theory in the low-latitude sea area .

aVHalon fire extinguishing agent are used throughout the world to protect valuable electronics , oil and gas production operation , military system , a well a a number of other critical facility . Unfortunately , halon deplete stratospheric ozone , causing destruction at 3 to 16 time the rate of CFC-11 ( a common refrigerant ) . As a consequence , the production of halon wa prohibited on December 31 , 1993 by an international treaty , the Montreal Protocol . This ban on halon production resulted in a search for replacement chemical for firefighting and explosion protection application . Replacements must satisfy the following three criterion in order to be successful candidate : effectiveness , cleanliness , and environmental acceptability ( low ozone depletion and global warming potential ) . It is also necessary that a replacement agent be a non-toxic a possible relative to possible exposure and generate minimal toxic and corrosive decomposition product during the suppression event . Herein , the toxicological aspect of halon replacement are discussed . The specific toxic endpoint of concern for halocarbon candidate , a well a the kind of toxicity testing required for halon replacement , will be addressed . The paper will also provide a summary of the toxicological property for the most promising near term halon replacement . Associated decomposition product formation will be briefly discussed .

aVLength of exposure , degree of maturity and type of tissue all affect the result obtained in response to elevated CO2 treatment of tree . Seedlings are most responsive and , in many case , the first few week or month of exposure may set the pattern for future growth . Measurements of leaf photosynthesis and respiration are not good predictor for incorporation of carbon into tissue . Seasonal change in non-structural carbohydrate , emission of isoprenes from leaf and exudation from root can 'waste ' photosynthate . However , these are difficult or impossible to quantify . Currently , the only generalization that can be made is that growth will be accelerated but the magnitude of this depends on tissue type , nutrition and environmental condition . The implication of this for a future elevated atmospheric CO2 world are complex . Interactions and competition between specie should be incorporated into long-term study . These study must , themselves , be incorporated into appropriate model which take into account regional soil and climate for use in prediction of the effect of global climate change on tree and forest .

aVThis paper is intended to provide a brief review of the tropical seasonal forest , one type of the tropical moist forest in monsoon Asia . It will also focus on and summarise issue of current concern in relation to their depletion and global environmental issue . Tropical moist forest occur in the rainy tropical and monsoon tropical climate type . The tropical moist evergreen forest or the tropical rain forest , which account for two-thirds of the tropical moist forest are rich in biodiversity and contain valuable tropical hardwood . The tropical moist deciduous forest or the tropical seasonal forest which lie along the fringe of tropical rain forest , are le complex than the tropical rain forest and have more distinct wet and dry period . Broadleaved deciduous tree of the genus Tectona , Shorea , and Dipterocarpus are predominantly in this forest type . Currently estimate have found that more than 17 million hectare of forest mainly tropical moist forest are being lost each year . There is a widespread recognition that agriculture and the burning of tropical moist forest contribute to global warming but to a much lesser extent than the combustion of fossil fuel and industrial activity in the developed world .

aVThe purpose of this study is to investigate the variation and trend in the long-term annual mean air temperature by using graphical and statistical time-series method . The study cover a 63-year period starting from 1930 and us temperature record from 85 climate station . First , spatial distribution of the annual mean temperature and coefficient of variation are studied in order to show normal condition of the long-term annual mean temperature . Then variation and trend observed in the annual mean temperature are investigated using temperature data from 71 climate station and regional mean series . Various non-parametric test are used to detect abrupt change and trend in the long-term mean temperature of both geographical region within Turkey and individual station . The analysis indicate some noticeable variation and significant trend in the long-term annual mean temperature . Among the geographical region , only Eastern Anatolia appears to show similar behaviour to the global warming trend , except in the last 5 year . All the coastal region , however , are characterized by cooling trend in the last two decade . Considering the result of the statistical test applied to the 71 individual station data , it could be concluded that annual mean temperature are generally dominated by a cooling tendency in Turkey . The coldest year of the temperature record of the majority of the station were 1933 and 1992 , respectively .

aVThe industry is continuously being challenged by regulatory agency to find alternative to CFCs ( chlorofluoro-carbons ) for use in all application . Two solution investigated were to replace CFCs with HCFCs Olydrochloro-fluorocarbons or PFAs ( perfiuoroalkanes ) . However , the contribution of HCFCs to the depletion of the ozone layer ha been determined to be too high for them to be viewed a anything but an intermediate solution . PFAs have been getting attention for their high halogen global warming potential ( HGWP ) due to their long atmospheric lifetime and , thus , seem unlikely even a additive . At this time , it appears that both HCFCs and PFAs have a finite usage period in our industry . In our search for alternative , we have discovered that HFAs ( hydrofluoroalkanes or partially fluorinated alkane ) make fine , closed cell foam . As a result of this , HFA-blown rigid foam at 2.0 pcf density or lower have low initial k-factors ( 0.13 Btu in./hr ft ( 2 ) degree F ) . Aged k-factors are excellent because of the relatively slow cell gas diffusion of HFAs . These insulation value are similar to or better than those of foam made with HCFCs and PFAs ! The advantage to this technology is that HFAs have zero-ozone depletion potential ( ODP ) and relatively low HGWP , making HFAs viable long-term alternative . Processing of the alternative evaluated is similar to HCFC-22 technology , because the HFAs used in this investigation are gas at room temperature and pressure . The HFAs examined in this study were HFA-32 , 134a , 125 , and 227 . These HFAs all show the same characteristic of low solubility , low blowing efficiency , and higher working vapor pressure ; therefore , emulsion technology wa used ( a with PFAs ) . Good quality foam were produced without utilizing special compatibilizers .

aVPopulations of arctic-alpine plant at the southern periphery of their range should respond rapidly to projected global warming . We established a study to monitor the density and reproductive effort of six such specie in tundra of Glacier National Park , Montana to help project the fate of these specie in the center of their range . For many specie , detecting long-term population trend is confounded by short-term variation . Our study design employ temporal resampling of permanent plot on multiple site and a repeated-measures model that accommodates the effect of high frequency variation and allows assessment of the significance of long-term trend . Statistical analysis compare site-specific estimate of annual mean density between two time period and us between-plot , within-site , within-year variation to estimate error . Power calculation using data from the 3-yr baseline period indicate that measurement of fecundity will be le sensitive for detecting long-term trend than measurement of plant density . Furthermore , our result suggest that perennial specie of closed-turf community may be better bioassay of long-term change than annual or specie of open , ephemeral microsites .

aVThree cattle manure composting system - windrowing , forced aeration with temperature feedback control and simple minimal intervention ( manure stack - ''passive composting '' ) were compared with respect to specifically selected and operationally important process parameter including dry matter , moisture and volatile solid loss , volume reduction and bulk density change . The windrowing method proved to be the most effective with respect to the above parameter . Preliminary investigation of methane from the three system during processing showed that the minimal intervention method produced high level of methane ( > 4 percent ) in the waste matrix . The intervention method , of windrowing or forced aeration , drastically reduced methane output . The importance of animal manure in global agriculture , with reference to methane emission and global warming , is briefly reviewed . The widespread reliance of manure disposal by the use of simple stack , sometimes erroneously elevated to a processing status by use of the term ''passive composting '' , is questioned on ecological and environmental ground . The data from this preliminary study show the enormous impact that simple windrowing technique can achieve in term of organic waste conversion and product quality , concomittant with ecologically acceptable treatment route .

aVIn this paper , we present an inventory of greenhouse gas source and sink in Bangladesh for the year 1990 . Because CO2 is believed to be the principal contributor to global climate change worldwide , and energy use is the largest source of CO2 emission , much effort wa made to analyze the Bangladesh energy system . Carbon emission and carbon uptake in forest were also accounted for . Emissions of methane from agriculture , livestock , and urban landfill waste were also included in the inventory . In 1990 , energy production using fossil fuel accounted for 15.5 Tg of CO2 emission . Carbon emission resulting from forestry were also calculated . It wa found that about 5.46 Tg of carbon wa removed/consumed from the forest source in 1990 . On the other hand , about 12.32 Tg of carbon wa taken up in forest . Based on these number , which exclude bamboo , the forest of Bangladesh acted a a net sink for approximately 6.86 Tg of carbon in 1990 . Methane emission in 1990 from flooded rice cultivation ranged between 257 and 622 Gg , with a median of 439 Gg CH4 . Methane emission from the livestock sector were about 453 Gg CH4 . About 5.92 Gg CH4 are emitted due to venting , flaring , and transmission and distribution of natural gas . Methane emission from landfilled waste in the major urban area of Bangladesh contributed approximately 74 Gg CH4 .

aVThere is a great interest , especially in Western Canada , to capture carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) from fossil fuel fired power plant and utilize it a a flooding agent for enhanced oil recovery ( EOR ) process . This concept provides two important benefit : ( i ) captured CO2 can be utilized a a flooding agent which would generate revenue from incremental oil production , and ( ii ) CO2 emission to the atmosphere are reduced , helping to alleviate global warming . In the past few year , a number of feasibility study and pilot project on CO2 extraction from power plant have been performed . However , these result have shown that even though it is technically feasible to extract CO2 from power plant , the EOR application cost is high in the current crude petroleum market . A major reason for the high cost is that the CO2 extracting process requires a substantial amount of steam . This paper will demonstrate how cogeneration concept would help to reduce CO2 production cost by utilizing low-pressure steam and waste heat from various section of the power generation process . The economics are based on the installation of a power generation plant and CO2 recovery facility in an existing oil producing facility .

aVEstimating the contribution of deforestation to greenhouse gas emission requires calculation of the uptake of carbon by the vegetation that replaces the forest , a well a the emission from burning and decay of forest biomass and from altered emission and uptake by the soil . The role of regeneration in offsetting emission from deforestation in the Brazilian Legal Amazon ha sometimes been exaggerated . Unlike many other tropical area , cattle pasture ( rather than shifting cultivation ) usually replaces forest in Brazilian Amazonia . Degraded cattle pasture regenerate secondary forest more slowly than do fallow in shifting cultivation system , leading to lower uptake of carbon . The calculation presented here indicate that in 1990 the 410 X 10 ( 3 ) km ( 2 ) deforested landscape wa taking up 29 X 10 ( 6 ) t of carbon ( C ) annually ( 0.7 t C ha ( -1 ) year ( -1 ) ) . This doe not include the emission from clearing of secondary forest , which in 1990 released an estimated 27 X 10 ( 6 ) t C , almost completely offsetting the uptake from the landscape . Were the present land-use change process to continue , carbon uptake would rise to 365 X 10 ( 6 ) t annually ( 0.9 t C ha ( -1 ) year ( -1 ) ) in 2090 in the 3.9 X 10 ( 6 ) km ( 2 ) area that would have been deforested by that year . The 1990 rate of emission from deforestation in the region greatly exceeded the uptake from regrowth of replacement vegetation .

aVAlthough much of the commercial sector infrastructure for the next century is currently under construction or is in the planning stage , little ha been done in communicating how potential global warming might change the energy consumption characteristic of the building stock . The research discussed in this article advance the literature on how climate change affect commercial sector energy demand system . It project the effect of climate change on commercial energy demand in the United States at the national level . The article relies heavily on time-series regression of monthly energy consumption by building on monthly heating and cooling degree day . It provides empirical result for the effect of climate on a projected building stock in the year 2030 and examines the prospect for saving energy with advanced building design in the context of potential global warming .

aVRecognizing the need for a long-term database to address the problem of global climate change , the National Climatic Data Center ha embarked on a project called the Comprehensive Aerological Reference Data Set to create an upper-air database consisting of radiosondes , pibals , surface report , and station history for the Northern and Southern Hemispheres . Unfortunately , these data contain systematic error caused by change in instrument , data acquisition procedure , etc . It is essential that systematic error be identified and/or removed before these data can be used confidently in the context of greenhouse-gas-induced climate modification . The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the use of an adaptive moving average filter in detecting systematic bias and to compare it performance with the Schwarz criterion , a parametric method . The advantage of the adaptive filter over traditional parametric method is that it is le affected by seasonal pattern and trend . The filter ha been applied to upper air relative humidity and temperature data . The accuracy of locating the time at which a bias is introduced range from about 600 day for Changes of 0.1 standard deviation to about 20 day for change of 0.5 standard deviation .

aVThe economics of global warming is reviewed with special emphasis on how the cost depends on the discount rate and on how cost in poor and rich region are aggregated into a global cost estimate . Both of these factor depend on the assumption made concerning the underlying utility and welfare function . It is common to aggregate welfare gain and loss across generation and country a if the utility of money were constant , but it is not . If we assume that a CO2-equivalent doubling implies cost equal to 1.5 % of the income in both high and low income country , a pure rate of time preference equal to zero , and a utility function which is logarithmic in income , then the marginal cost of CO2 emission is estimated at 260-590 USD/ton C for a time horizon in the range 300-1000 year , an estimate which is large enough to justify significant reduction of CO2 emission on purely economic ground . The estimate is approximately 50-100-times larger than the estimate made by Nordhaus in his DICE model and the difference is almost completely due to the choice of discount rate and the weight given to the cost in the developing world a well a a more accurate model of the carbon cycle , Finally , the sensitivity of the marginal cost estimate with respect to several parameter is analyzed .

aVIncreased storminess is a likely consequence of global climate change ; it effect may be most dramatic on coast dominated by sandy beach . This scenario demand that the impact of storm and the role of armouring structure , constructed a storm defence , are better understood . Here , we ass how a relatively small storm affected beach morphology and macrobenthos , and whether a seawall can modulate such impact . The study system wa a small ( < 1.5 km long ) beach , bisected into part with and without a seawall . The beach became narrower and steeper during the storm , when 26 % of the subaerial sediment prism eroded from the armoured section ; sand loss on the unarmoured part were one-fifth of those on the armoured part . Densities of ghost crab ( Ocypode ) dropped significantly ( 36 % ) and were to some extent modulated by shore armouring ; loss were high ( 62 % ) just seaward of the seawall where post-storm density remained consistently lower . There wa no ecological recovery in the short term , with most ( 83 % ) post-storm density value of crab being lower , and crab count in front of the seawall being depressed up to 3 month after the storm . Seawalls can change the resilience of beach to storm , which may result in stronger ecological effect on armoured coast .

aVConservation agriculture can provide a low-cost competitive option to mitigate global warming with reduction or elimination of soil tillage and increase soil organic carbon ( SOC ) . Most study have evaluated the impact of zero till ( ZT ) only on surface soil layer ( down to 30 cm ) , and few study have been performed on the potential for C accumulation in deeper layer ( 0-100 cm ) of tropical and subtropical soil . In order to determine whether the change from conventional tillage ( CT ) to ZT ha induced a net gain in SOC , three long-term experiment ( 15-26 year ) on free-draining Ferralsols in the subtropical region of South Brazil were sampled and the SOC stock to 30 and 100 cm calculated on an equivalent soil mass basis . In rotation containing intercropped or cover-crop legume , there were significant accumulation of SOC in ZT soil varying from 5 to 8 Mg ha-1 in comparison with CT management , equivalent to annual soil C accumulation rate of between 0.04 and 0.88 Mg ha-1 . However , the potential for soil C accumulation wa considerably increased ( varying from 0.48 to 1.53 Mg ha-1 yr-1 ) when considering the soil profile down to 100 cm depth . On average the estimate of soil C accumulation to 100 cm depth wa 59 % greater than that for soil C accumulated to 30 cm . These finding suggest that increasing sampling depth from 30 cm ( a presently recommended by the IPCC ) to 100 cm , may increase substantially the estimate of potential CO ( 2 ) mitigation induced by the change from CT to ZT on the free-draining Ferralsols of the tropic and subtropics . It wa evident that that legume which contributed a net input of biologically fixed N played an important role in promoting soil C accumulation in these soil under ZT , perhaps due to a slow-release of N from decaying surface residues/roots which favored maize root growth .

aVClimate change is expected to alter the Arctic 's carbon ( C ) balance and change in these C-rich ecosystem may contribute to a positive feedback on global climate change . Low-center mudboils , a form of patterned ground in the Arctic , are distinct landforms in which the exchange of greenhouse gas between the atmosphere and soil ha not been fully characterized , but which may have an important influence on the overall C balance of tundra ecosystem . Chamber system were used to sample net ecosystem exchange of CO ( 2 ) ( NEE ) and CO ( 2 ) and CH ( 4 ) efflux along a 35-m transect intersecting two mudboils in a wet sedge fen in Canada 's Southern Arctic ( lat . 64 degree 52'N , long . 111 degree 34'W ) during the summer month in 2008 . Mudboil feature gave rise to dramatic variation in vegetation , soil temperature and thaw depth , and soil organic matter content along this transect . Variations in NEE were driven by variation in the amount of vascular vegetation , while CO ( 2 ) and CH ( 4 ) efflux were remarkably similar among the two mudboil ( CO ( 2 ) efflux : 1.1 +/- 0.9 and 1.4 +/- 0.7 mu mol m ( -2 ) s ( -1 ) ; CH ( 4 ) efflux : 83.1 +/- 189.4 and 23.1 +/- 9.4 nmol m ( -2 ) s ( -1 ) , +/-1 standard deviation ) and the sedge fen ( CO ( 2 ) efflux : 1.6 +/- 0.7 mu mol m ( -2 ) s ( -1 ) ; CH ( 4 ) efflux : 28.0 +/- 62.0 nmol m ( -2 ) s ( -1 ) ) sampling area . Vegetation appeared to play an important role in limiting temporal variation in CH ( 4 ) efflux through plant mediated transport in both mudboil and sedge fen sampling area . One of the mudboils had negligible vascular plant colonization presumably due to more active frost heave process . The relatively high CO ( 2 ) and CH ( 4 ) efflux in this mudboil area wa speculated to be a result of growth and decomposition of cryptogamic organism , inflow of dissolved organic C , and warmer soil temperature .

aVThe U.S. is strongly considering regulating hydrofluorocarbon ( HFCs ) due to their global climate change forcing effect . A drop-in replacement hydrofluoroether ha been evaluated using a gate-to-grave life cycle assessment of greenhouse gas emission for the trade-off between direct and indirect carbon dioxide equivalent emission compared to a current HFC and a historically used refrigerant . The result indicate current regulation being considered may increase global climate change .

aVThe idea of market-based carbon emission trading and carbon tax is gaining in popularity a a global climate change policy instrument . However , these mechanism might not necessarily have a positive outcome unless their value reflects socioeconomic and environmental impact and regulation . Moreover , the fact that they have various inherent exogenous and endogenous uncertainty raise serious concern about their ability to reduce emission in a cost-effective way . This paper aim to introduce a simple stochastic model that allows the robustness of economic mechanism for emission reduction under multiple natural and human-related uncertainty to be analyzed . Unlike standard equilibrium state analysis , the model show that the explicit introduction of uncertainty regarding emission , abatement cost , and equilibrium state make it almost impossible for existing market-based trading and carbon tax to be environmentally safe and cost-effective . Here we propose a computerized multi-agent trading model . This can be viewed a a prototype to simulate an emission trading market that is regulated in a decentralized way . We argue that a market of this type is better equipped to deal with long-term emission reduction , their direct regulation , irreversibility , and `` lock-in '' equilibrium .

aVThe increasing demand for environmental information on the global warming impact of product requires a solid methodological framework which guarantee comparability and communicability . The publicly available specification PAS 2050 combine approach to a variety of greenhouse gas specific assessment issue to deliver a globally applicable product Carbon Footprinting ( CF ) method , which is expected to be widely accepted . Specifically , this paper aim to demonstrate the implementation of a CF scheme for a common canned mussel product according to PAS 2050 guideline . A final value of 4.35 kg CO ( 2 ) e per triple pack of round can of mussel wa calculated . Furthermore , this CF study led to identify primary packaging ( can production ) and mussel shell management a the main activity where effort should focus for climate change mitigation . Throughout this case study . CF opportunity and drawback are discussed . The whole text try to provide a starting point for both mussel processor and policy maker to benefit from the potential advantage of a responsible use of this increasingly popular tool .

aVMediterranean tree specie experience unpredictable climate environment and severe summer drought and they may be impaired by the trend of decline in precipitation projected a a consequence of global climate change . The response of Quercus ilex to drought wa studied by measuring hydraulic trait of tree growing in a mature forest subjected to partial throughfall exclusion for 6 year . We measured hydraulic conductivity , xylem vulnerability to embolism , and anatomical feature in branch and root . Xylem vulnerability to embolism wa higher in the dry treatment than in the control treatment , P ( 50 ) of branch wa on average -3.88 +/- 0.80 MPa for the control treatment compared with -3.41 +/- 0.80 MPa for the dry treatment , but the difference wa not statistically significant . A similar difference between treatment wa observed for root , which exhibited lower P ( 50 ) value . This change of xylem vulnerability to embolism wa not linked to modification of the hydraulic conductivity or vessel anatomy , which remained unaffected by the throughfall exclusion treatment . The xylem density of branch wa lower in the dry treatment . The hydraulic conductivity wa correlated with the mean vessel diameter of xylem , but the P ( 50 ) wa not . The main response of tree from the dry treatment to reduced water availability appeared to be a reduction in the transpiring leaf area , which resulted in significantly increased leaf-specific conductivity .

aVThe abundance of Nile shrimp , Caridina nilotica ( Roux ) in Lake Victoria ha fluctuated significantly over time , from the period of 1900-1950s , 1980s-1990s and from 2000s to present day . To elucidate it current abundance , it contribution to the Rastrineobola argentea fishery catch , and it importance to the composition of the diet of Nile perch ( Lates niloticus L. ) , and to the bottom trawl catch , were investigated . From August 2006 to January 2007 , the mean C. nilotica CPUE wa 1.68 +/- 1.20 kg boat ( -1 ) day ( -1 ) at Kijiweni and Igombe , and it 0.37 % contribution to the R. argentea total catch wa insignificant . Of the 230 Nile perch stomach containing prey item , C. nilotica comprised 54 % by volume of the diet of fish 50 cm TL . Mean catch rate of C. nilotica in bottom trawl in 8 month between 2005 and 2008 ranged between 0 and 2.45 +/- 2.50 kg hr ( -1 ) . Low catch of the C. nilotica in the R. argentea fishery , and the dietary shift of Nile perch of > 50 cm TL to once again include haplochromines , may indicate a decrease in C. nilotica 's abundance in the lake , and vice versa . Overfishing and the selectivity of the fishery to take only large Nile perch for fish filleting factory , have resulted in reduced stock and dominance of juvenile in the perch 's population . The highly reduced Nile perch stock are currently leading to an apparent reversal of the 1980s regime with a shift to a new cichlid-dominated and C. nilotica low abundance state . Increase in predation on juvenile C. nilotica by the recovering haplochromines , and juvenile perch , a well a environmental degradation , especially eutrophication and pollution , along with the effect of global warming impact , account for the observed decline in C. nilotica .

aVIn the Republic of Korea , most denuded forest land have been restored since the 1960s . In addition , the annual mean temperature in the Republic of Korea ha increased approximate to 1.0 degree C during the last century , which is higher than the global mean increase of 0.74 degree C. Such rapid environmental change may have resulted in change in the local butterfly fauna . For example , the number of butterfly inhabiting forest may have increased because of reforestation , whereas the number of butterfly inhabiting grassland may have declined . Furthermore , the number of northern butterfly may have declined , whereas the number of southern butterfly may have increased in response to global warming . Therefore , we compared current data ( 2002 approximate to 2007 ) regarding the abundance of butterfly specie at two site in the central portion of the Korean Peninsula to data from the late 1950s and early 1970s for the same site . Changes in the abundance rank of each specie between the two period were evaluated to determine whether any pattern corresponded to the predicted temporal change . The predicted change in butterfly abundance were confirmed in this study . In addition , the result showed a different response to habitat change between northern and southern specie . In northern butterfly specie , butterfly inhabiting forest increased , whereas those inhabiting grassland declined . However , the opposite wa true when southern butterfly specie were evaluated . Changes in the abundance indicate that habitat change may be one of the key factor related to the survival of population that remain around the southern boundary of butterfly specie .

aVDeep convection over tropical ocean is observed generally above a threshold for sea surface temperature ( 1-4 ) , which fall in the vicinity of 26-28 degree C. High-resolution model suggest that the related sea surface temperature threshold for tropical cyclone rise in a warming climate ( 5,6 ) . Some observation for the past few decade , however , show that tropical tropospheric warming ha been nearly uniform vertically ( 7,8 ) , suggesting that the troposphere may have become le stable and casting doubt on the possibility that the sea surface temperature threshold increase substantially with global warming . Here we turn to satellite observation of rainfall for the past 30 year . We detect significant covariability between tropical mean sea surface temperature and the convective threshold on interannual and longer timescales . In addition , we find a parallel upward trend of approximately 0.1 degree C/decade over the past 30 year in both the convective threshold and tropical mean sea surface temperature . We conclude that , in contrast with some observational indication , the tropical troposphere ha warmed in a way that is consistent with moist-adiabatic adjustment , in agreement with global climate model simulation .

aVThe Tropical Cyclone Genesis Potential Index ( GPI ) wa employed to investigate possible impact of global warming on tropical cyclone genesis over the western North Pacific ( WNP ) . The output of 20th century climate simulation by eighteen GCMs were used to evaluate the model ' ability to reproduce tropical cyclone genesis via the GPI . The GCMs were found in general to reasonably reproduce the observed spatial distribution of genesis . Some of the model also showed ability in capturing observed temporal variation . Based on the evaluation , the model ( CGCM3.1-T47 and IPSL-CM4 ) found to perform best when reproducing both spatial and temporal feature were chosen to project future GPI . Results show that both of these model project an upward trend of the GPI under the SRES A2 scenario , however the rate of increase differs between them .

aVUsing a process-based model , I assessed how ecophysiological process would respond to near-future global change predicted by coupled atmosphere-ocean climate model . An ecosystem model , Vegetation Integrative SImulator for Trace gas ( VISIT ) , wa applied to four site in East Asia ( different type of forest in Takayama , Tomakomai , and Fujiyoshida , Japan , and an Alpine grassland in Qinghai , China ) where observational flux data are available for model calibration . The climate model predicted +1-3A degree C warming and slight change in annual precipitation by 2050 a a result of an increase in atmospheric CO ( 2 ) . Gross primary production ( GPP ) wa estimated to increase substantially at each site because of improved efficiency in the use of water and radiation . Although increased respiration partly offset the GPP increase , the simulation showed that these ecosystem would act a net carbon sink independent of disturbance-induced uptake for recovery . However , the carbon budget response relied strongly on nitrogen availability , such that photosynthetic down-regulation resulting from leaf nitrogen dilution largely decreased GPP . In relation to long-term monitoring , these result indicate that the impact of global warming may be more evident in gross flux ( e.g. , photosynthesis and respiration ) than in the net CO ( 2 ) budget , because change in these flux offset each other .

aVThe retreat of glacier worldwide , from the Alpine area to Antarctica , in the course of the last few decade , is frequently mentioned a a clear and unambiguous sign of global warming . In the Alps , although the warming experienced since the early 1980s is synchronous with warming at the global scale , nevertheless it amplitude is greater and it represents roughly a two-fold amplification of the global climate signal . As a result of this rapid climate change , many small glacier could disappear in the next few decade . These small glacier , common in the Alps , are also important in term of environmental and economic system . The rapid 'disintegration ' of Alpine glacier ha already been discussed in previous study ; le attention , however , ha been paid to their role a changing and potentially vanishing geomorphosites . Most Alpine glacier , in fact , subject to rapid change driven by climate , are now responsible for unexpected environmental impact , which in the Italian Alps have only been partially investigated . This paper analysis and discus feature and evolution in two representative glacier geomorphosites included in the official 'Geosites Inventory ' of the Lombardy region ( Italy ) . In Lombardy ( Italian Alps ) 348 glacier covered an area of about 92 km ( 2 ) in 2003 . They were found to have decreased in area by about 21 % in the period 1990-2003 . The geomorphosites analysed are the Forni Glacier , the largest valley glacier in the Italian Alps , and the Val Viola glacierised basin , where various small glacier with well-preserved moraine ridge ( dating from the Lateglacial to the present ) can be found . Both the geosites are located in area identified a 'Sites of Community Importance ' ( SCI ) under directive 92/43/EEC ; furthermore , the Forni Glacier is also located in a protected area , the Stelvio National Park . These glacier geomorphosites represent well the variation affecting all Alpine glacier ; these variation are not only driving significant change in the morphology and ecology of the present mountain landscape , but at the same time are shaping newly formed morphology , which may develop into smaller geomorphosites with significant value from a scientific and cultural point of view . The change include thermokarst feature such a kettle and supraglacial lake , debris-covered glacier tongue frequently without any direct connection with the actual glacier , rounded rock outcrop emerging from the glacier surface which increase ice melting and accelerate glacier shrinkage , ice contact and moraine-dammed lake where calving phenomenon occur and iceberg drift loose , moraine affected by ice core melting with subsequent collapse and generation of mud and debris flow .

aVChanging regional and global trend in climate and discharge , such a global warming-related decline in annual rainfall in south-eastern Africa , are likely to have a strong influence on water resource availability , and to increase livelihood risk . It is therefore important to characterise such trend . Information can be obtained by examining and comparing the rainfall and runoff record at different location within a basin . In this study , trend in various parameter of temperature ( 4 station ) , rainfall ( 10 station ) and discharge ( 16 station ) from the northern part of the Limpopo Basin , Zimbabwe , were statistically analysed , using the Spearman rank test , the Mann-Kendall test and the Pettitt test . It wa determined that rainfall and discharge in the study area have undergone a notable decline since 1980 , both in term of total annual water resource ( decline in annual rainfall , annual unit runoff ) and in term of the temporal availability of water ( decline in number of rainy day , increase in dry spell , increase in day without flow ) . Annual rainfall is negatively correlated to an index of the El Nino - Southern Oscillation phenomenon . The main area of rising risk are an increasing number of dry spell , which is likely to decrease crop yield , and an increasing probability of annual discharge below the long-term average , which could limit blue-water availability . As rainfall continues to decline , it is likely that a multiplier effect will be felt on discharge . Increasing food shortage are a likely consequence of the impact of this declining water resource availability on rain-fed and irrigated agriculture . Declining water resource availability will also further stress urban water supply , notably those of Zimbabwe 's second-largest city of Bulawayo , which depends to a large extent from these water resource and already experience chronic water shortage .

aVIn this analysis , we characterize urban and rural ozone ( O ( 3 ) ) trend across the US for the period 1980-2008 ( 29 year ) and 1994-2008 ( 15 year ) using three exposure metric , which summarize daily O ( 3 ) concentration to reflect different way O ( 3 ) may affect human health and vegetation . We observe that a statistically significant trend at a specific monitoring site , using one exposure metric , doe not necessarily result in a similar trend using the other two metric . The two most common trend among the monitoring site are either a continuation of negative trending over the 29-year period or a shift from negative to no trend status , indicating a leveling off of the trending . Very few site exhibit statistically significant increase in the exposure index . In characterizing the statistically significant change in the distribution of hourly average O ( 3 ) , we observe subtle statistically significant change in the lower part of the distribution ( i.e. , below 50 ppb ) that are not necessarily captured by the trending pattern associated with the three exposure metric . Using multisite data from 12 metropolitan city , we find that a the frequency of higher hourly average concentration is reduced , the lower hourly average concentration also move upward toward the mid-level value . The change in the number of the hourly average concentration in the lower range is consistent with decreased NO scavenging . We recommend assessing possible subtle shift in O ( 3 ) concentration by characterizing change in the distribution of hourly average concentration by month . Identifying statistically significant monthly change in the mid- and low-level hourly average concentration may provide important information for assessing change in physical process associated with global climate change , long-range transport , and the efficacy of model used for emission and risk reduction . Our result indicate that it is important to investigate the change in the trending pattern with time ( e.g. , moving 15-year trending ) in order to ass how year-to-year variability may influence the trend calculation .

aVClimate and environmental change associated with anthropogenic global warming are being increasingly identified in the European Alps , a seen by change in long-term high-alpine temperature , precipitation , glacier cover and permafrost . In turn , these change impact on land-surface stability , and lead to increased frequency and magnitude of natural mountain hazard , including rock fall , debris flow , landslide , avalanche and flood . These hazard also impact on infrastructure , and socio-economic and cultural activity in mountain region . This paper present two case study ( 2003 heatwave , 2005 flood ) that demonstrate some of the interlinkages between physical process and human activity in climatically sensitive alpine region that are responding to ongoing climate change . Based on this evidence , we outline future implication of climate change on mountain environment and it impact on hazard and hazard management in paraglacial mountain system .

aVBased on the meteorological and hydrologic data in the Lijang ( sic ) basin from 1979 to 2006 , variational trend and characteristic of climate change and it effect on runoff in Yanggong ( sic ) River were examined in the study . The result show that the temperature have significantly increased in the drainage basin during the past 28 year . The average temperature increased markedly from 1979 to 2006 , and the increase of temperature in winter wa higher than those in other season . The annual precipitation varied with a slightly upward trend in the same period , suggesting that the increase mainly occurred in spring and summer while the decrease occurred in autumn and winter . The streamflow at Yanggong River showed a significant increasing trend . During the four season , spring experienced the most significant increase , and autumn experienced the smallest . On the basis of the above study , we found that the increasing trend in runoff wa more significant than the increase in precipitation in the study area . That wa the synactic result of variation of groundwater , ice-snow meltwater and precipitation caused by global climate change .

aVThere is now unequivocal evidence for global climate change ; however , it potential impact on evolutionary process remain unclear . Many specie have responded to contemporary climate change through shift in their geographic range . This could lead to increased sympatry between recently diverged specie ; likely increasing the potential for hybridization . Recently , following a series of warm winter , southern flying squirrel ( Glaucomys volans ) in Ontario , Canada rapidly expanded their northern range limit resulting in increased sympatry with the closely related northern flying squirrel ( Glaucomys sabrinus ) . This provided the opportunity to test the prediction that contemporary climate change can act a a catalyst creating condition for the formation of hybrid zone . Following extensive sampling and molecular analysis ( nuclear and mitochondrial DNA ) , we identified the occurrence of hybridization between sympatric G. sabrinus and G. volans . There wa evidence of backcrossing but not of extensive introgession , consistent with the hypothesis of recent rather than historic hybridization . To our knowledge , this is the first report of hybrid zone formation following a range expansion induced by contemporary climate change . This is also the first report of hybridization between North American flying squirrel specie .

aVStatic network of nature reserve disregard the dynamic of specie range in changing environment . In fact , climate warming ha been shown to potentially drive endangered specie out of reserve . Less attention ha been paid to the related problem that a warmer climate may also foster the invasion of alien specie into reserve network . Here , we use niche-based predictive modelling to ass to which extent the Austrian Natura 2000 network and a number of habitat type of conservation value outside this network might be prone to climate warming driven change in invasion risk by Robinia pseudacacia L. , one of the most problematic alien plant in Europe . Results suggest that the area potentially invaded by R. pseudacacia will increase considerably under a warmer climate . Interestingly , invasion risk will grow at a higher than average rate for most of the studied habitat type but le than the national average in Natura 2000 site . This result point to a potential bias in legal protection towards high mountain area which largely will remain too cold for R. pseudacacia . In contrast , the selected habitat type are more frequent in montane or lower lying region , where R. pseudacacia invasion risk will increase most pronouncedly . We conclude that management plan of nature reserve should incorporate global warming driven change in invasion risk in a more explicit manner . In case of R. pseudacacia , reducing propagule pressure by avoiding purposeful plantation in the neighbourhood of reserve and endangered habitat is a simple but crucial measure to prevent further invasion under a warmer climate .

aVClimate change impact in large marine ecosystem ( LMEs ) are driven by global climate variability , often communicated over large distance by atmospheric teleconnections , and modified by the dominant local and regional ocean process . The focus of this paper is to summarize the key process and feature that characterize the major coastal LMEs of the Pacific , a part of a greater effort to understand the role of past and future global climate change in driving ( possibly synchronous ) fluctuation in marine population . The physical setting of five LMEs - the Humboldt Current System ( HCS ) , California Current System ( CCS ) , Gulf of Alaska ( GOA ) , Kuroshio Current System ( KCS ) , and Oyashio Current System ( OCS ) - and the mechanism and impact of climate variability on these system are described . Because of their pivotal role in linking and perhaps synchronizing climate variability in disparate LMEs , we also review teleconnections and analyze past global atmospheric teleconnections and regional ocean response pattern . The major Pacific eastern boundary current system , the CCS and HCS , feature similar dominant process ( e.g. , coastal upwelling ) , and share atmospheric forcing from common teleconnection pattern that vary together . Sea level pressure variation forcing the KCS and OCS system on climate scale , however , are not strongly teleconnected to the CCS and HCS . A common factor analysis of sea surface temperature ( SST ) within these ecosystem provides an example of how LMEs have responded to past climate variability . All LMEs display a persistent warming tendency since 1900 , with multi-decadal fluctuation superimposed . However , SST fluctuation in the western Pacific lag those in the east by about a decade . Global synchrony in climate forcing is modulated by distinct process within each LME , which reduce the correlation between long-term fluctuation . Published by Elsevier B.V .

aVThe climate response over Asia/Arctic to the change in orbital parameter for the last interglacial maximum ( LIGM ) is investigated using the NCAR CCM3 . After implementing LIGM orbital parameter , the insolation decrease in January and increase in July in the northern hemisphere in comparison to present value . The reduced net short-wave radiative heat flux in January lead to the surface cooling in low to mid latitude of Asia , whereas a warming is obtained in northern Asia where the net short-wave radiative heat flux change little . The January warming in northern Asia/Arctic in the LIGM , consistent with proxy record , is mainly due to the marked increase in downward long wave heat flux associated with the increase in cloud and in part by the increase in the Arctic Oscillation polarity . In July , the increased insolation lead to the surface warming over most Asia , even though a slight cooling is obtained in low latitude in spite of the increase in insolation , due to the decrease in the short-wave heat flux at the surface by the increase in the cloud amount . Precipitation overall increase at South and East Asia in July , due to the stronger southwest and southerly wind . The change in insolation due to the orbital parameter determines the climate change pattern in low- to mid-latitudes over Asia in the LIGM , even though the degree of climate change is much lower than suggested by proxy estimate . The result obtained in this study implies that , under the different climate background such a future global warming , the change in greenhouse effect associated with cloud feedback could play an important role in determining the climate change over Asia/Arctic .

aVGlobal temperature are rising , and are expected to produce a poleward shift in the distribution of many organism . We quantified change in fish assemblage within seagrass meadow of the northern Gulf of Mexico ( GOM ) between the 1970s and 2006-2007 , and observed change consistent with this forecast . During 2006-2007 we sampled seagrass meadow using the same gear and method previously employed by R. J. Livingston in coastal water of northwest Florida throughout the 1970s . Comparisons between datasets revealed numerous addition to the fish fauna during 2006-2007 that were completely absent in the 1970s , including : Lutjanus synagris ( lane snapper ) , Epinephelus morio ( red grouper ) , Chaetodon ocellatus ( spotfin butterflyfish ) , Mycteroperca sp ( grouper , non gag ) , Centropristis philadelphica ( rock sea bass ) , Fistularia tabacaria ( bluespotted cornetfish ) , Ocyurus chrysurus ( yellowtail snapper ) , Thalassoma bifasciatum ( bluehead wrasse ) , Abudefduf saxatilis ( sergeant major ) , Acanthuridae spp . ( surgeonfish ) and Sparisoma viride ( stoplight parrotfish ) . Several other specie showed large increase in abundance during the interval between 1979 and 2006 , including Mycteroperca microlepis ( gag grouper , up similar to 200 x ) , Lutjanus griseus ( gray snapper , up similar to 105 x ) , and Nicholsina usta ( emerald parrotfish , up similar to 22 x ) . All of these are tropical or subtropical specie that now make up a greater percentage of seagrass-associated fish assemblage in the northern GOM than in the past . Additionally , we observed regional increase in air and sea surface temperature ( > 3 degree C ) during the similar to 30 year that separate Livingston 's sample and ours that correlate with northern shift in the distribution of warm-water fish . Documenting these range shift is a critical first step in investigating the consequence of global warming for endemic marine community and fishery production in the northern GOM .

aVClimate change is altering geographical range , population dynamic and phenologies of many organism . For ectotherm , increased ambient temperature frequently have direct consequence for metabolic rate , activity pattern and developmental rate . Consequently , in many insect specie both an earlier beginning and prolongation of seasonal duration occurred in parallel with recent global warming . However , from an ecological and evolutionary perspective , the number of generation ( voltinism ) and investment into each generation may be even more important than seasonality , since an additional generation per unit time may accelerate population growth or adaptation . Using a dataset extending back to the mid-nineteenth century , I report change in the voltinism of butterfly and moth specie of Central Europe . A significant proportion of 263 multi-voltine specie showed augmented frequency of second and subsequent generation relative to the first generation in a warm period since 1980 , and 44 specie even increased the number of generation after 1980 . Expected ecological consequence are diverse . Since multi-voltinism ha been linked to insect outbreak they include an increase in the abundance of herbivorous pest of agriculture and forestry . However , disruption of the developmental synchrony associated with multi-voltinism and host plant phenology may also reduce fitness , potentially having unexpected consequence for specie of conservation concern . The ability of specie to adapt evolutionarily to a changing environment may be facilitated by increased voltinism .

aVCoastal erosion is assuming large proportion these day . Global climate change coupled with local attribute is eroding the coast of the world in alarming proportion . Most of the conventional protection method are hard , short lived , expensive and not eco-friendly . Trend in coastal erosion mitigation and protection ha been shifting these day towards soft but novel , eco-friendly method . Pro-active method are being developed and used which are eco-friendly , construction-friendly , cheaper and which also reasonably address the root cause of the problem without much 'side effect ' . Many non-traditional way to armor , stabilize or restore beach , including the use of patented precast concrete unit , geotextile sand-filled bag , green belt , bio-engineering , sand fencing , beach-face dewatering system , integrated costal protection method are being used . Retreat from the coast is also thought about , in many circle . Present study consists the global coastal erosion scenario and also some of the state of the art soft and pro-active erosion mitigation method .

aVCOASTAL PALAEOENVIRONMENTS DURING THE LAST 8000 YEARS ON THE LION GULF WESTERN SIDE : THE SAND BAR OF THE THAU COASTAL LAGOON ( SETIF CORING , SETE , HERAULT ) The present active lagoon system of the Than lagoon ha begun shortly alter 7050 BP ( 5580-5255 cal BC ) . However , the setting up of the coastal system coupling sand bar and coastal lagoon took place probably before . This system belongs to a morphosystem dominated by the wave within a sedimentary context poor in sedimentary source . The present erosion of this littoral echo back to an ancient dynamic showing a backing of the sand bar joining the Mount Saint-Clair to the Pioch ( Agde volcano ) shortly after 6500 BP ( 5068-4660 cal BC ) . The pollen analysis of sequence SETIF report this dynamic instability and allows it to outline the coastal vegetation evolution . The pollen sequence show both the global warming and the palaeoecological and palaeogeographical change that are characteristic of this coastal area . The local thermophilous feature of the life condition linked to the Mount Saint-Clair , the perception of the offshore bar arrival , the fluctuation of the unsteady environment ( sand bar , lagoon bank ) and the different stage of human activity recorded since the ancient Neolithic are the main contribution of the SETIF palynological result . The observation related to the local relative sea level are consistent with the regional data . but show some peculiarity such a the perched characteristic of the salt water table forming the Than coastal palaeo-lagoon until 6540 40 BP ( 5068-4660 BC ) .

aVAfforestation and reforestation have become popular instrument of climate mitigation policy , a forest are known to store large quantity of carbon . However , they also modify the flux of energy , water and momentum at the land surface . Previous study have shown that these biogeophysical effect can counteract the carbon drawdown and , in boreal latitude , even overcompensate it due to large albedo difference between forest canopy and snow . This study investigates the role forest cover play for global climate by conducting deforestation and afforestation experiment with the earth system model of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology ( MPI-ESM ) . Complete deforestation of the tropic ( 18.75 degree S-15 degree N ) exerts a global warming of 0.4 degree C due to an increase in CO ( 2 ) concentration by initially 60 ppm and a decrease in evapotranspiration in the deforested area . In the northern latitude ( 45 degree N-90 degree N ) , complete deforestation exerts a global cooling of 0.25 degree C after 100 year , while afforestation lead to an equally large warming , despite the counteracting change in CO ( 2 ) concentration . Earlier model study are qualitatively confirmed by these finding . As the response of temperature a well a terrestrial carbon pool is not of equal sign at every land cell , considering forest a cooling in the tropic and warming in high latitude seems to be true only for the spatial mean , but not on a local scale .

aVCarbon dioxide ( CO ( 2 ) ) ha received significant interest a an alternative refrigerant for air-conditioning compressor due to it environmental benefit . These environmental benefit include zero ozone depletion potential and minimal global warming potential compared to commonly used hydrochlorofluorocarbon and hydrofluorocarbon refrigerant . This study present result for three typical metallic tribopairs commonly found in air conditioning compressor , namely , Al390-T6 , gray cast iron , and Mn-Si brass against 52,100 steel pin . The experiment were performed using a specialized tribometer capable of simulating compressor condition , and in the presence of CO ( 2 ) and polyalkylene glycol lubricant . It wa found that the scuffing resistance of gray cast iron and Mn-Si brass wa similar and both material performed better than Al390-T6 . Through scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy it wa found that lead in Mn-Si brass melted during scuffing , and prevented sudden catastrophic failure of Mn-Si brass , unlike gray cast iron and Al390-T6 which failed abruptly . X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy conducted on the worn surface showed that chemically different specie were present on the surface and their lubricious effect , originating from different metal oxide , could explain the scuffing behavior of the investigated alloy .

aVThe aim of the study is to analyze three different waste treatment technology by life cycle assessment tool . Sanitary Landfill , Incineration and gasification-pyrolysis of the waste treatment technology are studied in SimaPro software based on input-output material flow . SimaPro software ha been applied for analyzing environmental burden by different impact category . All technology are favorable to abiotic and ozone layer depletion due to energy recovery from the waste treatment facility . Sanitary landfill ha the significantly lower environmental impact among other thermal treatment while gas are used for fuel with control emission environment . However , sanitary landfill ha significant impact on photochemical oxidation , global warming and acidification . Among thermal technology , pyrolysis-gasification is comparatively more favorable to environment than incineration in global warming , acidification , eutrophication and eco-toxicity category . Landfill with energy recovery facility is environmentally favorable . However , due to large land requirement , difficult emission control system and long time span , restriction on land filling is applying more in the developed country . Pyrolysis-gasification is more environmental friendly technology than incineration due to higher energy recovery efficiency . Life cycle assessment is an effective tool to analyze waste treatment technology based on environmental performance .

aVThis study evaluated feed manufacturing including dry feeding and wet feeding , composting , and landfilling for food waste disposal option from the perspective of global warming and resource recovery . The method of the expanded system boundary wa employed in order to compare different by-product . The whole stage of disposal involved in the system such a separate discharge , collection , transportation , treatment , and final disposal , were included in the system boundary and evaluated . The Global Warming Potential generated from 1 tonne of food waste for each disposal system wa analyzed by the life cycle assessment method . The result showed that 200 kg of CO ( 2 ) -eq could be produced from dry feeding process , 61 kg of CO ( 2 ) -eq from wet feeding process , 123 kg of CO ( 2 ) -eq from composting process , and 1010 kg of CO ( 2 ) -eq from landfilling . Feed manufacturing and composting , the common treatment method currently employed , have been known to be environment friendlier than other method . However , this study show that they can negatively affect the environment if their by-product are not appropriately utilized a intended . ( c ) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All right reserved .

aVThe Gove Crow butterfly , Euploea alcathoe enastri Fenner , 1991 , is restricted to Gove Peninsula of north-eastern Arnhem Land , a remote area of northern Australia . The subspecies ha been listed a an Endangered taxon under federal and Northern Territory legislation , and represents one of only a few case in the Australian Region in which a tropical butterfly ha been targeted for species-orientated conservation . However , accurate status evaluation and conservation management have been hampered by lack of detailed information on spatial distribution , critical habitat , and the extent and severity of threatening process . Surveys carried out during 2006-2008 indicate that the subspecies ha a limited geographical range ( extent of occurrence approximately 6,700 km ( 2 ) ) within which it is recorded from 11 location or subpopulation embracing a total of 21 site . Most site comprise discrete habitat patch that are relatively small in area ( < 10 ha ) within which adult are localised and occur in low abundance ( < 15 h ( -1 ) ) . Of the four major habitat type in which E. alcathoe enastri wa detected , only mixed paperbark tall open forest with rainforest element in the understorey and rainforest edge ( i.e . the ecotone between evergreen monsoon vine-forest and eucalypt/paperbark woodland ) comprise breeding habitat . These habitat patch were always associated with permanent creek or perennial groundwater seepage or spring that form swampland , usually along drainage line or flood plain in coastal or near coastal lowland area . Major threat identified at the site level are habitat modification through altered fire regime and habitat disturbance by feral animal ( buffalo , pig ) ; potential threat at the landscape level include habitat loss through invasive specie ( grassy weed , tramp ant ) and global climate change . However , since critical breeding area are subject to natural disturbance by both fire and flood , and occasionally cyclonic event , an optimal balance in disturbance regime is probably required to sustain breeding population . Although E. alcathoe enastri is a narrow-range endemic that is ecologically specialised , there is no evidence of decline . Accordingly , the conservation status of the subspecies should be regarded a Near Threatened ( 'Conservation Dependent ' ) under IUCN criterion . Components for an effective long-term conservation management plan of the butterfly and it habitat , which largely depend on the cooperation of traditional landowner and involvement of local indigenous ranger group , are briefly discussed .

aVWith abundant evidence of recent climate warming , most vegetation study have concentrated on it direct impact , such a modification to seasonal plant and animal life cycle event ( phenology ) . The most common example are indication of earlier onset of spring plant growth and delayed onset of autumn senescence . However , le attention ha been paid to the implication of continued warming for plant specie ' chilling requirement . Many woody plant that grow in temperate area require a certain amount of winter chilling to break dormancy and prepare to respond to springtime warming . Thus , a comprehensive assessment of plant specie ' response to warming must also include the potential impact of insufficient chilling . When collected at continental scale , plant specie phenological data can be used to extract information relating to the combined impact of warming and reduced chilling on plant specie physiology . In this brief study , we demonstrate that common lilac first leaf and first bloom phenology ( collected from multiple location in the western United States and matched with air temperature record ) can estimate the specie ' chilling requirement ( 1748 chilling hour , base 7.2 degree C ) and highlight the changing impact of warming on the plant 's phenological response in light of that requirement . Specifically , when chilling is above the requirement , lilac first leaf/first bloom date advance at a rate of -5.0/-4.2 day per 100-h reduction in chilling accumulation , while when chilling is below the requirement , they advance at a much reduced rate of -1.6/-2.2 day per 100-h reduction . With continental-scale phenology data being collected by the USA National Phenology Network ( http : //www.usanpn.org ) , these and more complex ecological question related to warming and chilling can be addressed for other plant specie in future study .

aVStratospheric water vapor concentration decreased by about 10 % after the year 2000 . Here we show that this acted to slow the rate of increase in global surface temperature over 2000-2009 by about 25 % compared to that which would have occurred due only to carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas . More limited data suggest that stratospheric water vapor probably increased between 1980 and 2000 , which would have enhanced the decadal rate of surface warming during the 1990s by about 30 % a compared to estimate neglecting this change . These finding show that stratospheric water vapor is an important driver of decadal global surface climate change .

aVPeople often suffer from the intense summer heat in Japan . This trend is increasing in urban area because of the heat island effect and global warming . We evaluated the effect of pavement made of traditional and new material on water and heat budget . We expanded the NICE ( NIES Integrated Catchment-based Eco-hydrology ) model to simulate the water and heat budget for the various material and to reproduce the cooling of water-holding pavement ( consisting of porous asphalt and water-holding filler made of steel by-product based on a silica compound ) by evaporation ( NICE-URBAN ) ; the result were compared with those from the simplified empirical model . NICE-URBAN simulated the cooling of water-holding pavement during the intense heat of summer in an urban area more correctly than the empirical model . Because the model estimate that the air temperature above the water-holding pavement is 1-2 degree C lower than that above the lawn and 3-5 degree C lower than that above the building rooftop , this material ha a powerful positive cooling effect in combination with a lawn for a passive cooling effect . The simulation of NICE-URBAN showed that the surface temperature decrease in water-holding pavement is closely related to evaporation from the surface , the water volume of the pavement and the surface reflectance . The procedure used to integrate the model simulation with land use planning to effectively select and use ecosystem service site is a very powerful approach to create thermally pleasing environment in a megalopolis .

aVChanges from coral to macroalgal dominance following disturbance to coral symbolize the global degradation of coral reef . The development of effective conservation measure depends on understanding the cause of such phase shift . The prevailing view that coral-macroalgal phase shift commonly occur due to insufficient grazing by fish is based on correlation with overfishing and inference from model and small-scale experiment rather than on long-term quantitative field study of fish community at affected and resilient site . Consequently , the specific characteristic of herbivorous fish community that most promote reef resilience under natural condition are not known , though this information is critical for identifying vulnerable ecosystem . In this study , 11 year of field survey recorded the development of the most persistent coral-macroalgal phase shift ( > 7 year ) yet observed on Australia 's Great Barrier Reef ( GBR ) . This shift followed extensive coral mortality caused by thermal stress ( coral bleaching ) and damaging storm . Comparisons with two similar reef that suffered similar disturbance but recovered relatively rapidly demonstrated that the phase shift occurred despite high abundance of one herbivore functional group ( scraping/excavating parrotfish : Labridae ) . However , the shift wa strongly associated with low fish herbivore diversity and low abundance of algal browser ( predominantly Siganidae ) and grazers/detritivores ( Acanthuridae ) , suggesting that one or more of these factor underpin reef resilience and so deserve particular protection . Herbivorous fish are not harvested on the GBR , and the phase shift wa not enhanced by unusually high nutrient level . This show that unexploited population of herbivorous fish can not ensure reef resilience even under benign condition and suggests that reef could lose resilience under relatively low fishing pressure . Predictions of more severe and widespread coral mortality due to global climate change emphasize the need for more effective identification and protection of ecosystem component that are critical for the prevention of coral reef phase shift .

aVIt is becoming apparent that the correlation of cloud at different altitude with cosmic ray and solar activity is a matter of complexity . Specifically , evidence ha been presented favouring particular region of the Earth having positive or negative correlation of cloud cover with respect to cosmic ray and to solar irradiation . In this work we examine the evidence critically from several standpoint and conclude that the evidence for a negative correlation of low and a positive correlation for middle cloud cover with solar irradiance ( a measured by UV ) over a significant fraction of the Earth ( 20-30 % ) is good . No other claimed correlation are Supported . ( C ) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVWetlands are important and restricted habitat for dependent biota and play vital role in landscape function , hydrology and carbon sequestration . They are also likely to be one of the most sensitive component of the terrestrial biosphere to global climate change . An understanding of relationship between wetland persistence and climate is imperative for predicting , mitigating and adapting to the impact of future climate change on wetland extent and function . We investigated whether mire wetland had contracted , expanded or remained stable during 1960-2000 . We chose a study area encompassing a regional climatic gradient in southeastern Australia , specifically to avoid confounding effect of water extraction on wetland hydrology and extent . We first characterized trend in climate by examining data from local weather station , which showed a slight increase in precipitation and marked decline in pan evaporation over the relevant period . Remote sensing of vegetation boundary showed a marked lateral expansion of mire during 1961-1998 , and a corresponding contraction of woodland . The spatial pattern in vegetation change were consistent with the regional climatic gradient and showed a weaker co-relationship to fire history . Resource exploitation , wildland fire and autogenic mire development failed to explain the observed expansion of mire vegetation in the absence of climate change . We therefore conclude that the extent of mire wetland is likely to be sensitive to variation in climatic moisture over decadal time scale . Late 20th-century trend in climatic moisture may be related primarily to reduced irradiance and/or reduced wind speed . In the 21st century , however , net climatic moisture in this region is projected to decline . As mire are apparently sensitive to hydrological change , we anticipate lateral contraction of mire boundary in coming decade a projected climatic drying eventuates . This raise concern about the future hydrological function , carbon storage capacity and unique biodiversity of these important ecosystem .

aVArctic fauna is undergoing significant alteration in response to global climate change , yet we know little regarding the factor that determine specie assemblage at northern latitude . We used a latitudinal transect to ass environmental determinant of ground-dwelling spider assemblage across the boreal forest-tundra transition at a regional scale . Using multivariate technique , we tested 3 complementary hypothesis regarding the factor that best explain pattern of assemblage structure . We predicted that spider assemblage would respond most strongly to vegetation composition and structure and that climate and spatial variable would explain le of the variation in the data . We sampled ground dwelling spider using pitfall trap placed at 36 site along the latitudinal transect . We constructed 3 separate matrix of spatial , climate , and vegetation variable , with each matrix representing a hypothesis . We used redundancy analysis with variation partitioning to determine which matrix of environmental variable best explained pattern in a matrix of spider abundance . We then used a separate redundancy analysis to determine which environmental variable best explained the variation in measure of specie richness and activity density . We collected a total of 2890 individual spider representing 103 specie , 58 genus , and 13 family . Our analysis support the hypothesis that vegetation composition and it related structure best explain pattern in northern spider assemblage at a regional scale .

aVA field campaign wa undertaken over a rice paddy in Central Taiwan to investigate the flux of CH ( 4 ) through the flux-gradient method . During the campaign period , the average observed concentration of CH ( 4 ) during the campaign period at the lower height ( 22.2 m above ground level , agl ) and upper height ( 27.5 m agl ) were around 2.04 ppm and 2.01 ppm , respectively . It wa noticed that the profile concentration of CH ( 4 ) wa lower during day time when compared to night time . However , the flux of CH ( 4 ) wa observed to be higher during the day time than during night hour . In order to understand the relationship between the influence of meteorological variable on the flux of CH ( 4 ) , six meteorological variable were studied . It wa observed that soil heat flux ha a linear positive correlation with the flux of CH ( 4 ) . During the study period , the maturity stage of rice paddy , the rice paddy ecosystem wa behaving a source of CH ( 4 ) and CO ( 2 ) . Over a 100-year time frame , the global warming potential ( GWP ) flux of CH ( 4 ) and CO ( 2 ) observed at this study site were 0.16 and 0.71 mu mol CO ( 2 ) equivalent m ( -2 ) s ( -1 ) , respectively . The total GWP flux ( CH ( 4 ) and CO ( 2 ) ) wa 0.86 mu mol CO ( 2 ) equivalent m ( -2 ) s ( -1 ) in which CH ( 4 ) and CO ( 2 ) contribute 18 % and 82 % , respectively . ( C ) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

aVIncreases of global temperature have resulted in measurable shift in the distribution , phenology and survival of some plant and animal specie . However , the mechanism showing link between global warming and biodiversity decline remain unclear . The aim of this study wa to examine whether a key parameter of fitness , i.e . offspring number , could be affected by a temperature increase . To this end , we compared egg-laying trait at naturally occurring temperature ( 14 degree C , 18 degree C and 22 degree C ) in palmate newt , Lissotriton helveticus . Our study suggests that water temperature increase ha a negative effect on the fecundity of female newt . Females lay half a many egg at high temperature a they do at low temperature , which result in a lower number of hatchling . This study show that global warming would affect amphibian population . It complement other study in pointing out that change in phenology may not be driven only by warmer earlier temperature but also by counter-selection during late-breeding , particularly in long-term breeder such a newt . More experimental study should be carried out to understand the complex consequence of global warming and the proximate mechanism of amphibian decline . ( C ) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS .

aVGlobal climate change will influence environmental condition including temperature , surface radiation , soil moisture , and sea level , and it will also significantly impact regional-scale hydrologic process such a evapotranspiration ( ET ) , precipitation , runoff , and snowmelt . The quantity and quality of water available for drinking and other domestic usage is also likely to be affected by change in these process . Consequently , it is necessary to ass and reflect upon the challenge ahead for water infrastructure and the general public in metropolitan region . One approach to the problem is to use index-based assessment , forecasting and planning . The drought index previously developed were not developed for domestic water supply , and thus are insufficient for the purpose of such an assessment . This paper aim to propose and develop a `` Metropolitan Water Availability Index ( MWAI ) '' to ass the status of both the quantity and quality of available potable water source diverted from the hydrologic cycle in a metropolitan region . In this approach , the accessible water may be expressed a volume per month or week ( i.e. , m ( 3 ) /month or m ( 3 ) /week ) relative to a prescribed historical record , and such a trend analysis may result in final MWAI value ranging from 1 to +1 for regional water management decision making . The MWAI computation us data and information from both historical point measurement and spatial remote-sensing based monitoring . Variables such a precipitation , river discharge , and water quality change at drinking water plant intake at specific location are past `` point '' measurement in MWAI calculation . On the other hand , remote sensing provides information on both spatial and temporal distribution of key variable . Examples of remote-sensing image and sensor network technology are in-situ sensor network , ground-based radar , air-borne aircraft , and even space-borne satellite . A case study in Tampa Bay , Florida is described to demonstrate the short-term assessment of the MWAI concept at a practical level . It is anticipated that such a forecasting methodology may be extended for middle-term and long-term water supply assessment . ( C ) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVCoral community from the Central Mexican Pacific have suffered regional bleaching a a consequence of temperature anomaly stemming from EI Nino Southern Oscillation event and local event . Due to these and other impact , there is an urgent need to better understand the physiological response of reef coral to change in their external environment . In this study , we measured lipid content and endosymbiont density in colony of the common , reef-building coral Pocillopora verrucosa in order to gauge their response to thermal stress , in particular , over a multi-month time span . Colonies were collected from different depth and different site in the same area in three different period . In coral colony from the southern site , both marker varied temporally over the course of the year , though no variation wa found between colony from different depth . In colony from the northern site , total lipid content varied significantly between depth and over time . The northern colony which had been seriously affected by the cold water bleaching appear to be more sensitive to stress event than those from the southern site , which demonstrated an acclimatization response to the elevated temperature to which they were exposed . And also different colony were collected and acclimatized in laboratory aquarium and exposed to thermal stress ( 28 and 31 degree C ) . Only colony exposed to 31 degree C experienced a significant decrease in total lipid content within their cell . Likewise , these colony also demonstrated a statistically significant 82 % reduction in density of endosymbiotic dinoflagellate ( genus Symbiodinium ) . A better understanding of the ability of coral to acclimatize to different temperature regime will allow manager to target particular reef ecosystem for enhanced protection under future period of thermal stress , namely those expected to be brought on by global climate change .

aVThe Arctic Ocean is undergoing change at an unprecedented rate because of global climate change . Especially poorly-studied in arctic water are the gelatinous zooplankton , which are difficult to study using traditional oceanographic method . A distinct zooplanktivore community wa characterized in the surface 100 m by use of a Remotely Operated Vehicle , net collection , and SCUBA diving . The large scyphomedusa , Chrysaora melanaster , wa associated with the warm Pacific water at similar to 35-75 m depth . A diverse ctenophore community lived mainly above the C. melanaster layer , including Dryodora glandula , a specialized predator of larvacean , Beroe cucumis , a predator of other ctenophore , and the extremely fragile Bolinopsis infundibulum , which wa the most abundant specie . Gut content analysis showed that Mertensia ovum selectively consumed the largest copepod ( Calanus spp . ) and amphipod ( Parathemisto libellula ) : B. infundibulum consumed smaller copepod and pteropods ( Limacina helicina ) . Large copepod were digested by M. ovum in similar to 12 h at -1.5 to 0 degree C , but by B. infundibulum in only similar to 4 h. We estimated that M. ovum consumed an average of similar to 2 % d ( -1 ) of the Calanus spp . copepod and that B. infundibulum consumed similar to 4 % d ( -1 ) of copepod < 3 mm prosome length . These are significant consumption rate given that Calanus spp . have life-cycles of 2 or more year and are eaten by vertebrate including bowhead whale and arctic cod . ( C ) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

aVCentral and semiarid north-eastern Asia wa subject to twentieth century warming far above the global average . Since forest of this region occur at their drought limit , they are particularly vulnerable to climate change . We studied the regional variation of temperature and precipitation trend and their effect on tree growth and forest regeneration in Mongolia . Tree-ring series from more than 2,300 tree of Siberian larch ( Larix sibirica ) collected in four region of Mongolia 's forest zone were analyzed and related to available weather data . Climate trend underlie a remarkable regional variation leading to contrasting response of tree growth in taiga forest even within the same mountain system . Within a distance of a few hundred kilometer ( 140-490 km ) , area with recently reduced growth and regeneration of larch alternated with region where these parameter remained constant or even increased . Reduced productivity could be correlated with increasing summer temperature and decreasing precipitation ; improved growth condition were found at increasing precipitation , but constant summer temperature . An effect of increasing winter temperature on tree-ring width or forest regeneration wa not detectable . Since decline of productivity and regeneration are more widespread in the Mongolian taiga than the opposite trend , a net loss of forest is likely to occur in the future , a strong increase in temperature and regionally differing change in precipitation are predicted for the twenty-first century .

aVWith threat to biodiversity posed by anthropogenic impact and global climate change , characterization of existing flora and fauna is increasingly important , but continues to focus predominantly on easily studied taxon . In the Southern Ocean , level of specie richness remain relatively unexplored due to remoteness and difficulty of sampling the region . Nemerteans ( proboscis worm ; ribbon worm ) are unusually abundant and occasionally conspicuous in the Antarctic region . Despite being routinely collected , difficulty in preserving voucher material , morphological limitation , and shortage of taxonomic expertise have hindered our understanding of nemertean diversity . To ass pattern of diversity , we examined a fragment of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene from larval and adult nemertean ( n = 192 ) from 53 site along the western Antarctic Peninsula . We found 20 distinct lineage having an uncorrected genetic distance ( p ) greater than 5 % to the nearest sister taxon or group , 19 of which have not been genetically characterized in previous study . Additionally , the putatively dominant adult specie in the region , Parborlasia corrugatus , wa found to comprise only 4.3 % of larva sampled ( n = 3 out of 69 sample from 12 location ) . Of 47 nemertean specie recorded from Antarctic water , 20 are heteronemerteans and therefore could have a pelagic pilidium larval phase . These result suggest that Antarctic biodiversity is underestimated , and that unknown specie of nemertean await description from Southern Ocean water .

aVEcologists increasingly suspect that climate change will directly impact specie physiology . demography , and phenology , but also indirectly affect these measure Via change to the Surrounding community . Unfortunately , few study examine both the direct and indirect pathway of impact . Doing so is important because altered competitive pressure can reduce or magnify the direct response of a focal specie to climate change . Here . we examine the effect of changing rainfall on three rare annual plant specie in the presence and absence of competition on the California Channel Islands . We used rain-out shelter and hand watering to exclude and augment early , late , and season-long rainfall , spanning the wide range of precipitation change forecast for the region . In the absence of competition , drought reduced the population growth rate of two of three Cocal annual , while increased rainfall wa only sometimes beneficial . As compared to the focal specie , the dominant competitor were more sensitive to the precipitation treatment , benefiting from increased season-long precipitation and harmed by drought . Importantly , the response of two of three competitor to the precipitation treatment tended to be positively correlated with those of the focal annual . Although this lead to the expectation that increased competition will counter the direct benefit of favorable condition , such indirect effect of precipitation change proved weak to nonexistent in our experiment . Competitors had little influence on the precipitation response of two focal specie , due to their low sensitivity to competition and highly variable precipitation response . Competition did affect low our third focal specie responded to precipitation change , but this effect only approached significance , and whether it truly resulted from competitor response to precipitation change wa unclear . Our work suggests that even , when competitor respond to climate change , these response may have little effect on the focal specie . Ultimately , the strength of the indirect effect depends on how strongly climate change alters competition . and how sensitive focal specie are to change in competition .

aVPredictions of effect of global climate change include decreased runoff for many part of the world , which will result in drying of stream . Information of the effect of drought on aquatic ecosystem is limited and little is known of the effect on ecosystem function . Our main objective wa to measure the direct effect of drought on leaf litter breakdown by invertebrate shredder in a controlled laboratory experiment . We hypothesized a decreased breakdown at high drought level . Single-species and multi-species treatment with three shredder specie ( Asellus aquaticus , Limnephilus bipunctatus , and L. flavicornis ) were set up in an experiment with three drought level treatment , control , medium , and high drought ( 6 cm water level , 1 cm water level , and water level below sediment surface , respectively ) . Breakdown measured a leaf litter loss wa significantly lower in both medium and high drought treatment compared to the control . Previously , decreased breakdown due to drying ha been reported , but attributed to low density of invertebrate shredder . We show that even when shredder are present , drought decrease the breakdown . Drought treatment also induced earlier pupation for the caddisfly L. flavicornis . Shifts in specie phenology due to drought , e.g. , earlier emergence , may affect specie ability to adult survival and reproduction . Shifts in timing of emergence may also affect terrestrial food web , where emerging aquatic insect may constitute an important food subsidy . Our knowledge of the complex effect of drought in aquatic system is limited with an urgent need of extended knowledge of the ecological effect of drought on freshwater ecosystem functioning .

aVTemporary river are characterized by recurrent dry phase , and global warming will stress their hydrology by amplifying extreme event . Microbial degradation and transformation of organic matter ( OM ) in riverbed sediment are key process with regard to carbon and nutrient flux . In this study , we describe structural and functional change of benthic microbial community in a riverine environment subject to hydrological fluctuation . Sampling wa carried out in the outlet section of the Mulargia River ( Sardinia , Italy ) under various water regime , including one flood event . Overall , sediment were characterized by low bacterial cell abundance ( range 0.6-1.8 x 10 ( 9 ) cell g ( -1 ) ) a a consequence of their low nutrient and OM concentration . No major difference were found in the community composition . Alpha-Proteobacteria dominated during the whole year ( range 21-30 % ) followed by Beta-Proteobacteria , Gamma-Proteobacteria , and Cytophaga-Flavobacteria which always contributed < 18 % . Planctomycetes and Firmicutes were found in smaller amount ( < 7 % ) . In spring , when the highest total organic carbon content wa also detected ( 0.42 % w/w ) , both bacterial abundance and C production ( BCP , 170 nmol C h ( -1 ) g ( -1 ) ) reached relatively high value . During the flood event , an increase in BCP and the highest value of community respiration ( CR , 74 nmol C h ( -1 ) g ( -1 ) ) were observed . Moreover , most of the extracellular enzyme activity ( EEA ) changed significantly during the flood . The variation of the water flow itself can explain part of these change and other factor also come into play . The presence of different pattern of functional parameter could suggest that the quality of the OM could be the major driving force in nutrient flux .

aVRelationships among global warming potential ( GWP ) , farmland surplus nitrogen ( FSN ) and income for major land us in the Ikushunbetsu watershed were compared using the eco-balance method . An empirical model wa created for carbon dioxide , methane and nitrous oxide for both upland and paddy rice using monitoring data from 22 field . The greenhouse gas emission were converted into GWP , whereas yield and FSN were obtained from interview with farmer and a literature survey . Land use distribution wa obtained by ground survey in 2002 , 2005 and 2007 . The analysis showed that paddy rice and soybean were characterized by a high GWP , low FSN and high income , whereas onion and vegetable had a high FSN but low GWP and moderate income . Wheat showed a negative GWP in some year , and abandoned area always exhibited negative value . The total GWPs for the region were 14,184 , 11,085 and 8,337 Mg CO ( 2 ) year ( -1 ) for 2002 , 2005 and 2007 , respectively . The contribution of paddy rice to GWP wa highest , ranging from 40 to 75 % . To find optimal land use combination that provide higher income and lower GWPs and FSNs than at present , all possible land use combination were analyzed by changing the land use proportion from 0 to 100 % at an interval of 10 % . The number of land use combination meeting the requirement in the three investigated year wa 205 . Abandoned area , which had the smallest environmental load , wa included in every land use combination , indicating that land us with low environmental impact should be maintained at a certain proportion to mitigate the environmental load accompanying land us with high production .

aVDesign process determines 80 % of the whole environmental impact generated by a product or service . This paper intends to describe a simplified renewed procedure for the analysis and selection of material capable of providing fast and reliable information to those designer that are interested to minimize the life-cycle environmental burden of product and service , the so called EcoAudit . The here presented EcoAudit procedure ass the burden associated to a component/product by mean of a customized set of environmental impact indicator , without exploring all parameter that are usually provided by a LCA study . The set of environmental impact indicator that are here adopted for this purpose are the energy consumption ( energy breakdown in term of direct and indirect contributor , MJ per functional unit ) , the global warming potential ( in term of CO ( 2 ) equiv per functional unit ) and the end of life possibility ( in term of effective practicable scenario , i.e . of recycling ) . The first two indicator may be intended a `` key environmental performance indicator '' ( `` KEPIs '' ) . This approach allows a fast preliminary ranking of material and process identifying the most relevant critical phase of a system , making the ecodesign process really starting . The integration within the Cambridge Engineering Selector 2009 EcoAudit tool allows to search and browse material data , calculating the environmental load in a real time .

aVDetermining the relative importance of local and regional process for the distribution of population abundance is a fundamental but contentious issue in ecology . In marine system , classical theory hold that the influence of demographic process and dispersal is confined to local population whereas the environment control regional pattern of abundance . Here , we use spatial synchrony to compare the distribution of population abundance of the dominant mussel Mytilus californianus observed along the West Coast of the United States to that predicted by dynamical model undergoing different dispersal and environmental treatment to infer the relative influence of local and regional process . We reveal synchronized fluctuation in the abundance of mussel population across a whole continent despite limited larval dispersal and strong environmental forcing . We show that dispersal among neighboring population interacts with local demographic process to generate characteristic pattern of spatial synchrony that can govern the dynamic distribution of mussel abundance over 1,800 km of coastline . Our study emphasizes the importance of dispersal and local dynamic for the distribution of abundance at the continental scale . It further highlight potential limit to the use of `` climate envelope '' model for predicting the response of large-scale ecosystem to global climate change .

aVInfluenza A virus infection result in similar to 500,000 human death per year and many more sublethal infection . Wild bird are recognized a the ancestral host of influenza A virus , and avian virus have contributed genetic material to most human virus , including subtypes H5N1 and H1N1 . Thus , influenza virus transmission in wild and domestic animal and human is intimately connected . Here we review how anthropogenic change , including human population growth , land use , climate change , globalization of trade , agricultural intensification , and change in vaccine technology may alter the evolution and transmission of influenza virus . Evidence suggests that viral transmission in domestic poultry , spillover to other domestic animal , wild bird and human , and the potential for subsequent pandemic spread , are all increasing . We highlight four area in need of research : driver of viral subtype dynamic ; ecological and evolutionary determinant of transmissibility and virulence in bird and human ; the impact of changing land use and climate on host , virus , and transmission ; and the impact of influenza virus on wild bird host , including their ability to migrate while shedding virus .

aVTerrestrial ecosystem gain carbon through photosynthesis and lose it mostly in the form of carbon dioxide ( CO ( 2 ) ) . The extent to which the biosphere can act a a buffer against rising atmospheric CO ( 2 ) concentration in global climate change projection remains uncertain at the present stage ( 1-4 ) . Biogeochemical theory predicts that soil nitrogen ( N ) scarcity may limit natural ecosystem response to elevated CO ( 2 ) concentration , diminishing the CO ( 2 ) -fertilization effect on terrestrial plant productivity in unmanaged ecosystem ( 3-7 ) . Recent model have incorporated such carbon-nitrogen interaction and suggest that anthropogenic N source could help sustain the future CO ( 2 ) -fertilization effect ( 8,9 ) . However , conclusive demonstration that added N enhances plant productivity in response to CO ( 2 ) -fertilization in natural ecosystem remains elusive . Here we manipulated atmospheric CO ( 2 ) concentration and soil N availability in a herbaceous brackish wetland where plant community composition is dominated by a C ( 3 ) sedge and C ( 4 ) grass , and is capable of responding rapidly to environmental change ( 10 ) . We found that N addition enhanced the CO ( 2 ) -stimulation of plant productivity in the first year of a multi-year experiment , indicating N-limitation of the CO ( 2 ) response . But we also found that N addition strongly promotes the encroachment of C ( 4 ) plant specie that respond le strongly to elevated CO ( 2 ) concentration . Overall , we found that the observed shift in the plant community composition ultimately suppresses the CO ( 2 ) -stimulation of plant productivity by the third and fourth year . Although extensive research ha shown that global change factor such a elevated CO ( 2 ) concentration and N pollution affect plant specie differently ( 11-13 ) , and that they may drive plant community change ( 14-17 ) , we demonstrate that plant community shift can act a a feedback effect that alters the whole ecosystem response to elevated CO ( 2 ) concentration . Moreover , we suggest that trade-off between the ability of plant taxon to respond positively to different perturbation may constrain natural ecosystem response to global change .

aVIodotrifluoromethane ( CF ( 3 ) I ) gas is one of the environmentally conscious perfluorocarbon gas because it ha a very low global warming potential . The author have found that CF ( 3 ) I gas plasma drastically reduces ultraviolet ( UV ) photon irradiation of similar to 4.0 eV , which corresponds to the excitation energy at silicon dioxide ( SiO ( 2 ) ) /silicon ( Si ) interface , in comparison with octafluorocyclobutane ( C ( 4 ) F ( 8 ) ) gas . This result in reducing UV irradiation damage in dielectric film etching process , which wa experimentally confirmed by evaluating charge-pumping current in metal insulator semiconductor field effect transistor fabricated by using CF ( 3 ) I gas etching . They have also demonstrated that a novel etching method using pulse-time modulation of CF ( 3 ) I gas plasma for the first time further reduced UV light irradiation damage .

aVThe effect of model resolution on projected climatological feature of tropical cyclone ( TCs ) wa investigated via 25-year present-day and future global warming projection using the Japan Meteorological Agency/Meteorological Research Institute Atmospheric General Circulation Model with four resolution ranging from TL95 ( 180-km mesh ) to TL959 ( 20-km mesh ) . The finest resolution ( TL959 ) showed the highest skill in term of TC intensity and interannual and seasonal variation in TC genesis number . Resolutions of TL319 ( 60-km mesh ) and finer showed a significant future increase in the frequency of intense TCs , whereas resolution coarser than TL319 showed no such change , indicating that TL319 is the critical resolution in projecting future change in the frequency of intense TCs . Overall , high model resolution is preferable for realistic and reliable climate projection . Resolutions of TL159 ( 120-km mesh ) and finer showed similar skill , bias , and future change in the spatial pattern of TC genesis frequency ( TGF ) and TC genesis number , indicating the potential use of lower model resolution for minimizing uncertainty in future change in the mean state of TGF and TC genesis number .

aVA field experiment wa conducted for two year on a sandy loam ( Typic Ustochrept ) soil of Punjab to study the effect of organic material and rice cultivar on methane emission from rice field . The methane flux varied between 0.04 and 0.93 mg m ( 2 ) hr ( -1 ) in bare soil and transplanting of rice crop doubled the methane flux ( 0.07 to 2.06 mg m ( -2 ) hr ( -1 ) ) . Among rice cultivar , significantly ( p < 0.05 ) higher amount of methane wa emitted from Pusa 44 compared to PR 118 and PR 111 . Application of organic material enhanced methane emission from rice field and resulted in increased soil organic carbon content . The greatest seasonal methane flux wa observed in wheat straw amended plot ( 229.6 kg ha ( -1 ) ) followed by farmyard manure ( 111.6 kg ha ( -1 ) ) , green manure ( 85.4 kg ha ( -1 ) ) and the least from rice straw compost amended plot ( 36.9 kg ha ( -1 ) ) a compared to control ( 21.5 kg ha ( -1 ) ) . The differential effect of organic material in enhancing methane flux wa related to total carbon or C : N ratio of the material . The result showed that incorporation of humified organic matter such a rice straw compost could minimize methane emission from rice field with co-benefits of increased soil fertility and crop productivity

aVA future increase in heavy precipitation event is predicted in boreal region . An irrigation experiment wa conducted in Taiga forest in eastern Siberia to evaluate the effect of heavy precipitation on greenhouse gas ( [ GHG ] CO ( 2 ) , CH ( 4 ) , and N ( 2 ) O ) flux in the soil . The GHG flux on the soil surface were measured using a closed-chamber method and GHG production rate in the mineral soil were estimated using the concentration-gradient method based on Fick 's law . Irrigation water ( 20 mm day-1 ) wa applied continuously for 6 day ( 120 mm in total ; the same amount a summer precipitation in this region ) . Greenhouse gas production rate in the organic layer ( O-layer ) were defined a the difference between the GHG flux and the GHG production rate in the mineral soil . Carbon dioxide flux wa measured both in root-intact ( R ( s ) ) and trenched plot ( R ( mw ) ) . The root respiration rate ( R ( r ) ) wa calculated a the difference between R ( s ) and R ( mw ) . Considering the root distribution in the soil , we regarded the CO ( 2 ) production rate in the mineral soil to be the microbial respiration rate in the mineral soil ( R ( mm ) ) and microbial respiration rate in the O-layer ( R ( mo ) ) a the difference between R ( mw ) and R ( mm ) . Irrigation increased both soil temperature and moisture in the irrigated plot . The R ( s ) , CH ( 4 ) flux and N ( 2 ) O flux during the irrigation period were higher in the irrigated plot than that in the non-irrigated plot ( P < 0.05 ; mean R ( s ) +/- standard deviation [ SD ] ( mg C m-2 h-1 ) were 171 +/- 20 and 109 +/- 11 , mean CH ( 4 ) flux +/- SD ( mu g C m-2 h-1 ) were -5.4 +/- 4.1 and -14.0 +/- 6.5 , and mean N ( 2 ) O flux +/- SD ( mu g N m-2 h-1 ) were 1.6 +/- 1.6 and 0.2 +/- 1.1 , respectively ) . Soil moisture had a positive effect on R ( mm ) and CH ( 4 ) production rate in the O-layer , a negative effect on R ( r ) , and did not affect R ( mo ) , the CH ( 4 ) production rate in the mineral soil or the N ( 2 ) O production rate in both the O-layer and the mineral soil . Soil temperature had a positive effect on R ( r ) and R ( mo ) . The increment of global warming potential of the soil mainly resulted from an increase in microbial respiration rate . Future change in precipitation pattern in this region would accelerate decomposition of the soil organic matter .

aVThe impact of climate change on schistosomiasis transmission ha attracted considerable attention in recent year . As the intermediate host for schistosome , snail play an obligatory role in schistosomiasis transmission . In order to determine the impact of low temperature on snail survival , we studied crystallization temperature ( Tc ) and lower lethal temperature ( LLT ) of the snail Oncomelania hupensis , the intermediate host of human blood fluke Schistosoma japonicum , under different physiological condition . The mean T c of 'dry ' snail wa -12.79 +/- 1.17 degree C , which is significantly lower than that of 'wet ' snail ( -5.36 +/- 2.11 degree C ) . Survival of 'dry ' snail wa high ( 92 % after 24 h ) when the temperature wa higher than -7 degree C , then decreased rapidly between -7 degree C and -12 degree C ( 92 % to 0 % after 24h ) . LT ( 50 ) between 0.25 h and 24 h exposure wa between -10.8 degree C and -9.4 degree C. Our data suggest that O. hupensis out of water could be avoiding freezing . As winter temperature continue to rise due to global warming , O. hupensis may increase it range , thereby spreading schistosomiasis to the northern part of China .

aVAlthough anthropogenic influence such a global warming , overfishing , and eutrophication may contribute to jellyfish bloom , little is known about the effect of ocean acidification on jellyfish . Most medusa form statoliths of calcium sulfate hemihydrate that are component of their balance organ ( statocysts ) . This study wa designed to test the effect of pH ( 7.9 , within the average current range , 7.5 , expected by 2100 , and 7.2 , expected by 2300 ) combined with two temperature ( 9 and 15A degree C ) on asexual reproduction and statolith formation of the moon jellyfish , Aurelia labiata . Polyp survival wa 100 % after 122 d in seawater in all six temperature and pH combination . Because few polyp at 9A degree C strobilated , and temperature effect on budding were consistent with published result , we did not analyze data from those three treatment further . At 15A degree C , there were no significant effect of pH on the number of ephyrae or bud produced per polyp or on the number of statoliths per statocyst ; however , statolith size wa significantly smaller in ephyrae released from polyp reared at low pH . Our result indicate that A. labiata polyp are quite tolerant of low pH , surviving and reproducing asexually even at the lowest tested pH ; however , the effect of small statoliths on ephyra fitness are unknown .

aVAs global climate change affect recharge and runoff process , stream flow regime are being altered . In the American Southwest , increasing aridity is predicted to cause decline in stream base flow and water table . Another potential outcome of climate change is increased flood intensity . Changes in these stream flow condition may independently affect vegetation or may have synergistic effect . Our goal wa to extrapolate vegetation response to climate-linked stream flow change , by taking advantage of the spatial variation in flow condition over a 200 km length of the San Pedro River ( Arizona ) . Riparian vegetation trait were contrasted between site differing in low-flow hydrology ( degree of stream intermittency ) and flood intensity ( stream power of the 10-year recurrence flood ) . Field data indicate that increased stream intermittency would cause the floodplain plant community to shift from hydric pioneer tree and shrub ( Populus , Salix , Baccharis ) towards mesic specie ( Tamarix ) . This shift in functional type would produce change in vegetation structure , with reduced canopy cover and shorter canopy at drier site . Among herbaceous specie , annual would increase while perennial would decrease . If flood intensity increased , there would be shift towards younger tree age , expansion of xeric pioneer shrub ( in response to flood-linked edaphic change ) , and replacement of herbaceous perennial by annual . Woody stem density would increase and basal area would decrease , reflecting shift towards younger forest . Some effect would be compounded : Annuals were most prevalent , and tree canopy shortest , at site that were dry and intensely flooded . Vegetational change would feedback onto hydrologic and geomorphic process , of importance for modeling . Increased flood intensity would have positive feedback on disturbance process , by shifting plant community towards specie with le ability to stabilize sediment . Feedbacks between riparian vegetation and stream low-flow change would be homeostatic , with reduced evapotranspiration rate ameliorating decline in base flow arising from increased aridity .

aVThe effect of temperature and population density on the growth of Atlantic herring Clupea harengus wa studied using a comparative approach applied to 15 North Atlantic population . The von Bertalanffy ( VB ) equation wa applied to describe mean growth of individual in each population , both averaged over the whole period studied and for each cohort . Water temperature wa a determinant factor for herring growth at the specie level : North Atlantic herring in cold water area exhibited a lower growth coefficient ( k ) , longer lifespan and a higher asymptotic weight ( w ( inf ) ) than those living in warmer water . The average w ( inf ) of herring wa positively correlated to the density of biomass of that population . This relationship wa most likely due to the negative correlation found between population density and mean temperature . At the within-population level , when looking at the temporal variability in growth parameter amongst cohort , w ( inf ) wa still negatively correlated to temperature , but the positive correlation between k and temperature wa no longer significant . In a single population , the temperature range is probably too narrow to have an identifiable effect on growth . The effect may be confounded by other factor such a density dependence . On the basis of this macroecological pattern , global warming should enhance growth of the youngest age-classes , but reduce the growth of older individual and shorten the lifespan of herring .

aVPurpose Soil carbon ( C ) and nutrient pool under different plantation weed control and fertilizer management treatment were assessed in a 7-year-old , F ( 1 ) hybrid ( Pinus elliottii var . elliottii x Pinus caribaea var . hondurensis ) plantation in southeast Queensland , Australia . This research aimed to investigate how early establishment silvicultural treatment would affect weed biomass , soil C , nitrogen ( N ) and other nutrient pool ; and soil C ( delta ( 13 ) C ) and N isotope composition ( delta ( 15 ) N ) to help explain the key soil process regulating the soil C and nutrient pool and dynamic . Materials and method Soils were sampled in June 2006 in both the planting row and in the inter-planting row at three depth ( 0-5 , 5-10 , and 10-20 cm ) . Soil parameter including total and labile C and N pool ; soil delta ( 13 ) C and delta ( 15 ) N ; total phosphorus ( P ) ; extractable potassium ( K ) ; moisture content and weed biomass were investigated . Results and discussion The luxury weed control treatment significantly reduced weed biomass and it organic residue returned to the soil in the first 7 year of plantation development . This resulted in significant variation at some depth and position in soil delta ( 13 ) C , delta ( 15 ) N , extractable K , hot water extractable organic C ( HWEOC ) , hot water extractable total N ( HWETN ) , potentially mineralizable N ( PMN ) , and soil moisture content ( MC ) . Luxury weed control in the absence of luxury fertilization also significantly decreased extractable K. There wa a significant interaction between soil depth and sampling position for soil total C , total N , HWEOC , and HWETN . Weed biomass correlated positively with soil total N , delta ( 13 ) C , PMN , MC , HWEOC , and HWETN . Conclusions Luxury weed control treatment significantly reduced weed biomass leading to a reduction of soil organic matter . Soil delta ( 13 ) C and delta ( 15 ) , together with the other soil labile C and N pool , were sensitive and useful indicator of soil C dynamic and N cycling process in the exotic pine plantation of subtropical Australia .

aVThe post-2012 climate policy framework need a global commitment to deep greenhouse gas emission cut . This paper analyzes reaching ambitious emission target up to 2050 , either -10 % or -50 % from 1990 level , and how the economic burden from mitigation effort could be equitably shared between country . The scenario indicate a large low-cost mitigation potential in electricity and industry , while reaching low emission level in international transportation and agricultural emission might prove difficult . The two effort sharing approach , Triptych and Multistage , were compared in term of equitability and coherence . Both approach produced an equitable cost distribution between country , with least developed country having negative or low cost and more developed country having higher cost . There is , however , no definitive solution on how the cost should be balanced equitably between country . Triptych seems to be yet more coherent than other approach , a it can better accommodate national circumstance . Last , challenge and possible hindrance to effective mitigation and equitable effort sharing are presented . The finding underline the significance of assumption behind effort sharing on mitigation potential and current emission , the challenge of sharing the effort with uncertain future allowance price and how inefficient market might undermine the efficiency of a cap-and-trade system .

aVThe adverse effect of high temperature on the early life stage of anadromous whitefish Coregonus lavaretus were experimentally examined by assessing fertilization success , the percentage of developmental abnormality , cumulative mortality and the rate of embryogenesis across a range of temperature . Temperatures > = 7 degree C increased the proportion of unfertilized and abnormally dividing egg , deformed embryo and consequent mortality . The higher the temperature , the more severe were the effect . When egg were fertilized and constantly incubated at various temperature , the effective level for 50 % of the egg and embryo ( EL50 ) of temperature wa 7.6 degree C at the developmental stage when eye pigmentation wa visible . Fewer developmental abnormality and a lower cumulative mortality rate were observed when embryo were exposed to high temperature from the later , gastrula stage , than from fertilization or the four-cell stage . Irrespective of retarded development in term of day-degrees ( i.e . the sum of daily mean temperature ) , a high incubation temperature reduced the development time of C. lavaretus , leading to earlier hatching , and hatched fry were shorter than at the reference temperature of 4-5 degree C. Global warming will particularly pose risk for stenothermic specie such a C. lavaretus , with early life stage being especially susceptible . Thus , relatively small increase and fluctuation in river water temperature during the spawning season of this anadromous specie may have substantial negative impact on it recruitment and population persistence .

aVElevational pattern of specie richness , local abundance and assemblage structure of rainforest bird of north-eastern Australia were explored using data from extensive standardized survey throughout the region . Eighty-two specie of bird were recorded with strong turnover in assemblage structure across the elevational gradient and high level of regional endemism in the upland . Both specie richness and bird abundance exhibited a humped-shaped pattern with elevation with the highest value being between 600 and 800 m elevation . While much of the variability in specie richness could be explained by the species-area relationship , analysis of net primary productivity ( NPP ) and total daily energy consumption of the bird community ( energy use ) suggest that ecosystem energy flow or constraint may be a significant determinant of specie richness . Species richness is positively correlated with local bird abundance which itself is closely related to total energy use of the bird community . We suggest the hypothesis that lower NPP limit bird abundance and energy use in the upland ( > 500 m ) and that low bird energy use and specie richness in the lowland is limited by a seasonal bottleneck in available primary productivity and/or a specie pool previously truncated by an extinction filter imposed by the almost complete disappearance of rainforest in the lowland during the glacial maximum . We suggest that some of the previously predicted impact of global warming on biodiversity in the upland may be partially ameliorated by increase in NPP because of increasing temperature . However , these relationship are complex and require further data specifically in regard to direct estimate of primary productivity and detailed estimate of energy flow within the assemblage .

aVOne of the most important issue related to sustainability is to reduce the use of fossil fuel due to the reduction in greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emission . Nuclear power result in low carbon emission and is thus important to mitigating the adverse effect of global warming and climate change . However , the downside of nuclear power can not be overlooked , and consequently nuclear power is a controversial issue in many country around the world . Thus an important question concern how people should support nuclear power . Do the climate and energy security benefit of nuclear power outweigh it risk and cost ? Therefore , we use a modified double-bounded contingent valuation model to explore the attitude and the willingness to pay ( WTP ) of a country in order to demonstrate it implication for policy . We confirm that supporter and opponent of nuclear power are balanced both in term of their number and in term of their WTP . The policy implication is that people do not support any dramatic increase or reduction in nuclear power , and that nuclear power should still be an important mean of generating electricity in Taiwan . The current share of nuclear power in electricity generation of 20 % should be maintained in the near future . ( C ) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVAccurate model of temperature-dependent embryonic developmental rate are important to ass the effect of a changing climate on insect life cycle and to suggest method of population management by habitat manipulation . Embryonic development determines the life cycle of many specie of grasshopper , which , in cold climate , spend two winter in the egg stage . Increasing temperature associated with climate change in the subarctic could potentiate a switch to a univoltine life cycle . However , egg hatch could be delayed by maintaining a closed vegetative canopy , which would lower soil temperature by shading the soil surface . Prediapause and postdiapause embryonic developmental rate were measured in the laboratory over a wide range of temperature for Melanoplus borealis Fieber and Melanoplus sanguinipes F. ( Orthoptera : Acrididae ) A model wa fit to the data and used to predict date of egg hatch in the spring and prediapause development in the fall under different temperature regimen . Actual soil temperature were recorded at several location over 5 yr. To simulate climate warming , 2 , 3 , or 4 degree C wa added to each hourly recorded temperature . Results suggest that a 2 , 3 , or 4 degree C increase in soil temperature will result in egg hatching approximate to 3 , 5 , or 7 d earlier , respectively . An increase of 3 degree C would be required to advance prediapause development enough to allow for a portion of the population to be univoltine in warmer year . To simulate shading , 2 and 4 degree C were subtracted from observed temperature . A 4 degree C decrease in temperature could potentially delay hatch by 8 d .

aVThe GHGs emmited by using conventional energy source rapid industrialization and development in hill , are contributing global warming , which ha resulted in melting of glacier located in the state at the rate of 0.3-20 m ( 2 ) per year a per recent study . The shrinking of glacier , which are the main source of water of Himalayan river , can have an adverse impact on the future of hydro-power project , many of which may become non-functional during next 40-50 year if the current trend of melting of glacier continues and the other renewable energy source are required to be tapped to supplement the declining hydro-electricity generation . The energy consumption for cooking , lighting and space heating in the Western Himalayan Indian state of Himachal Pradesh , is highest in the northern India . The fuelwood consumption constitutes about 52 % of the total energy consumption of the state . About 2.7 h per person per trip in the rural area , are spent for the collection of fuelwood mainly during winter . A number of option and potential of renewable energy source for cooking , heating and lighting in the state have been discussed .

aVThe process controlling the carbon flux and carbon storage of the atmosphere , ocean and terrestrial biosphere are temperature sensitive ( 1-4 ) and are likely to provide a positive feedback leading to amplified anthropogenic warming ( 3 ) . Owing to this feedback , at time-scales ranging from interannual to the 20-100-kyr cycle of Earth 's orbital variation ( 1,5-7 ) , warming of the climate system cause a net release of CO ( 2 ) into the atmosphere ; this in turn amplifies warming . But the magnitude of the climate sensitivity of the global carbon cycle ( termed gamma ) , and thus of it positive feedback strength , is under debate , giving rise to large uncertainty in global warming projection ( 8,9 ) . Here we quantify the median gamma a 7.7 p. p. m. v. CO ( 2 ) per degree C warming , with a likely range of 1.7-21.4 p. p. m. v. CO ( 2 ) per degree C. Sensitivity experiment exclude significant influence of pre-industrial land-use change on these estimate . Our result , based on the coupling of a probabilistic approach with an ensemble of proxy-based temperature reconstruction and pre-industrial CO ( 2 ) data from three ice core , provide robust constraint for gamma on the policy-relevant multi-decadal to centennial timescales . By using an ensemble of > 200,000 member , quantification of gamma is not only improved , but also likelihood can be assigned , thereby providing a benchmark for future model simulation . Although uncertainty do not at present allow exclusion of gamma calculated from any of ten coupled carbon-climate model , we find that gamma is about twice a likely to fall in the lowermost than in the uppermost quartile of their range . Our result are incompatibly lower ( P < 0.05 ) than recent pre-industrial empirical estimate of similar to 40 p. p. m. v. CO ( 2 ) per degree C ( ref 6 , 7 ) , and correspondingly suggest similar to 80 % le potential amplification of ongoing global warming .

aVThis paper combine an existing projection of the development of electricity production with a technology-specific environmental assessment . The combination of these two approach , which so far have only been performed separately , allows a discussion about environmental effect of carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) implementation strategy on a national level . The result identify the future role of lignite and hard coal in German power production . The implementation of CCS technology lead to a considerable loss of efficiency . Due to CCS , about 50 million t of lignite will be additionally required in 2030 in comparison to the reference case without CCS in 2010 . Increasing demand , the replacement of old plant and the compensation of efficiency loss lead to highly ambitious expansion rate . In the case of CCS implementation , the global warming potential ( GWP ) can be reduced by up to 70 % . However , other environmental impact increase in part considerably . Compliance with national ceiling for NO ( x ) emission can only be reached by compensation measure in other sector The result of the environmental assessment demonstrate the significant role of the coal composition , coal origin and the required transport . CO ( 2 ) pipeline transport and CO ( 2 ) storage make a fairly minor contribution to the overall environmental impact . ( C ) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVAgricultural application of sewage sludge ha been emotionally discussed in the last decade , because the latter contains organic micropollutants with unknown fate and risk potential . In this work , the reuse of anaerobically digested sludge in agriculture is evaluated from an environmental point of view by using Life Cycle Assessment methodology . More specifically , the potential impact of emerging micropollutants , such a pharmaceutical and personal care product , present in the sludge have been quantified . Four scenario were considered according to the temperature of the anaerobic digestion ( mesophilic or thermophilic ) and the sludge retention time ( 20 or 10 d ) , and they have been compared with the non-treated sludge . From an environmental point of view , the disposal of undigested sludge is not the most suitable alternative , except for global warming due to the dominance ( 65-85 % ) of the indirect emission associated to the electricity use . Nutrient-related direct emission dominate the eutrophication category impact in all the scenario ( > 71.4 % ) , although a beneficial impact related to the avoidance of industrial fertiliser production is also quantified ( up to 6.7 % ) . In term of human and terrestrial toxicity , the direct emission of heavy metal to soil dominate these two impact category ( > 70 % ) , and the contribution of other micropollutants is minimal . Moreover , only six ( Galaxolide , Tonalide , Diazepam , Ibuprofen , Sulfamethoxazole and 17 alpha-ethinyloestradiol ) out of the 13 substance considered are really significant since they account for more than 95 % of the overall micropollutants impact .

aVIn this study the environmental burden of home composting were determined using the life cycle assessment ( LCA ) tool . Data used for the LCA study such a gas emission ( CH ( 4 ) , N ( 2 ) O , NH ( 3 ) and volatile organic compound ( VOCs ) ) , tool and composter characteristic were obtained from an experimental home composting process of leftover of raw fruit and vegetable ( LRFV ) . Stable compost with a high content of nitrogen and organic matter wa obtained . Neither pathogen nor phytotoxic compound were found in the final compost . In relation to gaseous emission , only volatile organic compound ( 0.32 kg VOC/Mg LRFV ) were detected , even though ammonia , methane and nitrous oxide emission were also measured . Regarding environmental burden , the composter wa the major contributor to the total home composting process impact for the impact category of abiotic depletion , ozone layer depletion , and cumulative energy demand . Gaseous emission ( based on our own measurement and literature data ) caused the greatest contribution to the acidification , eutrophication , global warming and photochemical oxidation potential .

aVClothes are often discarded when much of their potential lifetime is left . Many charitable organization therefore collect used clothing and resell it a second-hand clothes for example in Eastern Europe or Africa . In this connection , the question arises whether reusing clothes actually result in a decrease of the environmental burden of the life cycle of clothing . The environmental burden of clothing ha been studied in several study . However , most of these study focus solely on the energy consumption aspect and pay little attention to the potential benefit of diverting used clothing from the waste stream . The aim of the study wa to ass the net environmental benefit brought by the disposal of used clothing through charity who return them for second-hand sale assuming that second-hand clothes to some extent replace the purchase of new clothes . The extent to which second-hand clothes ( SHC ) introduces such a replacement wa investigated applying a methodology in which a questionnaire-based survey wa conducted on more than 200 consumer in second-hand shop . The survey wa done in Sweden and Estonia , and Africa wa included by estimation . Based on the identification of the different profile of the consumer questioned , a methodology wa developed to get a quantitative evaluation of the replacement of new clothes enabled by second-hand clothing consumption . A life cycle assessment wa conducted based on the EDIP methodology . The life cycle impact of clothes that are directly disposed of by incineration were compared with the life cycle impact of clothes that are collected and sorted after consumer use in order to be reused . Two product were assessed : a cotton T-shirt and a pair of polyester ( 65 % ) /cotton ( 35 % ) trouser . The functional unit wa 100 garment in the use stage . Based on the survey result and the methodology applied , the purchase of 100 second-hand garment would save between 60 and 85 new garment dependent of the place of reuse . Based on information about the second-hand clothing activity conducted by Humana People to People in Sweden and Estonia , it wa assumed that over 100 collected item 60 would be reused , 30 recycled in other way , and ten go to final disposal . Using these input , the LCA showed that the collection , processing , and transport of second-hand clothing ha insignificant impact on the environment in comparison to the saving that are achieved by replacing virgin clothing . The reduction of impact resulting from collecting 100 garment for reuse range from 14 % decrease of global warming for the cotton T-shirt to 45 % reduction of human toxicity for the polyester/cotton trouser . The approach applied is a fair way of establishing the net benefit from introducing clothes reuse . Indeed , it enables to take into consideration all the activity connected to reusing clothes , including , for instance , recycling and disposal of the collected clothes not suitable for reuse . In addition , the route followed by the collected clothes have been determined based on real figure . A main assumption concern the estimation of avoided production of new clothes brought by clothes reuse . The method used , based on questionnaire , could be further developed but still suggests an approach on an issue that had not been investigated so far . The result of the study show that clothes reuse can significantly contribute to reducing the environmental burden of clothing . It would be beneficial to apply other method for estimating the avoided production of new clothes in order to check the validity and reliability of the result obtained in the current study . Such further work could include the possible difference in the lifetime of second-hand clothes compared to new clothes .

aVThe main purpose of this paper is to emphasize the importance of including environmental degradation cost in the long-term planning of the Brazilian electricity sector . To this aim , environmental external cost associated to both hydro-power and thermal-power electricity generation are investigated . Monetary valuation methodology are applied and environmental degradation cost , expressed in per kWh of generated energy , are obtained for the main type of generation source of the Brazilian electricity matrix . Both local pollution due to particulate matter emission and global warming effect are assessed . A classification of the source from the point of view of their impact on the environment is given . Degradation cost associated to the installed capacity expansion in the Brazilian electricity sector during the time horizon 2007-2016 are estimated . These resulting cost represent lower boundary damage estimate associated only with the energy to be generated during the period . Results indicate that local pollution caused by a small number of plant could be even more costly to society than global warming and , also , show the importance of considering not only unitary damage cost but the participation of each source on the generated energy during the time horizon , a a guide to planning and policy making .

aVWorldwide , the production of biodegradable and compostable plastic ha steadily grown . In Part 1 ( Khoo et al . 2010 ) , life cycle assessment ( LCA ) wa applied to compare the production stage of a bio-based bag ( made from polyhydroxyalkanoate or bio-plastic ( PHA ) ) with polyethylene plastic bag . The scope of the study is within the context of Singapore and doe not include other type of conventional or bio-based polymer ( e.g. , polylactic acid ( PLA ) , thermoplastic , high-density polyethylene ( HDPE ) , EPS , etc ) . This article ( part 2 ) proposes to investigate the end-of-life option of both bag . For part 2 , the same LCA methodology is used for the investigation . The LCA system for part 2 start with disposal option : ( 1 ) land filling at Singapore 's offshore Semakau Island , ( 2 ) incineration , and the ( 3 ) composting of bio-bag . Two useful product , energy and compost , will be produced from option 2 and 3 , respectively . While the energy from the incineration of both bag are fed back into the LCA production stage , compost from bio-bags can be used a a peat substitute , thus generating carbon dioxide saving from reduced peat production . The end-of-life environmental impact were generated for global warming potential , acidification , and photochemical ozone formation . A landfill impact , based on Singapore 's offshore landfill capacity , wa also generated . Next , the environmental impact of the entire life cycle of both product are calculated for a few scenarios-from cradle-to-grave . The highest end-of-life impact are observed from the land filling of bio-bags . Next highest disposal impact are from incineration , and least of all ( minimal ) from the composting of bio-bags . The greenhouse gas saving from peat substitute derived from the compost material is rather insignificant . Overall , the cradle-to-grave result demonstrates that the environmental burden generated from any of the disposal option are le significant compared to those from both product ' life cycle production stage . Unless plan for energy recovery system are in place , the least preferred route for the disposal of bio-bags are at landfill . From the trend of the final cradle-to-grave result , it can be claimed that the life cycle production of bio-bags from PHA can only be considered a environmentally friendly alternative to conventional plastic bag if clean energy source are supplied throughout it production process . This claim wa in agreement with other LCA work carried out for the life cycle production of PHA , with the supply of energy by corn stover waste or the consideration of wind power supply in the replacement of grid electricity . It wa also observed , however , that some of the result in this article vary from other LCA work carried out by other author . Some of the reason included variation in LCA scope and the different range of material investigated ( PLA , HDPE , and thermoplastic starch ) . Presently , the wide range of LCA work carried out on biodegradable polymer differs considerably in the amount of reported background data and the level of detail concerning the LCA system and production method . A globally accepted a well a concerted effort to describe in detail the life cycle production step involved , disposal option , type of energy supplied to the production chain , for a well-selected range of polymer material should be conducted . Meanwhile , it is recommended that a conservative approach is required in introducing bio-based carrier bag a a solution for solving plastic waste issue . Future LCA investigation should also look into the reuse of carrier bag , which is anticipated to bring much greater environmental and sustainable benefit than the replacement of bio-bags with plastic one .

aVThe use of bio-based product a carrier bag , packaging material , and many other application ha been increasingly replacing conventional polymer product . One of the main driving force of bio-plastic application is the perceived depletion and scarcity of fossil fuel , especially petroleum . However , despite being introduced a an environmentally friendly alternative to plastic made from crude oil , the environmental benefit of bio-plastics remain debatable . This article serf to investigate whether or not bio-based material are environmentally friendlier option compared to plastic and attempt to explain the rationale of the result . The production and disposal of both conventional plastic and bio-plastic carrier bag are investigated using life cycle assessment or LCA . A typical bio-based bag ( made from polyhydroxyalkanoate or PHA ) from the U.S. wa selected to be compared with a locally produced polyethylene plastic ( PP ) bag in Singapore . In the LCA system , the raw material for making polyethylene came from crude oil imported from Middle East and natural gas piped from Natuna gas field . The refinery and PP bag production process are based in Singapore . Bio-bag production wa entirely in the U.S. , and the finished product wa shipped to Singapore . The impact assessment result were generated for global warming potential , acidification , and photochemical ozone formation . Next , normalized result were calculated according to the parameter of Singapore 's annual emission inventory . The total environmental impact of bio-bags showed considerable difference under various energy scenario . When the energy expenditure to make bio-bags are supplied by U.S. electricity mix , the production impact are about 69 % higher , compared to the impact from PP bag . With coal-fired power supply , the production impact from bio-bag production turned out to be about five time greater than those from conventional plastic . The life cycle production impact of PP bag are comparable to bio-bags when the energy supplied to the bio-material production chain is supplied by natural gas . Bio-bags are 80 % more environmentally friendly than plastic bag when clean and renewable energy ( geothermal ) is used throughout it life cycle production stage . By the use of LCA with different energy scenario , this article shed some light on the extent of environmental benefit ( or drawback ) of replacing plastic carrier bag with PHA bag . It wa concluded that the life cycle production of bio-bags can only be considered a environmentally friendly alternative to conventional plastic bag if clean energy source are supplied throughout it production process . It wa also highlighted that the result should not be viewed a a global representative since the case study scope wa for Singapore alone . Additional work by others on different biodegradable and compostable bag vary in result . Some of the complexity of such work lie in what is included or excluded from the scope and the adoption of different environmental impact assessment method . Nevertheless , the author ' attempt to compare the two bag may serve a a basis for identifying the major environmental burden of such material ' life cycle production . Although bio-based product have been mostly regarded a a sustainable solution for replacing petroleum-based polymer , in most case , the amount of resource and energy required to produce them have not been taken into account . Before bio-based plastic can be recommended a a preferred option to plastic , a few challenge have to be overcome . The main issue lie in reducing the energy used in the life cycle production of the bio-material from crop . The environmental benefit and drawback of both material should also be more clearly highlighted by expanding the system boundary to include end-of-life option ; this is carried out in part 2 ( Khoo and Tan , Int J Life Cycle Assess , in press , 2010 ) .

aVThe equity implication of alternative climate policy measure are an essential issue to be considered in the design of future international agreement to tackle global warming . This paper specifically analysis the future path of emission and income distribution and it determinant in different scenario . Whereas our analysis is driven by tool which are typically applied in the income distribution literature and which have recently been applied to the analysis Of CO ( 2 ) emission distribution , a new methodological approach is that our study is driven by simulation run with the popular regionalised optimal growth climate change model RICE99 over the 1995-2105 period . We find that the architecture of environmental policy , the implementation of flexible mechanism and income concentration are key determinant of emission distribution over time . In particular we find a robust positive relationship between measure of inequality in the distribution of emission and income and that their magnitude will essentially depend on technological change .

aVGlobal surface temperature show an increasing trend over the past 100 year . Anthropogenic and natural factor have been invoked to explain this warming , but their relative contribution and the spatial variability remain controversial . Based on a 2650-year temperature record from a stalagmite near Beijing , we explore the possible impact of human activity on the warm season temperature in Beijing since the industrial era using the method of singular spectrum analysis ( SSA ) . The result suggest that the warm season temperature in Beijing under the natural forcing should have an overall decreasing trend for the past 130 year ( 1870 to 2000 AD ) with an amplitude of 0.45 +/- 0.84 degree C , while the instrumental record and stalagmite data show an increase of 1.08 degree C. These imply that human activity would have caused an increase in the warm season temperature of Beijing for about 1.53 +/- 0.84 degree C compared to it natural trend , from 1870 AD to 2000 AD . Our result also suggest that anthropogenic forcing began to significantly influence the temperature since 1870 AD , and the effect further intensified since 1915 AD .

However , the short period in which OMW are produced and the high load of recalcitrant compound , make difficult direct land spreading of raw OMW . Consequently , sustainable biological treatment able to transform OMW into a safe amendment have been progressively developed . In comparison to a standard mineral fertilization , the present work assessed the agronomic performance of two innovative kind of OMW compost , used a fertilizer in Lactuca sativa and Lycopersicon esculentum cultivation trial . Both crop showed yield comparable to control , thus suggesting that most of the nutrient contained in the OMW supported adequately plant growth , even in short-term crop . Six month later OMW application , no significant difference were found in the soil humic content . ( C ) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVThrough it nonlinear dynamic and involvement in past abrupt climate shift the thermohaline circulation ( THC ) represents a key element for the understanding of rapid climate change . The expected THC weakening under global warming is characterized by large uncertainty , and it is therefore of significant importance to identify ocean circulation change over the last century . By applying various statistical technique on two global sea surface temperature datasets two THC-related mode are separated . The first one involves relatively slow adjustment of the whole conveyor belt circulation and ha an interhemispherically symmetric pattern . The second mode is associated with the relatively fast adjustment of the North Atlantic overturning cell and ha the seesaw structure . Based on the separation of these two pattern the author show that the global conveyor ha been weakening since the late 1930s and that the North Atlantic overturning cell suffered an abrupt shift around 1970 . The distinction between the two mode provides also a new frame for interpreting past abrupt climate change .

aVUsing 31-yr data from measurement in a lake that ha experienced change in eutrophication status , I showed that the effect of global warming on chlorophyll a ( Chl a ) -normalized maximum rate of photosynthesis ( P ( max ) : Chl a ) may be positive , nonsignificant , or negative , depending on nutrient availability . The magnitude of P ( max ) : Chl a change in response to warming showed hyperbolic relationship with phosphorus concentration ; it wa positive and constant when total phosphorus ( TP ) in the lake water exceeded 22 mu g P L ( -1 ) ( eutrophic condition ) but wa negative when TP wa lower ( nutrient-poor condition ) , indicating direct negative effect of warming on primary productivity ( PP ) under phosphorus scarcity . Vertically integrated PP response corroborate those of P ( max ) : Chl a . These data also showed long-term seasonal variation in the sensitivity of phytoplankton productivity to temperature . The observed hyperbolic curve strongly suggest that the `` limiting-nutrient cell quota '' -based mechanism reported so far only in laboratory ( by study analyzing temperature-nutrient effect on microalgal growth or photosynthesis ) operates in nature and play a key role in determining phytoplankton response to warming of water . The present finding provide insight on how phytoplankton productivity may respond to future warming in lake of differing eutrophication status .

aVA large proportion of northern peatlands consists of Sphagnum-dominated ombrotrophic bog . In these bog , peat moss ( Sphagnum ) and vascular plant occur in an apparent stable equilibrium , thereby sustaining the carbon sink function of the bog ecosystem . How global warming and increased nitrogen ( N ) deposition will affect the specie composition in bog vegetation is still unclear . We performed a transplantation experiment in which mesocosms with intact vegetation were transplanted southward from north Sweden to north-east Germany along a transect of four bog site , in which both temperature and N deposition increased . In addition , we monitored undisturbed vegetation in control plot at the four site of the latitudinal gradient . Four growing season after transplantation , ericaceous dwarf shrub had become much more abundant when transplanted to the warmest site which also had highest N deposition . As a result ericoid aboveground biomass in the transplanted mesocosms increased most at the southernmost site , this site also had highest ericoid biomass in the undisturbed vegetation . The two dominant Sphagnum specie showed opposing response when transplanted southward ; Sphagnum balticum height increment decreased , whereas S. fuscum height increment increased when transplanted southward . Sphagnum production did not differ significantly among the transplanted mesocosms , but wa lowest in the southernmost control plot . The dwarf shrub expansion and increased N concentration in plant tissue we observed , point in the direction of a positive feedback toward vascular plant-dominance suppressing peat-forming Sphagnum in the long term . However , our data also indicate that precipitation and phosphorus availability influence the competitive balance between Sphagnum , dwarf shrub and graminoids .

aVA new low global warming refrigerant , CF ( 3 ) CF=CH ( 2 ) ( HFO-1234yf ) , ha been developed to replace HFC-134a in automotive air conditioning system . HFC-134a is being phased out in the European Union due to high global warming potential . HFO-1234yf is highly energy efficient , exhibit low toxicity , and can potentially be used in system currently designed for refrigerant HFC-134a with minimal modification . Significant work ha been completed to ass the flammability characteristic of HFO-1234yf . Though it is flammable per ASTM E-681 , it is significantly le so than HFC-152a which ha also been considered a an HFC-134a alternative . HFO-1234yf ha a relatively high lower flammability limit at 6.2 vol % in air Computational Fluid Dynamics ( CFD ) modeling ha shown it is very unlikely the lower flammability limit will be reached when the refrigerant is leaked into the passenger compartment of a vehicle . HFO-1234yf also ha a high minimum ignition energy ( MIE ) from 5,000 to 10,000 mJ which indicates there may be very lbw potential ignition source in a vehicle . It also ha very low burning velocity at 1.5 cm/sec indicating low potential for damage should an ignition occur . Several automotive industry group have completed extensive risk assessment which have concluded HFO-1234yf is safe to use a a refrigerant in vehicle . This article will review flammability test result and challenge that were overcome to measure flammability of a mildly flammable refrigerant a well a CFD modeling work for vehicle leakage scenario .

aVThe use of Earth observation data and technique in the context of disaster management support ha received growing importance in recent year . Due to global climate change the scientific community foresees an increase in both the intensity and frequency of extreme weather event . The high resolution , multi-polarization and multi-incidence angle capability of the radar satellite TerraSAR-X , it quick site access and receiving time open interesting perspective for flood mapping and subsequent assessment of damage . Furthermore , the nearly all-weather capacity of SAR data constitutes it main advantage above optical system for mapping of flood event . The work presented in this paper focus on the development of an object-based classification approach for operational flood extent mapping in near-real time condition using TerraSAR-X data . The object-based methodology is assisted by pixel-based operation and both are implemented in a solution within the eCognition software environment . The final objective is to develop a tool which can be easily used by an interpreter without the need of a profound knowledge of image processing . For this purpose an eCognition based semi-automated solution - a Graphical User Interface with a rule set behind - is set up . This application is tested in various scenario and is further developed in parallel to these test . The overall study clearly demonstrates the potential of TerraSAR-X data and object oriented method for a rapid delineation of flood extent in an operational environment .

aVThe present investigation of the Cenozoic carbonate succession of the Campos Basin , offshore southeastern Brazil , ha resulted in a high resolution biostratigraphic profile of the region based on core and cutting sample . In general , the studied carbonate succession evolved during three depositional stage : 1 ) In the Oligocene a warm period prevailed where temperature-sensitive organism , such a larger benthic foraminifera , coral , algae and arthropod thrived in a reefal setting . Four different benthic foraminiferal biozones ( BF1 - BF4 ) were defined based upon the occurrence of the following foraminiferal assemblage which were dominated by ( BF1 ) lepidocyclinids , ( BF2 ) miogypsinids , ( BF3 ) Miogypsina-Amphistegina , and ( BF4 ) Miogypsina and Heterostegina . These biozones , are equivalent to the P18-P22 planktonic foraminiferal biozones , and reflect temporal change of environmental and ecological condition associated with minor sea level fluctuation . 2 ) The warm period continued through the early Miocene , where coral , bryozoan , rare planktonic foraminifera and larger benthic foraminifera thrived in clear agitated water of a forereefal setting . This period wa represented by two benthic foraminiferal zone , BF5 - BF6 , equivalent to the N4-N7 planktonic foraminiferal biozones . Miogypsinids , Lepidocyclina and Heterostegina dominate BF5 , while attached form growing in a massive branching structure , such a Sporadotrema are prominent in BF6 . 3 ) The third depositional stage is reflected by a rapid deepening of the carbonate facies at the onset of the middle Miocene , coeval with a global warming event , the so-called mid-Miocene Climatic Maximum . This resulted in the replacement of the reefal organism by pelagic sediment containing planktonic foraminifera . The planktonic foraminiferal biozones PF1 and PF2 are equivalent to N8-N12 planktonic foraminiferal biozones , and were present in all well . This rapid sea level change is inferred to be related to a global warming event and related oceanographic change . The high resolution depositional and biostratigraphic scheme put forward here for the Campos Basin will enable a more detailed understanding of the general regional evolution of the economically important Cenozoic carbonate facies that are found off the Atlantic margin of South America , the Caribbean and West Africa .

aVThe use of fossil fuel in transportation is an important topic a a result of growing concern over global warming . Automobile petrol demand ha been of particular interest to researcher and policy-makers , given that the automobile is a major contributor to the enhanced greenhouse effect . This paper forecast Australia 's automobile petrol demand up to the year 2020 based on the best performing forecasting model selected out of eight model . In order to establish way to reduce the demand for petrol , and the consequent by-product of reducing the amount of greenhouse gas emission , we have estimated the impact on CO2 for several potential policy instrument , using Transportation and Environment Strategy Impact Simulator ( an integrated transport , land use and environmental strategy impact simulation programme ) . We find that a carbon tax of AU $ 0.50/kg can reduce automobile kilometre by 5.9 % , resulting in reduced demand for petrol and a reduction in CO2 of 1.5 % .

aVQuestion How strong are climate warming-driven change within mid-elevation forest community ? Observations of plant community change within temperate mountain forest ecosystem in response to recent warming are scarce in comparison to high-elevation alpine and nival ecosystem , perhaps reflecting the confounding influence of forest stand dynamic . Location Jura Mountains ( France and Switzerland ) . Methods We assessed change in plant community composition by surveying 154 Abies alba forest vegetation releves ( 550-1,350 m a.s.l . ) in 1989 and 2007 . Over this period , temperature increased while precipitation did not change . Correspondence analysis ( CA ) and ecological indicator value were used to measure change in plant community composition . Releves in even- and uneven-aged stand were analysed separately to determine the influence of forest stand dynamic . We also analysed change in specie distribution to detect shift along the elevation gradient by focusing on the lowest , central and highest position of lowland and mountain specie altitudinal range . Results We found significant shift along the first CA axis , which reflected a change in plant community composition towards a greater frequency of lowland specie . Analyses of ecological indicator value indicated increase in temperature and light availability in A. alba stand , particularly in even-aged stand . However , no major change in overall specie distribution were found . Conclusions The community-level change are consistent with effect of climate warming and local stand dynamic . Changes in specie distribution were small in comparison to observed local temperature increase , perhaps reflecting dispersal limitation , phenotypic plasticity or microclimatic buffering by the tree canopy . Causality can not rigorously be inferred from such a descriptive study ; however , we suggest that recent warming is now driving plant community change in the climatically more moderate mid-elevation forest setting .

aVIn 2008 and 2009 two paper by Kharecha and Hansen and by Net and Cooper examined possible fossil energy availability and energy consumption scenario and consequence for future climate . The paper yield somewhat similar result regarding atmospheric CO ( 2 ) level , but they reach substantially different conclusion regarding future climate change . Here , we compare their method and result . Our work show that Net and Cooper 's paper significantly underestimate future warming . Net and Cooper conclude that even if all the available fossil fuel would be burned at the maximum possible rate during this century , the consequent warming would cap at le than 1 degree C above the 2000 level . We find that under Net and Cooper 's assumption of an intensive exploitation of fossil fuel - the global temperature in 2100 will likely reach level which would lead to severely damaging long-term impact .

aVElectricity generation is an important source of total CO ( 2 ) emission , which in turn have been found to relate to an acceleration of global warming . Given that many OECD country have to replace substantial portion of their electricity-generating capacity over the next 10-20 year , investment decision today will determine the CO ( 2 ) -intensity of the future energy mix . But by what type of power plant will old ( mostly fossil-fuel-fired ) capacity be replaced ? Given that modern , le carbon-intensive technology are still expensive but can be expected to undergo improvement due to technical change in the near future , they may become more attractive , especially if fossil fuel price volatility make traditional technology more risky . At the same time , technological progress is an inherently uncertain process itself . In this paper , we use a real option model with stochastic technical change and stochastic fossil fuel price in order to investigate their impact on replacement investment decision in the electricity sector . We find that the uncertainty associated with the technological progress of renewable energy technology lead to a postponement of investment . Even the simultaneous inclusion of stochastic fossil fuel price in the same model doe not make renewable energy competitive compared to fossil-fuel-fired technology in the short run based on the data used . This implies that policymakers have to intervene if renewable energy is supposed to get diffused more quickly . Otherwise , old fossil-fuel-fired equipment will be refurbished or replaced by fossil-fuel-fired capacity again , which enforces the lock-in of the current system into unsustainable electricity generation .

aVDaily output from the PRUDENCE ensemble of regional climate simulation for the end of the twentieth and twenty-first century over Europe is used to show that the increasing intensity of the most damaging summer heat wave over Central Europe is mostly due to higher base summer temperature . In this context , base temperature is defined a the mean of the seasonal cycle component for those calendar day when regional heat wave occur and is close , albeit not identical , to the mean temperature for July-August . Although 36-47 % of future Central Europe July and August day at the end of the twenty-first century are projected to be extreme according to the present day climatology , specific change in deseasonalized heat wave anomaly are projected to be relatively small . Instead , change in summer base temperature appear much larger , clearly identifiable and of the same order of magnitude a change in the whole magnitude of heat wave . Our result bear important consequence for the predictability of central European heat wave intensity under global warming condition .

aVThe uncertainty surrounding estimate of future global warming , even given a single scenario for increasing greenhouse gas emission , is unacceptably large and ha not declined substantially over the last three decade . The Quaternary science community is uniquely placed to constrain the array of possible future by providing reconstruction of past climate that can be used , together with instrumental data , to weight the model variant in perturbed physic ensemble , which accept the uncertainty in many of the model parameter . The model which give the best fit with the climate of the past can then be given most weight when projected Into the future . Computing resource have restricted such experiment to relatively simple model , so that information on spatial difference in palaeoclimate could not be fully exploited . Within a few year it will be possible to apply this method to complex general circulation model , so if the Quaternary community act now it will be possible to supply the information that is required The best time period to use is the last one to two thousand year . The wider the range of climate parameter that can be reconstructed , and the wider the range of location , the more constraint will be provided . To be useful , the palaeoclimate reconstruction need to have realistic estimate of uncertainty , so a clear emphasis on replication , calibration and verification will be required .

aVAnthropogenic climate change pose a major threat to global biodiversity with a potential to alter biological interaction at all spatial scale . Amphibians are the most threatened vertebrate and have been subject to increasing conservation attention over the past decade . A particular concern is the pandemic emergence of the parasitic chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis , which ha been identified a the cause of extremely rapid large-scale decline and specie extinction . Experimental and observational study have demonstrated that the host-pathogen system is strongly influenced by climatic parameter and thereby potentially affected by climate change . Herein we project a specie distribution model of the pathogen onto future climatic scenario generated by the IPCC to examine their potential implication on the pandemic . Results suggest that predicted anthropogenic climate change may reduce the geographic range of B. dendrobatidis and it potential influence on amphibian biodiversity .

aVOceanic anoxic event ( OAEs ) record profound change in the climatic and paleoceanographic state of the planet and represent major disturbance in the global carbon cycle . OAEs that manifestly caused major chemical change in the Mesozoic Ocean include those of the early Toarcian ( Posidonienschiefer event , T-OAE , similar to 183 Ma ) , early Aptian ( Selli event , OAE 1a , similar to 120 Ma ) , early Albian ( Paquier event , OAE 1b , similar to 111 Ma ) , and Cenomanian-Turonian ( Bonarelli event , C/T OAE , OAE 2 , similar to 93 Ma ) . Currently available data suggest that the major forcing function behind OAEs wa an abrupt rise in temperature , induced by rapid influx of CO ( 2 ) into the atmosphere from volcanogenic and/or methanogenic source . Global warming wa accompanied by an accelerated hydrological cycle , increased continental weathering , enhanced nutrient discharge to ocean and lake , intensified upwelling , and an increase in organic productivity . An increase in continental weathering is typically recorded by transient increase in the seawater value of ( 87 ) Sr/ ( 86 ) Sr and ( 187 ) Os/ ( 188 ) Os ratio acting against , in the case of the Cenomanian-Turonian and early Aptian OAEs , a longer-term trend to le radiogenic value . This latter trend indicates that hydrothermally and volcanically sourced nutrient may also have stimulated local increase in organic productivity . Increased flux of organic matter favored intense oxygen demand in the water column , a well a increased rate of marine and lacustrine carbon burial . Particularly in those restricted ocean and seaway where density stratification wa favored by paleogeography and significant fluvial input , condition could readily evolve from poorly oxygenated to anoxic and ultimately euxinic ( i.e. , sulfidic ) , this latter state being geochemically the most significant . The progressive evolution in redox condition through phase of denitrification/anammox , through to sulfate reduction accompanied by water column precipitation of pyrite framboids , resulted in fractionation of many isotope system ( e.g. , N , S , Fe , Mo , and U ) and mobilization and incorporation of certain trace element into carbonate ( Mn ) , sulfide , and organic matter . Sequestration of CO ( 2 ) in organic-rich black shale and by reaction with silicate rock exposed on continent would ultimately restore climatic equilibrium but at the expense of massive chemical change in the ocean and over time scale of ten to hundred of thousand of year .

aVIn this paper the problem for establishing the Black sea level trend related to the global climate change is discussed . It is well known that the mean sea level is a close approximation of the geopotential surface geoid ( vertical datum ) , which is the true zero surface for measuring physical elevation . Definition characteristic of geoid surface are considered in two aspect ( geometrical and gravimetric model ) in accordance with the high accuracy and temporal-spatial resolution of modern geodetic measuring technique . The possibility of 'absolute ' sea level change determination using Global Navigation Satellite System ( GNSS ) station collocated to the tide gauge , precise levelling and gravimetric measurement of geodetic point to connect independent geodetic system to a one world reference system are considered . The geodetic measurement in the Black sea region will contribute to the complex study of the World Ocean and open sea , and to find out the correlation between trend estimate obtained from different type of data . Long-term sea level change are statistically significant and it is a matter of future more precise determination of their value . For that purpose it is needed a comprehensive , interdisciplinary research in term of incorporating ancillary data type and various geophysical model a well .

aVThe air pollution control and evaluation ha acquired high importance in the modern world . Depending on the per-manence of the pollutant in the atmosphere , the pollution could be local , regional or global . The contribution of many developing country , such a Cuba , to global climate change is very low . In these case , while providing importance to reducing national emission of greenhouse gas ( GHG ) , the priority action would be addressed to adapting to climate change and to reducing emission that determine local and regional pollution , which have adverse effect , especially on health . The present paper examines Cuba 's contribution to global greenhouse gas emission , which turn out to be modest . Then , the problem of local pollution in the nation is addressed , reporting data from experimental measurement and comparing them with national regulation . The methodology employed and the result obtained on the level of pollution generated by the national energy sector and corresponding impact on health and it cost are discussed . The work may provide support for decision maker on the priority in the use of available resource , with the aim of environmental preservation . Some approach about how to deal the right balance of local and global responsibility for country a Cuba , are also presented . As the development of those country proceeds , their contribution to GHG emission is expected to become more relevant . Some planned countermeasure for reducing such a trend are illustrated .

aVThe individual-based system of model EFIMOD simulating carbon and nitrogen flow in forest ecosystem ha been used for forecasting the response of forest ecosystem to various forest management regime with climate change . As input data the forest inventory data for the Manturovskii forestry of the Kostroma region were used . It ha been shown that increase of mid-annual temperature and precipitation influence the redistribution of carbon and nitrogen supply in organic form : supply increase of these element in phytomass simultaneously with depletion of them in soil occurred . The most carbon and nitrogen accumulation in forest ecosystem occurs in the scenario without felling . In addition , in this scenario only the ecosystem of the modeling territory function a a carbon sink ; in the other two scenario ( with selective and clear cutting ) they function a a source of carbon . Climate change greatly influence the decomposition rate of organic matter in soil , which lead to increased emission of carbon dioxide . The second consequence of the increase in the destruction rate is nitrogen increase in the soil in a form available for plant that entail productivity increase of stand .

aVArid and semiarid region comprise a large part of the world 's terrestrial area and are home to hundred of million of people . Water resource in arid region are rare and critical to society and to ecosystem . The hydrologic cycle in arid and semiarid region ha been greatly altered due to long-term human exploitation . Under condition of global warming , water resource in these region are expected to be more unstable and ecosystem likely will suffer from severe water stress . In the current special issue contributed to understanding ecohydrologic process and water-related problem in arid region of western China , this paper provides a global perspective on the hydrology and water balance of six major arid basin of the world . A number of global datasets , including the state-of-the-art ensemble simulation of land surface model by GSWP2 ( Global Soil Wetness Project II , a project by GEWEX ) , were used to address the water balance term in the world 's major hydroclimatic region . The common characteristic of hydrologic cycle and water balance in arid basin are a follows : strong evapotranspiration characterizes the hydrological cycle in arid basin ; and in water use sector irrigation consumes a large amount of water , resulting in degradation of native vegetation . From the ecohydrology viewpoint , a comprehensive study of hydrological and ecological process of water utilization in arid basin is urgently needed . Copyright ( C ) 2009 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd .

aVThe level of CO ( 2 ) in the atmosphere have already far exceeded value attained at any other time over at least the past 650,000 year . Temperature increase due to rising greenhouse gas will be amplified in Arctic and subarctic region , and winter warming will be enhanced relative to summer warming . Climate in large area of high latitude may have no analogue in current climate or those of the recent geological past . Experimental field manipulation and laboratory study indicate that plant will exhibit complex response in photosynthesis , growth rate , phenology and reproductive functioning due to this combination of increasing temperature , changing seasonality and increasing level of CO ( 2 ) . The resulting change in the abundance , distribution , growth rate and production of fruit and phenology of plant specie will in turn impact animal population . In predicting what the future biota of the 'New Arctic ' will be like and developing appropriate conservation strategy , Grinnellian niche-based approach are likely to be insufficient , and experimental ecological study of organism response to specific anticipated change in climate are crucial .

aVClimate change have already affected specie distribution shift in many part of the world . The data , on which this research is based on , were collected and studied in Kerman province . The meteorology data were on four month ( December , January , February and March ) from 1991 until 2008 and the phenology data were on six pistachio cultivar that were ranked in three group : early flowering , mid flowering and late flowering collected during the summer in the following year : 1997 , from 2001 until 2005 and 2007 . The evaluated factor included leaf area , normal and abnormal leaf . The result showed the mean temperature in March ha significantly increased during the monitored period and that fluctuation between the year have increased since 1999 , in December , January and February . The abnormality of the leaf in early and late flowering cultivar had the negative correlation with the mean temperature measured in December during the monitored period of time and that the mid flowering cultivar had the positive correlation with the mean temperature measured in February during that same period of time . The change of leaf area on Ahamadaghaei cultivar were le than in other cultivar but Kallehghoochi and Akbari had the highest range which can probably be used a a good marker for determining effect of temperature change in winter on the production level .

aVSpatial variation in sea surface temperature ( SST ) and rainfall change over the tropic are investigated based on ensemble simulation for the first half of the twenty-first century under the greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emission scenario A1B with coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory ( GFDL ) and National Center for Atmospheric Research ( NCAR ) . Despite a GHG increase that is nearly uniform in space , pronounced pattern emerge in both SST and precipitation . Regional difference in SST warming can be a large a the tropical-mean warming . Specifically , the tropical Pacific warming feature a conspicuous maximum along the equator and a minimum in the southeast subtropics . The former is associated with westerly wind anomaly whereas the latter is linked to intensified southeast trade wind , suggestive of wind-evaporation-SST feedback . There is a tendency for a greater warming in the northern subtropics than in the southern subtropics in accordance with asymmetry in trade wind change . Over the equatorial Indian Ocean , surface wind anomaly are easterly , the thermocline shoal , and the warming is reduced in the east , indicative of Bjerknes feedback . In the midlatitudes , ocean circulation change generate narrow banded structure in SST warming . The warming is negatively correlated with wind speed change over the tropic and positively correlated with ocean heat transport change in the northern extratropics . A diagnostic method based on the ocean mixed layer heat budget is developed to investigate mechanism for SST pattern formation . Tropical precipitation change are positively correlated with spatial deviation of SST warming from the tropical mean . In particular , the equatorial maximum in SST warming over the Pacific anchor a band of pronounced rainfall increase . The gross moist instability follows closely relative SST change a equatorial wave adjustment flatten upper-tropospheric warming . The comparison with atmospheric simulation in response to a spatially uniform SST warming illustrates the importance of SST pattern for rainfall change , an effect overlooked in current discussion of precipitation response to global warming . Implications for the global and regional response of tropical cyclone are discussed .

aVA global high-resolution ( similar to 40 km ) atmospheric general circulation model ( ECHAM5 T319 ) is used to investigate the change of tropical cyclone frequency in the North Pacific under global warming . A time slice method is used in which sea surface temperature field derived from a lower-resolution coupled model run under the 20C3M ( in which historical greenhouse gas in 20th century were prescribed a a radiative forcing ) and A1B ( in which carbon dioxide concentration wa increased 1 % each year from 2000 to 2070 and then wa kept constant ) scenario are specified a the lower boundary condition to simulate the current and the future warming climate , respectively . A significant shift is found in the location of tropical cyclone from the western to central Pacific . The shift to more tropical cyclone in the central and le in the western Pacific is not attributable to a change in atmospheric static stability , but to a change in the variance of tropical synoptic-scale perturbation associated with a change in the background vertical wind shear and boundary layer divergence .

aVFor the past 300 year , southeastern Alaska ha undergone rapid ice-melting and land uplift attributable to global warming . Corresponding crustal deformation ( 3 cm/yr ) caused by the Little Ice Age retreat is detectable with modern geodetic technique such a GPS and tidal gauge measurement . Geodetic deformation provides useful information for assessing ice-melting rate , global warming effect , and subcrustal viscosity . Nevertheless , integrated geodetic observation , including gravity measurement , are important . To detect crustal deformation caused by glacial isostatic adjustment and to elucidate the viscosity structure in southeastern Alaska , Japanese and U. S. researcher began a joint 3-year project in 2006 using GPS , Earth tide , and absolute gravity measurement . A new absolute gravity network wa established , comprising five site around Glacier Bay , near Juneau , Alaska . This paper report the network 's gravity measurement during 2006-2008 . The bad ocean model in this area hindered ocean loading correction : Large tidal residual remain in the observation . Accurate tidal correction necessitated on-site tidal observation . Results show high observation precision for all five station : < 1 mu Gal . The gravity rate of change wa found to be -3.5 to -5.6 mu Gal/yr in the gravity network . Furthermore , gravity result obtained during the 3 year indicate a similar gravity change rate . These gravity data are anticipated for application in geophysical study of southeastern Alaska . Using gravity and vertical displacement data , we constructed a quantity to remove viscoelastic effect . The observation are thus useful to constrain present-day ice thickness change . A gravity bias of about -13.2 +/- 0.1 mGal exists between the Potsdam and current FG5 gravity data .

aVAccurate estimation of greenhouse gas emission is essential for developing an appropriate strategy to mitigate global warming . This study examined the characteristic of greenhouse gas emission from power plant , a major greenhouse gas source in Korea . The power plant examined use bituminous coal , anthracite , and sub-bituminous coal a fuel . The CO ( 2 ) concentration from power plant wa measured using GC-FID with methanizer . The amount of carbon , hydrogen , and calorific value in the input fuel wa measured using an elemental analyzer and calorimeter . For fuel analysis , CO ( 2 ) emission factor for anthracite , bituminous coal , and sub-bituminous coal were 108.9 , 88.4 , and 97.9 Mg/kj , respectively . The emission factor developed in this study were compared with those for IPCC . The result showed that CO ( 2 ) emission wa 10.8 % higher for anthracite , 5.5 % lower for bituminous coal , and 1.9 % higher for sub-bituminous coal than the IPCC figure .

aVThe Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum ( PETM ) wa a transient episode of global warming , associated with massive atmospheric greenhouse gas input that occurred at the Paleocene/Eocene boundary . Biostratigraphic and isotope stratigraphic study indicate that the PETM event is well documented in the marl deposit of the Yuhuangding section in the Nanyang Basin , Central China , with a carbon isotope negative excursion of similar to 6.1aEuro degree within 19-m-thick marl deposit . This is the highest resolution record of the PETM so far found in the world . The PETM event wa triggered within 2-cm-thick marl sediment , with a decrease of delta ( 13 ) C ( stable carbon isotope ratio ) from -3.2aEuro degree to -5.2aEuro degree , suggesting a massive methane hydrate release for a transient period that wa possibly caused by a catastrophic event . A comparison between marine and terrestrial record indicates a `` Three-Phase Model '' for the PETM event . Initially there is a rapid negative excursion in the delta ( 13 ) C record , followed by a slowly decreasing trend , and then a gradual positive recovery , corresponding respectively to a rapid dissociation of oceanic methane hydrate , followed by a slow release of methane and then the consumption of the released methane .

aVThe Breede River is not a large river by world standard , but is the largest in South Africa 's Western Province , and play a significant part in the province 's economy . Models predict that flow into it could be seriously affected by climate change . Accordingly a study wa made of trend in flow over recent decade , in the hope that any trend detected would confirm , or otherwise , the prediction of the model . Data on flow over 30 year at various site in the Breede Valley were downloaded from the Department of Water Affairs . The data were first checked for consistency . In 2 case there wa evidence that behaviour of the flow had changed , apparently permanently , during the course of the study period ( typically the variance of the flow had changed markedly at a particular point in time ) . The data series wa accordingly truncated to make use only of the longest series of consistent record . A simple , robust technique wa then employed to detect the trend . The data at each site had a log-normal distribution , and linear regression of the log-transformed data wa used to detect the trend . An F-test showed that in all case the trend were significant ; in one case a t-test indicated the detected trend wa of low significance , but all others were highly significant . The result are discussed in term of land use change being a dominant factor in flow in the Breede River system , to an extent that should not have been ignored in attempting to use the data to predict future flow . Indeed , only one of the site used in the study had a pristine watershed , and that showed a 14 % increase in flow over the study period , contrary to the climate change prediction . There had earlier been a suggestion that climate change might be responsible for the change in flow . It is generally recognised that climate change model can not yet account for local climate change effect . Predictions of possible adverse local impact from global climate change should therefore be treated with the greatest caution . Above all , they must not form the basis for any policy decision until such time a they can reproduce known climatic effect satisfactorily .

aVThe factor governing the rate of change in the amount of atmospheric water vapor are analyzed in simulation of climate change . The global-mean amount of water vapor is estimated to increase at a differential rate of 7.3 % K ( -1 ) with respect to global-mean surface air temperature in the multi-model mean . Larger rate of change result if the fractional change is evaluated over a finite change in temperature ( e.g. , 8.2 % K ( -1 ) for a 3 K warming ) , and rate of change of zonal-mean column water vapor range from 6 to 12 % K ( -1 ) depending on latitude . Clausius-Clapeyron scaling is directly evaluated using an invariant distribution of monthly-mean relative humidity , giving a rate of 7.4 % K ( -1 ) for global-mean water vapor . There are deviation from Clausius-Clapeyron scaling of zonal-mean column water vapor in the tropic and mid-latitudes , but they largely cancel in the global mean . A purely thermodynamic scaling based on a saturated troposphere give a higher global rate of 7.9 % K ( -1 ) . Surface specific humidity increase at a rate of 5.7 % K ( -1 ) , considerably lower than the rate for global-mean water vapor . Surface specific humidity closely follows Clausius-Clapeyron scaling over ocean . But there are widespread decrease in surface relative humidity over land ( by more than 1 % K ( -1 ) in many region ) , and it is argued that decrease of this magnitude could result from the land/ocean contrast in surface warming .

aVHydraulic Hybrid Propulsion for Heavy Vehicles : Combining the Simulation and Engine-In-the-Loop Techniques to Maximize the Fuel Economy and Emission Benefits The global energy situation , the dependence of the transportation sector on fossil fuel , and a need fur a rapid response to the global warming challenge , provide a strong impetus for development of fuel efficient vehicle propulsion . The task is particularly challenging in the case of truck due to severe weight/size constraint . Hybridization is the only approach offering significant breakthrough in near and mid-term . In particular , the series configuration decouples the engine from the wheel and allows full flexibility in controlling the engine operation , while the hydraulic energy conversion and storage provides exceptional power density and efficiency . The challenge stem from a relatively low energy density of the hydraulic accumulator . This place particular emphasis on development of the supervisory controller . The conventional wisdom is to operate the engine at the `` sweet spot '' , but the aggressive pursuit of engine efficiency a the sole objective can lead to frequent and rapid diesel engine transient , thus causing an adverse affect on the soot emission and driver feel . Therefore , we propose a comprehensive methodology for considering a combined hybrid system fuel-economy and emission objective . The fuel economy is addressed with the simulation-based approach , while investigating the impact of engine transient on particulate emission relies on the Engine-In-the-loop ( EIL ) capability . The EIL study confirms advantage of a modulated state-of-charge control over the thermostatic approach , and demonstrates the ability of the Series Hydraulic Hybrid to improve the fuel economy of the medium truck by 72 % , while reducing the particulate emission by 74 % compared to the conventional baseline over the city driving schedule .

aVClimate change affect not only water resource but also water demand for irrigation . A large proportion of the world 's agriculture depends on groundwater , especially in arid and semi-arid region . In several region , aquifer resource face depletion . Groundwater recharge ha been viewed a a by-product of irrigation return flow , and with climate change , aquifer storage of such flow will be vital . A general review , for a broad-based audience , is given of work on global warming and groundwater resource , summarizing the method used to analyze the climate change scenario and the influence of these predicted change on groundwater resource around the world ( especially the impact on regional groundwater resource and irrigation requirement ) . Future challenge of adapting to climate change are also discussed . Such challenge include water-resources depletion , increasing irrigation demand , reduced crop yield , and groundwater salinization . The adaptation to and mitigation of these effect is also reported , including useful information for water-resources manager and the development of sustainable groundwater irrigation method . Rescheduling irrigation according to the season , coordinating the groundwater resource and irrigation demand , developing more accurate and complete modeling prediction method , and managing the irrigation facility in different way would all be considered , based on the particular case .

aVGlobal warming is affecting agribusiness in it economic aspect . Therefore , the prediction of the evolution of Brazilian beef cattle production cost wa made using the IPCC forecast scenario for global warming . The methodology consisted of two step : ( i ) the development of a fuzzy model that estimated the grazing land capacity ( RP ) decrease risk a a function of the change in the average total rain index , air temperature and increase in extension of the dry season ; and ( ii ) the design of an algorithm for predicting the decrease in production a function of the RP fuzzy model , that result in the impact in beef cattle productivity , and consequent increase in production cost . Historical environmental data from important producing county in the Cerrado were organized and a set of fuzzy Gaussian function were developed , and three possible setting ( optimistic , medium and pessimistic ) were considered . The decrease in beef cattle productivity wa estimated using the loss in production due to the increase in air temperature and vulnerability of pasture capacity . The boundary setting for the total increase of production cost scenario used the number of animal per area of grazing land , the adoption of grain supplement and it future scenario ; and the result output function pointed to a threshold within a variation from an increase in production cost of 80 % ( optimistic ) to 160 % ( pessimistic ) . Under the optimistic scenario the total cost of Brazilian beef cattle production in the Cerrado became near to US $ 2.88 kg ( -1 ) , while in the pessimistic scenario this cost reached US $ 4.16 kg ( -1 ) , challenging the international competitiveness of this economic segment .

aVThe trend to increased temperature would lead to great change in the development cycle of plant and style of agriculture in a particular locality . The effect of the temperature projected by the IPCC on the phenology of Vitis vinifera ( L. ) Gewurtztraminer variety , in two area of cold climate viticulture in southern Chile , wa analyzed in this paper . A mathematical model wa adjusted on phenology data and degree-days collected for two year . The model obtained wa run with temperature data from current weather and those projected with the A2 and B2 scenario for the period 2070-2100 . The analysis of the result show that local climate would present significant increase in the temperature sum ( degree-days ) , reducing up to 17 d the bud-burst to flowering period and between 28-46 d the period of sprouting to harvest , in the most extreme scenario . Phenology is very sensitive to global warming scenario and probable climate change . Characterizing it possible behavior could serve a reference to define strategy for the future planning of a vineyard .

aVGlobal warming tends to be the major characteristic of the dramatic global climate change . To deal with these change , the impact of reducing greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emission on Chinese future economic and social development ha to be assessed . In this paper , a Regional Integrated model of Climate and the Economy ( RICE ) , which is well known and accepted widely , ha been used for Chinese economic assessment of climate change after introduction , assimilation and verification . Based on a sensitivity analysis of technical parameter in the RICE model and constrained target proposed for energy saving and emission reduction technological advance program of China from 2000 to 2050 , the economic impact of the program is examined . The result indicate that when technology advance , Chinese CO ( 2 ) emission , climate loss , and the growth rate of atmospheric CO ( 2 ) concentration and temperature will all decrease . It is assumed that in 2010 , the CO ( 2 ) emission is 20 % lower than in 2005 , CO ( 2 ) emission in 2050 would only double the level in 2000 , the accumulative CO ( 2 ) emission would be decreased by 12.4 GtC , and the atmospheric CO ( 2 ) concentration and temperature in 2050 would reduce by 35 GtC and 0.04A degree C respectively from 2000 to 2050 . The accumulative climate loss from 2000 to 2050 will drop down by 4.6 billion dollar , which only account for 6 % of the global total benefit . However , the economic benefit the developed country will obtain is 10 time that for China under such a technological advance scenario . The decrease of the CO ( 2 ) emission control rate is 1 % in cooperation policy while 4.6 % in non-cooperation policy , which would relieve China 's burden in the control of CO ( 2 ) total emission and thereby benefit China in participation of the international cooperation for CO ( 2 ) emission reduction .

aVAlpine glacier usually feature with best hydrothermal condition in mountain climate , and present beautiful glacier scenery , various glacier landforms , rich biodiversity , and easier accessibility , compared with continental glacier or ice sheet . Nevertheless , Alpine glacier are more sensitive to climate warming , and climate warming ha seriously affected Alpine glacier and surrounding environment . The quality and attractiveness of Alpine glacier to tourism ha been and will continue to be diminished with tourist ' visitation and local economic development . At present , it ha become a primary problem that Alpine glacier tourism adapts to climate warming . Based on this reason , the purpose of this article is to take Baishui ( sic ) Glacier No . 1 a an example to outline the possible impact of climate warming on Alpine glacier tourism and put forward some adaptive measure and strategy aligned with climate warming . Specific measure are a follows : ( 1 ) optimize the space layout of glacier tourism area ; ( 2 ) improve glacier tourism and environmental protection planning ; ( 3 ) adopt multidimensional protective measure ; ( 4 ) strengthen scientific research of glacier and environment protection ; ( 5 ) develop glacier tourism product by multi-directions ; ( 6 ) integrate regional tourism resource ; ( 7 ) reinforce public environmental education .

aVMethane emission from aquatic environment depend on methane formation ( MF ) and methane oxidation ( MO ) rate . One important question is to what extent increased temperature will affect the balance between MF and MO . We measured potential MF and MO rate simultaneously at 4 , 10 , 20 and 30A degree C in sediment from eight different lake representing typical boreal and northern temperate lake type . Potential MF rate ranged between 0.002 and 3.99 mu mol CH ( 4 ) g ( d.w. ) ( -1 ) day ( -1 ) , potential MO rate ranged from 0.01 to 0.39 CH ( 4 ) g ( d.w. ) ( -1 ) day ( -1 ) . The potential MF rate were sensitive to temperature and increased 10 to 100 fold over the temperature interval studied . MF also differed between lake and wa correlated to sediment water content , percent of organic material and C : N ratio . Potential MO did not depend on temperature or sediment characteristic but wa instead well explained by MF rate at the in situ temperature . It implies that elevated temperature will enhance MF rate which may cause increased methane release from sediment until MO increase a well , a a response to higher methane level .

aVClimate change impact in life cycle assessment ( LCA ) are usually assessed a the emission of greenhouse gas expressed with the global warming potential ( GWP ) . However , change in surface albedo caused by land use change can also contribute to change the Earth 's energy budget . In this paper we present a methodology for including in LCA the climatic impact of land surface albedo change , measured a CO ( 2 ) -eq . emission or emission offset . A review of study calculating radiative forcings and CO ( 2 ) -equivalence of change in surface albedo is carried out . A methodology is proposed , and some methodological issue arising from it application are discussed . The methodology is applied in a practical example dealing with greenhouse agriculture in Southern Spain . The result of the case study show that the increase in surface albedo due to the reflective plastic cover of greenhouse involves an important CO ( 2 ) -eq . emission offset , which reduces the net GWP-100 of tomato production from 303 to 168 kg CO ( 2 ) -eq . per ton tomato when a 50-year service time is considered for the agricultural activity . This example show that albedo effect can be very important in a product system when land use play an important role , and substantial change in surface albedo are involved . Although the method presented in this work can be improved concerning the calculation of radiative forcing , it constitutes a first operative approach which can be used to develop regionalized characterization factor and provide a more complete evaluation of impact on the climate change impact category .

aVCurrently , because of water scarcity created by global climate change , integrating of water value provided from forest ecosystem into forest management planning ha become great important . This research integrated water value into forest management planning and explained their effect on forest dynamic . Model output a Net Present Value ( NPV ) and amount of timber and water were used a performance indicator . The result showed that water production aimed strategy ( *W ) provided minimum timber production while timber production aimed strategy ( *T ) obtained minimum water production . Results also showed that reforestation of Forest Openings ( FO ) provide high timber and low water production .

aVThe climate response to the Maunder Minimum-type total solar irradiance ( TSI ) decrease in the pre-industrial ( PI ) era and IPCC B1 global warming scenario are examined using the NCAR CAM3 coupled with a mixed-layer slab ocean model . The TSI reduction shift the AO/NAO state to a more negative index , resulting in regional surface air temperature ( SAT ) change in the model . In addition , the positive sea ice-solar radiation feedback amplifies the surface cooling due to the TSI decrease . The global annual average cooling effect induced by the TSI decrease is reduced to 0.254 degree C in the B1 scenario from 0.347 degree C in the PI epoch , this difference being due to both the suppressed sea ice-solar radiation feedback and the stronger greenhouse effect associated with the increase of greenhouse gas . However , regional SAT change in the B1 scenario are strengthened markedly due to the enhanced negative AO/NAO . The warming in the western Greenland , Central Asia and East Asia will be enhanced in the B1 global warming scenario when the TSI decrease . These difference in response between the B1 and PI scenario illustrate that the impact of multi-decadal solar variation on climate depends on the atmospheric background trace gas composition . A future solar grand minimum doe not offset the CO ( 2 ) -induced warming in the B1 scenario , but through the enhanced negative AO/NAO may indeed amplify the warming in certain region .

aVRising energy price , global warming , and more stringent environmental regulation have resulted in an interest in warm mix asphalt ( WMA ) technology a a mean to decrease the energy consumption and emission associated with conventional hot mix asphalt production . However , the utilization of the hydrated lime and liquid antistripping agent ( ASA ) in WMA mixture make these issue more complicated . The objective of this study wa to investigate and evaluate the moisture susceptibility of the mixture containing ASA and WMA additive . The experimental design for this study included the utilization of one binder source ( PG 64-22 ) , three ASA additive and control , two WMA additive and virgin , and three aggregate source . A total of 36 type of mixture and 216 specimen were fabricated and tested in this study . The performed property include indirect tensile strength ( ITS ) , tensile strength ratio ( TSR ) , flow , and toughness . The result indicated that the hydrate lime exhibit the best moisture resistance for WMA mixture , the liquid ASA additive can increase the ITS value of the mixture but the liquid ASA generally exhibit a weak moisture resistance compared to the hydrate lime regardless of WMA and aggregate type in this study . In addition , the wet ITS value of mixture containing WMA additive were lower than that of the mixture without WMA additive .

aVThe environmental effect of global climate change ( GCC ) are becoming more evident . Nonetheless , effort to document it effect on the durability of infrastructure are still limited . The present study used long term data ( 1961-2008 ) on temperature , relative humidity , precipitation and evaporation recorded in a tropical microclimate of the port of Progreso ( Yucatan , Mexico ) in order to detect climatic pattern associated to GCC . In addition , the author analysed chloride profile in concrete of different quality but of the same age ( 15 year ) and exposed to the same microclimate . Results suggest the presence of environmental change associated to GCC during the last 40 year , especially in term of average and maximum temperature , which showed increase of 1 and 0.22 degree C per decade respectively . Results also showed that seasonal and multiannual climatic cycle had an influence on the behaviour of the chloride profile of the studied concrete and thus on their durability .

aVLake ice thickness change with regional hydrometeorology and is closely associated with global climate change . We tested the detection of ice thickness using ground penetrating radar ( GPR ) in the Hongqipao reservoir . Ice crystal , gas bubble , ice density and ice thickness were also determined by concurrently drilling for validation . During the test the gas bubble content wa high in the upper and low in the bottom , ice density varied with the bubble content , and the ice thickness wa not homogeneous . By comparison between radar detected and in-situ measured ice thickness with theoretical analysis of the influence of gas bubble content on the dielectric constant , a three-layer model with snow , granular ice , and columnar ice wa established and the transmission speed of radar wave within the ice wa determined . Experience reveals that the equivalent dielectric constant can be used to evaluate the wave speed and the value at 1/3 ice cover depth can be used a equivalent value . Besides , the difference between the theoretical transmission time and the real detection time induced by large gas bubble increase nonlinearly with the theoretical transmission time or ice thickness .

aVAlpine ecosystem are harsh environment where low temperature are generally a limiting factor . Predicted global warming is thus expected to have a profound impact on alpine ecosystem in the future . This study wa conducted to compare the effect of experimental warming on soil in two contrasting forest ecosystem ( a dragon spruce plantation and a natural forest ) using the open top chamber ( OTC ) method in the Eastern Tibetan Plateau of China . The OTC enhanced average daily mean soil temperature by 0.61A degree C ( plantation ) and 0.55A degree C ( natural forest ) , respectively , throughout the growing season . Conversely , soil volumetric moisture declined by 4.10 % in the plantation and by 2.55 % in the natural forest . Across all measuring date , warming increased average soil CO ( 2 ) efflux by 10.6 % in the plantation and by 15.4 % in the natural forest . However , elevated temperature did not affect the respiration quotient in either forest . Two-stage sulfuric acid hydrolysis wa used to quantify labile and recalcitrant C and N fraction in the two contrasting soil . Warming significantly reduced labile C and N fraction in both ecosystem but did not influence the total , recalcitrant and microbial biomass C and N pool . Labile C , N and microbial biomass C showed significant interaction in warming x forest type x season . Irrespective of warming treatment , all measured pool were significantly larger in the natural forest compared to the plantation . Taken together , our result indicate that the lowered soil labile C and N pool may be induced by the increased soil CO ( 2 ) efflux . The response of the natural forest soil were more sensitive to experimental warming than those of the plantation . We conclude that reforestation dramatically lower soil C and N pool , further affecting the response of forest soil to future global warming .

aVInsects are highly successful animal inhabiting marine , freshwater and terrestrial habitat from the equator to the pole . As a group , insect have limited ability to regulate their body temperature and have thus required a range of strategy to support life in thermally stressful environment , including behavioural avoidance through migration and seasonal change in cold tolerance . With respect to overwintering strategy , insect have traditionally been divided into two main group : freeze tolerant and freeze avoiding , although this simple classification is underpinned by a complex of interacting process , i.e . synthesis of ice nucleating agent , cryoprotectants , antifreeze protein and change in membrane lipid composition . Also , in temperate and colder climate , the overwintering ability of many specie is closely linked to the diapause state , which often increase cold tolerance ahead of temperature-induced seasonal acclimatisation . Importantly , even though most specie can invoke one or both of these response , the majority of insect die from the effect of cold rather than freezing . Most study on the effect of a changing climate on insect have focused on process that occur predominantly in summer ( development , reproduction ) and on change in distribution rather than winter survival per se . For specie that routinely experience cold stress , a general hypothesis would be that predicted temperature increase of 1 degree C to 5 degree C over the next 50-100 year would increase winter survival in some climatic zone . However , this is unlikely to be a universal effect . Negative impact may occur if climate warming lead to a reduction or loss of winter snow cover in polar and sub-polar area , resulting in exposure to more severe air temperature , increasing frequency of freeze-thaw cycle and risk of ice encasement . Likewise , whilst the dominant diapause-inducing cue ( photoperiod ) will be unaffected by global climate change , higher temperature may modify normal rate of development , leading to a de-coupling of synchrony between diapause-sensitive life-cycle stage and critical photoperiods for diapause induction . In term of climate warming and potential heat stress , the most recent prediction of summer temperature in Europe of 40 degree C or higher in 50-75 year , are close to the current upper lethal limit of some insect . Long-term data set on insect distribution and the timing of annual migration provide strong evidence for 'positive ' response to higher winter temperature over timescales of the past 20-50 year in North America , Europe and Asia .

aVGovernments are currently considering policy that will limit greenhouse gas concentration , including negotiation of an international treaty to replace the expiring Kyoto Protocol . Existing mitigation target have arisen primarily from political negotiation , and the ability of such policy to avoid dangerous impact is still uncertain . Using a large suite of climate model experiment , we find that substantial intensification of hot extreme could occur within the next 3 decade , below the 2 degree C global warming target currently being considered by policy maker . We also find that the intensification of hot extreme is associated with a shift towards more anticyclonic atmospheric circulation during the warm season , along with warm-season drying over much of the U. S. The possibility that intensification of hot extreme could result from relatively small increase in greenhouse gas concentration suggests that constraining global warming to 2 degree C may not be sufficient to avoid dangerous climate change .

aVFlooding boreal forest ecosystem for hydroelectric power generation may release substantial amount of carbon ( C ) to the atmosphere , contributing to global warming . The objective of this study were to evaluate CO ( 2 ) and CH ( 4 ) production rate using spring/fall ( 14 degree C ) and summer ( 21 degree C ) temperature under non-flooded and flooded condition . Incubation temperature represented the mean annual air temperature in May and September ( 14 degree C ) , and in July ( 21 degree C ) . Greenhouse gas production rate were quantified using laboratory incubation of 2 contrasting soil type ( Humo-Ferric Podzol [ very dry , mineral ] and a Histic Folisol [ moist , organic ] ) collected at the Experimental Lakes Area in northwestern Ontario , Canada . The mean production rate of CO ( 2 ) and CH ( 4 ) in the headspace of the incubation jar wa significantly influenced by temperature , flooding and soil type . Results showed that the mean CO ( 2 ) ( 65 [ Podzol ] ; 43 [ Folisol ] ) and CH ( 4 ) ( 0.06 [ Podzol ] ; 0.06 [ Folisol ] ) production rate ( mu g.g ( -1 ) .d ( -1 ) ) were significantly higher ( P < 0.05 ) at 21 degree C and in flooded treatment from both soil type . The greatest CO ( 2 ) and CH ( 4 ) production rate ( mu g.g ( -1 ) .d ( -1 ) ) occurred from the Folisol ( 110 [ CO ( 2 ) ] ; 0.03 [ CH ( 4 ) ] ) and the L and FH horizon of the Podzol ( 250 [ CO ( 2 ) ] ; 0.05 [ CH4 ] ) . Q ( 10 ) value showed that decomposition of soil organic matter wa more temperature dependent in non-flooded treatment , with value ranging from 1.57 to 5.03 , than in flooded treatment ( 1.31 to 3.58 ) . The greatest loss of soil organic carbon relative to the original C content ( g.m ( -2 ) ) occurred in the Ah horizon of the Podzol in non-flooded ( 0.01 % [ 14 degree C ] ; 0.02 % [ 21 degree C ] ) and flooded ( 0.02 % [ 14 degree C ] ; 0.03 % [ 21 degree C ] ) treatment and at both temperature . Information presented in this paper help to evaluate how 2 contrasting soil type ( Podzol and Folisol ) responded to flooding and provided further insight into the dynamic of greenhouse gas ( GHG ) production rate a a result of hydroelectric reservoir creation . This will aid in future planning , construction , and management of hydroelectric reservoir to help minimize GHG emission and boreal forest disturbance .

aVOzone ( O ( 3 ) ) , a potent air pollutant and a significant greenhouse gas , ha been recognized a a major component of global climate change . However , current increasing trend in it background level are projecting a more severe threat to natural and cultivated plant in the near future . The present study ha been designed to evaluate the impact of elevated concentration of O ( 3 ) on phenotypical , physiological , and biochemical trait in two high-yielding cultivar of wheat , followed by analysis of the leaf proteome using one/two-dimensional gel electrophoresis ( 1-/2-DGE ) coupled to immunoblotting and mass spectrometry analysis under near-natural condition using open top chamber . Prominently , O ( 3 ) exposure caused specific foliar injury in both the wheat cultivar . Results also showed that O ( 3 ) stress significantly decreased photosynthetic rate , stomatal conductance , and chlorophyll fluorescence kinetics ( F ( v ) /F ( m ) ) in test cultivar . Biochemical evaluation further revealed a higher loss in photosynthetic pigment , whereas a significantly induced antioxidant system under elevated O ( 3 ) concentration pointed toward an ability of O ( 3 ) to generate oxidative stress . 1-DGE analysis showed drastic reduction in the abundantly present ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase ( RuBisCO ) large and small subunit . Western blot analysis confirmed induced accumulation of antioxidative enzyme like superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase protein ( s ) and common defense/stress-related thaumatin-like protein ( s ) . 2-DGE analysis revealed a total of 38 differentially expressed protein spot , common in both the wheat cultivar . Among those , some major leaf photosynthetic protein ( including RuBisCO and RuBisCO activase ) and important energy metabolism protein ( including ATP synthase , aldolase , and phosphoglycerate kinase ) were drastically reduced , whereas some stress/defense-related protein ( such a harpin-binding protein and germin-like protein ) were induced . In all , the present study reveals an intimate molecular network provoked by O ( 3 ) affecting photosynthesis and triggering antioxidative defense and stress-related protein culminating in accelerated foliar injury in wheat plant .

aVIn accordance with numerous investigation , global climate warming due to the increased greenhouse gas content in the atmosphere can significantly influence the environment already in the near decade . In order to mitigate or prevent possible adverse consequence of this warming the technology on reducing greenhouse gas emission a well a a deliberate interference with climate , including it control , are under consideration . Let u analyze the present investigation on the estimate of the influence of a simultaneous increase in the atmospheric CO ( 2 ) concentration and in the stratospheric aerosol on the global and regional climate , ozone layer , and World Ocean acidification . It is noted that the production and subsequent maintenance of the artificial aerosol layer in the stratosphere could , in principle , eliminate or retard climate warming , but it would be accompanied by a decrease in the global precipitation , especially in the tropical zone . Furthermore , the stratospheric aerosol screen doe not solve the problem of the atmospheric CO ( 2 ) increase , which in turn result in the further World Ocean acidification , and thus ha an adverse effect on the marine part of the biosphere . Political and ethic issue connected with the deliberate global man interference with the natural environment are also under consideration .

aVLand-use type affect gross nitrogen transformation and this information is particularly lacking under varied low temperature condition . In this study , the effect of land-use type ( forest vs. grassland ) and temperature ( 10 vs. 15 degree C ) on gross N transformation rate under aerobic condition were investigated using the ( 15 ) N isotope pool dilution technique in the laboratory . Soils were collected from forest and grassland site in China and Canada . The result showed that gross N mineralization and immobilization rate were significantly higher in forest soil than in grassland soil , while the reverse wa true for gross nitrification rate . The higher TC and lower SOCw concentration in the Chinese soil relative to the Canadian soil were related to the greater gross N mineralization rate and lower gross N immobilization rate in Chinese soil . The greater gross N mineralization rate and lower gross N immobilization rate resulted in much higher inorganic N accumulation and that may increase the risk of NO ( 3 ) ( - ) leaching in the Chinese soil . Increasing temperature significantly increased gross nitrification rate in grassland soil and gross N immobilization rate in forest soil , suggesting that grassland soil maybe more vulnerable to N loss through NO ( 3 ) ( - ) leaching or denitrification ( when condition for denitrification exist ) and that conversion of grassland to forest soil may exert le negative effect on the environment by promoting the retention of N and decreasing the production of NO ( 3 ) ( - ) and subsequently the risk of NO ( 3 ) ( - ) leaching under increasing temperature by global warming .

aVLate Ordovician shelly fauna occur at several locality in the Ostersund area of Jamtland ( Sweden ) and developed against a background of intense and rapid global climate change . In the eastern part , approximately in the middle part of the Krykas Quartzite , and in the western part in the uppermost Kogsta Siltstone change in fauna and sedimentary pattern provide regional evidence of these global event . In both area the fauna occur in shale and siltstone facies and are used to effect correlation between the eastern and western part of the region , which show major difference in facies development . These sub-basins , situated on the margin of a developing mountain belt , reacted differently to global signal providing further evidence of the heterogeneous response to climate change at the end of the Ordovician Period .

aVPalaeosols of the Koluel-Kaike Formation , a red colour-banded , pyroclastic succession from southern Argentina , constitute a proxy for Eocene climate change . Reticulated and vertically elongated ferric mottle , along with iron and manganese nodule are the most significant climate indicator , which originated by alternating cycle of waterlogging and drying condition causing Fe-Mn mobilization and fixation . Clay mineral vary from a kaolinite > smectite suite in the lower and middle section , to a smectite > kaolinite one in the upper part . High concentration of iron oxides/hydroxides and kaolinite , lack of exchangeable base , absence of carbonate cement , presence of ironstone and redness of hue in most of the palaeosols suggest intense chemical weathering related to leaching and lateritization process . Five pedotypes , ordered in a stratigraphic sense , were identified . Strongly developed , red to orange Chornk ( Fragiaquult ) and Kapenk ( Plinthaquult ) pedotypes display argillic horizon , abundant ferric nodule and slickensides ; they are dominant in the lower and middle section , and formed in seasonal humid and megathermic ( tropical ) condition with a mean annual precipitation of 1200 to 1300 mm and a mean annual temperature of 15 degree C. Weakly developed , le structured Ornek ( Vitrand ) and Polnek ( Placaquand ) pedotypes occur in the middle and upper section , and originated in sub-humid and mesic-megathermic condition with a mean annual precipitation around 1000 mm and a mean annual temperature around 12 degree C. The brownish Soorsh ( Argialboll ) pedotype exhibit a granular structure and is present at the uppermost part of the unit . It developed in sub-humid/semi-arid and mesic condition , with a mean annual precipitation of 600 to 700 mm and a mean annual temperature around 10 degree C. This pedotype succession and clay mineral distribution indicates a decrease in chemical weathering and degree of soil development with time . Koluel-Kaike palaeosols from Central Patagonia are some of the first continental non-palaeobiological data linked to the Early Palaeogene global warming in South America ; they show an especially close relationship with the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum and the following long-term cooling and drying initiated by Middle to Late Eocene time .

aVMicula murus is one of the main calcareous nannofossil biostratigrapic marker of Tethyan and Intermediate province in the upper Maastrichtian ( uppermost Cretaceous ) . A review of it first occurrence at 14 deep-sea site and section show that it is time transgressive from the Tropical Realm of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans to the intermediate latitude of the North Atlantic , South Atlantic , Indian Ocean , and the northern Tethys . M. murus remained confined to the Tropical Realm for similar to 1.2 m.y . in the early-late Maastrichtian , thus supporting high-latitudinal thermal gradient . It subsequently spread out in the late Maastrichtian to temperate latitude and to the Tethys in coincidence with the onset of a thermohaline circulation change ca . 67.5 Ma , suggesting a major change in surface-water circulation and interocean communication .

aVGlobal climate change is expected to result in more frequent and intense drought in the Mediterranean region . To understand forest response to severe drought , we used a mobile rainfall shelter to examine the impact of spring and autumn rainfall exclusion on stomatal ( S ( L ) ) and non-stomatal ( NS ( L ) ) limitation of photosynthesis in a Quercus ilex ecosystem . Spring rainfall exclusion , carried out during increasing atmospheric demand and leaf development , had a larger impact on photosynthesis than autumn exclusion , conducted at a time of mature foliage and decreasing vapour pressure deficit . The relative importance of NS ( L ) increased with drought intensity . S ( L ) and NS ( L ) were equal once total limitation ( T ( L ) ) reached 60 % , but NS ( L ) greatly exceeded S ( L ) during severe drought , with 76 % NS ( L ) partitioned equally between mesophyll conductance ( MC ( L ) ) and biochemical ( B ( L ) ) limitation when T ( L ) reached 100 % . Rainfall exclusion altered the relationship between leaf water potential and photosynthesis . In response to severe mid-summer drought stress , A ( n ) and V ( cmax ) were 75 % and 72 % lower in the spring exclusion plot than in the control plot at the same pre-dawn leaf water potential . Our result revealed change in the relationship between photosynthetic parameter and water stress that are not currently included in drought parameterizations for modelling application .

aVThe objective of this study wa to integrate process life cycle assessment ( LCA ) into an activity-based microeconoinic model of production to quantify environmental impact induced by economic incentive imposed on individual producer . The economic incentive may include price change , technological innovation and governmental taxes/subsidies that are beyond the scope of Input-Output-based LCA . In this approach , however , traditional normative activity analysis hardly reproduces the observed input variable referred to a `` reference point '' , a is often the case with linear programming model widely used for farm management . Consequently , the resultant LCA deviate from the original LCA that is evaluated at the reference point . This study made an attempt to bridge the gap between the theoretically derived LCA and the original process LCA by introducing the positive mathematical programming ( PMP ) approach , which wa established by Howitt . The PMP-based LCA wa applied to conventional and reduced tillage farming system in Hokkaido , northern Japan , to consider it potential for analyzing an area-based farm policy and to discus several limitation to be addressed in future research .

aVIn this study , a life cycle assessment ( LCA ) method wa used to examine the environmental impact of the rice production system in Taihu region , China . The LCA considered the entire system required to produce 1 t of rice . The analysis included raw material extraction and transportation , agrochemical production and transportation , and arable farming in the field . The result show that the significance of environmental impact , followed by aquatic eutrophication , water depletion , global warming , acidification , and energy depletion . As such , reducing nitrogen ( N ) fertilizer intensity and increasing utilization efficiency are the key point to control the life cycle environmental impact of rice , which would decrease resource consumption and emission not only directly in the arable farming subsystem but also indirectly in the upstream production stage . Strengthening water management , especially in the early growth stage , and reduction of paddy field water discharge are also significant measure with which to minimize N and phosphorus ( P ) runoff loss and control acidification potential ( AP ) and aquatic eutrophication potential ( AEP ) , so a to reduce life cycle environmental impact of the rice production system .

aVPast life cycle assessment ( LCA ) of sugarcane ( Saccharum officinarum ) production have commonly been based on limited datasets , and variability ha not been well described . In this work , Australian sugarcane production wa assessed more comprehensively in order to generate a robust set of LCA result for use in subsequent assessment of sugarcane product and also to investigate : ( 1 ) variability due to regional difference , ( 2 ) factor influencing variability , and ( 3 ) significance of the impact . An average scenario for Australian sugarcane production wa modeled based on data for the state of Queensland ( 98 % of Australian production ) . Life cycle impact assessment ( LCIA ) result were generated using Impact 2002+ , modified to be more representative of Australian condition , and with the inclusion of water use and land use indicator . A Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis , using minimum and maximum value for production data , wa undertaken to evaluate variability . Different regional production practice were also modeled to identify factor that influence variability . Normalization aimed to show the significance of total Australian sugarcane production relative to total Australian impact . Considerable variability wa found in the LCIA result , with the key variable being yield , N use efficiency , the susceptibility of soil to N leakage , irrigation ( water and energy intensity ) , and pre-harvest burning . N leakage wa found to be an important issue that influence a range of impact category . When normalized against total national impact , water use and land use appear to be the most significant impact ( based on simple indicator of consumption ) , followed by eutrophication potential , acidification potential , and respiratory impact , whereas non-renewable energy input and global warming are le significant . The result suggest that toxicity impact are insignificant ; however , this may not be supported by other observation that link pesticide loss from sugarcane to toxicity concern in receiving water and is a subject for further research . The potential for significant variability in the impact from sugarcane growing suggests a need for LCAs of sugarcane system to consider range for key variable . The key variable and significant impact identified in this work can guide data collection priority for future assessment of sugarcane and possibly other Australian cropping system . To further develop LCA a a useful predictive tool for Australian agricultural system , further development and testing of impact assessment model for eutrophication , toxicity , and land and water resource depletion appropriate for Australia and it subregions will be required .

aVAnalysis of lower carbon power system ha tended to focus on the operational carbon dioxide ( CO ( 2 ) ) emission from power station . However , to achieve the large cut required it is necessary to understand the whole-life contribution of all sector of the electricity industry . Here , a preliminary assessment of the life cycle carbon emission of the transmission network in Great Britain is presented . Using a 40-year period and assuming a static generation mix it show that the carbon equivalent emission ( or global warming potential ) of the transmission network are around 11 gCO ( 2-eq ) /kWh of electricity transmitted and that almost 19 time more energy is transmitted by the network than is used in it construction and operation . Operational emission account for 96 % of this with transmission loss alone totalling 85 % and sulphur hexafluoride ( SF ( 6 ) ) emission featuring significantly . However , the CO ( 2 ) embodied within the raw material of the network infrastructure itself represents a modest 3 % . Transmission investment decision informed by whole-life cycle carbon assessment of network design could balance higher financial and carbon 'capital ' cost of larger conductor with lower transmission loss and CO ( 2 ) emission over the network lifetime . This will , however , necessitate new regulatory approach to properly incentivise transmission company . ( C ) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVThis study aimed to identify the environmental and economic aspect of the wind-hydrogen system using life cycle assessment ( LCA ) and life cycle costing ( LCC ) methodology . The target H ( 2 ) pathway are the H ( 2 ) pathway of water electrolysis ( WE ) with wind power ( WE [ Wind ] ) and the H ( 2 ) pathway of WE by Korean electricity mix ( WE [ KEM ] ) . Conventional fuel ( gasoline and diesel ) are also included a target fuel pathway to identify the fuel pathway with economic and environmental advantage over conventional fuel . The key environmental issue in the transportation sector are analyzed in term of fossil fuel consumption ( FFC ) , regulated air pollutant ( RAPs ) , abiotic resource depletion ( ARD ) , and global warming ( GW ) . The life cycle cost of the target fuel pathway consist of the well-to-tank ( WTT ) cost and the tank-to-wheel ( TTW ) cost . Moreover , two scenario are analyzed to predict potential economic and environmental improvement offered by wind energy-powered hydrogen station . In LCA result , WE [ Wind ] is superior to the other pathway in all environmental category . The LCC result show that the projected WTT cost saving of WE [ Wind ] and WE [ KEM ] compared to gasoline are US $ 0.050 and US $ 0.036 per MJ , respectively , because hydrogen will not be subjected to any fuel tax according to the Korean Energy Policy in 2015 . Although WE [ KEM ] and WE [ Wind ] incur high capital cost owing to the required capital investment in fuel cell vehicle ( FCVs ) , they have lower well-to-wheel ( WTW ) cost than those of conventional fuel due to the high FCV efficiency in fuel utilization stage . WTW cost for gasoline are higher than those of WE [ KEM ] and WE [ Wind ] by US $ 12,600 and US $ 10,200 , respectively . This study demonstrated the future competitiveness of the WE [ Wind ] pathway in both environmental and economic aspect . In the WTT stage , the point-of-sale of the electricity produced by the wind power plant ( WPP ) can not be controlled because the wind-powered electricity production fluctuates considerably depending on the wind . However , the use of a wind-powered H ( 2 ) station in the future enables stable wind power plant management and provides greater economic profit than the present system since the wind-powered electricity can be used for the hydrogen production in the H ( 2 ) station and any residual electricity is sold to Korea electric power corporation ( KEPCO ) . If 5 % of conventional vehicle in Korea are substituted with FCVs using H ( 2 ) via WE [ Wind ] in 2015 , CO ( 2 ) emission will be reduced by 2,876,000 tons/year and annual LCC cost by US $ 8559 million . Thus , the operation of wind-powered hydrogen station will encourage the introduction of hydrogen into the transportation fuel market . ( C ) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Professor T.

aVThis paper describes the development and application of the Stochastic Integrated Waste Management Simulator ( SIWMS ) model . SIWMS provides a detailed view of the environmental impact and associated cost of municipal solid waste ( MSW ) management alternative under condition of uncertainty . The model follows a life-cycle inventory approach extended with compensatory system to provide more equitable base for comparing different alternative . Economic performance is measured by the net present value . The model is verified against four publicly available model under deterministic condition and then used to study the impact of uncertainty on Sydney 's MSW management 'best practice ' . Uncertainty ha a significant effect on all impact category . The greatest effect is observed in the global warming category where a reversal of impact direction is predicted . The reliability of the system is most sensitive to uncertainty in the waste processing and disposal . The result highlight the importance of incorporating uncertainty at all stage to better understand the behaviour of the MSW system . ( C ) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVThe storage of carbon dioxide ( CO ( 2 ) ) in saline aquifer is one of the most promising option for Europe to reduce emission of green-house gas from power plant to the atmosphere and to mitigate global climate change . The CO ( 2 ) SINK ( CO ( 2 ) Storage by Injection into a saline aquifer at Ketzin ) project is a research and development ( R & D ) project , mainly supported by the European Commission , the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research , and the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology , targeted at developing an in-situ laboratory for CO ( 2 ) storage . The preparatory phase of the project involved a baseline geological-site exploration and the drilling of one injection and two observation well , a well a the acquisition of a geophysical baseline and geochemical monitoring , in Ketzin , located near Berlin . The target saline aquifer is the lithologically heterogeneous Triassic Stuttgart formation , situated at approximately 630- to 710-m ( 2,070- to 2,330-ft ) depth . A comprehensive borehole-logging program wa performed consisting of routine well logging complemented with an enhanced logging program for one well that recorded nuclear-magnetic-resonance ( NMR ) and borehole-resistivity image , to characterize the storage formation better . A core analysis program carried out on reservoir rock and caprock included measurement of helium porosity , nitrogen permeability , and brine permeability at different pressure condition . The saline aquifer at Ketzin show a variable porosity/permeability distribution , which is related to grain size , facies variation , and rock cementation with value in the range from 5 to > 35 % and 0.02 to > 5,000 md for porosity and permeability , respectively . On the basis of core analysis and logging data , an elemental log-analysis model for the target formation wa established for all three well . In addition , permeability wa estimated using the Coates equation and compared with core data and NMR log-derived permeability , which seems to provide meaningful permeability estimate for the Ketzin reservoir . On the basis of the good core control that guided the petrophysical well-log interpretation in the first two CO ( 2 ) SINK well , a porosity and permeability prediction by analogy for the third well is appropriate and applicable . The availability of core wa crucial for a sophisticated formation evaluation at borehole scale that characterizes the real subsurface condition .

aVShort-term effect of environmental perturbation on various life history trait are reasonably well documented in bird and mammal . But , in the present context of global climate change , there is a need to consider potential long-term effect of natal condition to better understand and predict the consequence of these change on population dynamic . The environmental condition affecting offspring during their early development may determine their lifetime reproductive performance , and therefore the number of recruit produced by a cohort . In this study , we attempted to link recruitment to natal and recent ( previous year ) condition in the long-lived black-browed albatross ( Thalassarche melanophrys ) at Kerguelen Islands . The environmental variability wa described using both climatic variable over breeding ( sea surface temperature anomaly ) and non-breeding ground ( Southern Oscillation index ) , and variable related to the colony ( breeding success and colony size ) . Immature survival wa linked to the breeding success of the colony in the year of birth , which wa expected to reflect the average seasonal parental investment . At the cohort level , this initial mortality event may act a a selective filter shaping the number , and presumably the quality ( breeding frequency , breeding success probability ) , of the individual that recruit into the breeding population . The decision to start breeding wa strongly structured by the age of the individual and adjusted according to recent condition . An effect of natal condition wa not detected on this parameter , supporting the selection hypothesis . Recruitment , a a whole , wa thus influenced by a combination of long- and short-term environmental impact . Our result highlight the complexity of the influence of environmental factor on such long-lived specie , due to the time-lag ( associated with a delayed maturity ) between the impact of natal condition on individual and their repercussion on the breeding population .

aVMud volcanism is a global phenomenon usually associated with compressional tectonics that favour extrusion of fluid-and clay mineral-rich sediment both on land and offshore . Methane , the dominant gas phase , is emitted at variable rate during and after emplacement of the mud dome . In case of continental mud volcano , the gas is directly released into the atmosphere , thereby contributing to global warming . Azerbaijan is one of the country with one of the highest abundance of mud dome globally . One of the most prominent mud volcano , Dashgil , ha been chosen for a case study because of it historic record of violent eruption , continued activity , and well-documented regional geology in the Caucasus orogenic wedge adjacent to the Caspian Sea . Since 2003 , gas flux ha quantitatively measured at one of the two crater lake and is characterized by valve-type behaviour and episodically violent degassing . In 2007 , the large crater lake wa additionally equipped with methane fluxmeter a well a an in situ pore-pressure probe into the conduit . Our data are complemented by regional seismicity , and exhibit the following result : ( 1 ) there seems to be a significant correlation between change in pore pressure in the conduit feeding the main crater lake and the rate of gas escape ; ( 2 ) change in gas-flux rate appear to be independent of local seismicity , in particular since no larger EQs have been recorded since 2003 ; ( 3 ) despite discontinuous monitoring owing to technical failure , we observe an overall increase in methane emission with time ; ( 4 ) nearby earthquake activity ( < M4.6 ) can be correlated with pore-pressure transient recorded by the piezometer , which reach up to 2.4 kPa compared to the pre-seismic value ; ( 5 ) from time to time , there are strong lake-level fluctuation decoupled from precipitation or evaporation , which are explained by sub-bottom hydraulic communication between the two crater lake and adjacent gryphon . The wealth of observation lead u to conclude that monitoring gas flux and pore pressure provides important time series data for both methane emission into the atmosphere and pore pressure a a proxy for co-seismic strain .

aVThe greenhouse gas budget of 15 European crop site covering a large climatic gradient and corresponding to 41 site-years were estimated . The site included a wide range of management practice ( organic and/or mineral fertilisation , tillage or ploughing , with or without straw removal , with or without irrigation , etc . ) and were cultivated with 15 representative crop specie common to Europe . At all site , carbon input ( organic fertilisation and seed ) , carbon export ( harvest or fire ) and net ecosystem production ( NEP ) , measured with the eddy covariance technique , were calculated . The variability of the different term and their relative contribution to the net ecosystem carbon budget ( NECB ) were analysed for all site-years , and the effect of management on NECB wa assessed . To account for greenhouse gas ( GHG ) flux that were not directly measured on site , we estimated the emission caused by field operation ( EFO ) for each site using emission factor from the literature . The EFO were added to the NECB to calculate the total GHG budget ( GHGB ) for a range of cropping system and management regime . N ( 2 ) O emission were calculated following the IPCC ( 2007 ) guideline , and CH ( 4 ) emission were estimated from the literature for the rice crop site only . At the other site , CH ( 4 ) emissions/oxidation were assumed to be negligible compared to other contribution to the net GHGB . Finally , we evaluated crop efficiency ( CE ) in relation to global warming potential a the ratio of C exported from the field ( yield ) to the total GHGB . On average , NEP wa negative ( -284 +/- 228 gC m ( -2 ) year ( -1 ) ) , and most cropping system behaved a atmospheric sink , with sink strength generally increasing with the number of day of active vegetation . The NECB wa , on average , 138 +/- 239 gC m ( -2 ) year ( -1 ) , corresponding to an annual loss of about 2.6 +/- 4.5 % of the soil organic C content , but with high uncertainty . Management strongly influenced the NECB , with organic fertilisation tending to lower the ecosystem carbon budget . On average , emission caused by fertiliser ( manufacturing , packaging , transport , storage and associated N ( 2 ) O emission ) represented close to 76 % of EFO . The operation of machinery ( use and maintenance ) and the use of pesticide represented 9.7 and 1.6 % of EFO , respectively . On average , the NEP ( through uptake of CO ( 2 ) ) represented 88 % of the negative radiative forcing , and exported C represented 88 % of the positive radiative forcing of a mean total GHGB of 203 +/- 253 gC-eq m ( -2 ) year ( -1 ) . Finally , CE differed considerably among crop and according to management practice within a single crop . Because the CE wa highly variable , it is not suitable at this stage for use a an emission factor for management recommendation , and more study are needed to ass the effect of management on crop efficiency .

aVThis paper examines potential land use change in Africa under climate change by building an integrated model of crop management , animal husbandry , and forestry . Using micro-level decision from around 9000 household survey in 11 country , we analyze the choice of land type across the landscape with a multinomial discrete choice model . The choice and future adaptation measure are analyzed a a mosaic based on the typology of Agro-Ecological Zones . The result indicate that if climate becomes hotter and drier , Africa will adapt by increasing a joint production of crop and animal , especially in the lowland savannah . On the other hand , if climate becomes wetter , it will switch more to forest , either with crop or with both crop and livestock , especially in the mid and high elevation humid zone . Forestry will play a significant role in adaptation when a substantial increase in precipitation make animal husbandry an unattractive alternative .

aVDevelopment of a material recycling process for waste concrete is an urgent issue . This paper summarizes the current situation of the issue , and introduces new waste concrete recycling process via carbonic acid treatment . In the process , alkaline calcium compound in the hydrated cement part of waste concrete are extracted and precipitated a calcium carbonate ( CaCO ( 3 ) ) . By utilizing this reaction , CaCO ( 3 ) and clay alternative material can be produced from waste cement particle . Furthermore , combined use of the carbonic acid treatment and conventional mechanical grinding allows fine aggregate to be recycled from waste concrete . The process doe not need any additional material except water and carbon dioxide ( CO ( 2 ) ) . The process is considered to be a promising option for waste concrete recycling .

aVP > 1 . Maternal effect may play an important role in shaping the life history of organism . Using an insect herbivore , the winter moth ( Operophtera brumata ) feeding on oak ( Quercus robur ) , we show that maternal effect can affect seasonal timing of egg hatching in an herbivore in an adaptive way . 2 . Winter moth egg-hatching need to coincide with oak bud opening , a only freshly emerged leaf are suitable a food for the caterpillar . However , there is spatial variation in the timing of bud opening among oak to which the winter moth need to adapt . 3 . We show experimentally that the generation time between the mother 's and her offspring ' hatching date wa shorter for mother who hatched late relative to bud opening of the tree they had to feed on ( and hence had to feed on older leaf ) than for mother ' who hatched on time . Maternal feeding condition affected both the larval and the pupal development time of the mother a well a the egg development time of her offspring : at all three stage developmental time wa shorter for the mistimed treatment . 4 . We thus show that adaptation to spatial variation may be achieved via maternal effect . While this is a mechanism selected to adapt to spatial variation , it may now also play a role in adaptation to climate change induced shift in host phenology , and allow insect herbivore to adapt to change in the seasonal timing of their food availability without the need for genetic change .

aVCoral reef are thought to face significant threat from global warming due to increased water temperature and ocean acidity . However , research into the surface energy balance of coral reef and their associated micrometeorology is rare . Here we present , through a case study approach , the first direct in situ measurement of the surface energy balance of Heron Reef , a small platform coral reef in the southern Great Barrier Reef , Australia . Surface energy exchange were measured using the eddy covariance method and show that during winter and spring an estimated 80-98 % of net radiation go into heating of the water overlaying the reef and reef substrate . As a result , cloud cover is considered the dominant control on heating of the reef flat environment . Change in cloud cover may therefore significantly affect the thermal environment of coral reef and their ecology . Sensible and latent heat flux reached their highest value during wintertime advection of dry and cool continental air blowing from mainland Australia . This resulted in a net loss of energy from the reef flat and a decreasing trend in water temperature . Turbulent flux otherwise remained small , with sensible heat flux often close to zero . Results indicate that coral reef may act a heat sink during winter and a heat source during spring , thereby affecting local water and atmosphere heat budget and associated thermodynamics .

aVTo address the worsening problem of global warming and the urban heat island effect , ecological city and building environment greening are being promoted in population-dense urban area domestically and abroad . For example , the Japanese Ministry of Land , Infrastructure , Transport , and Tourism announced the CASBEE-HI ( Heat Island ) assessment system in 2008 a a response to worsening urban warming and urban heat island effect . The Ministry implemented `` Building Space Greening Plans '' in Tokyo , Osaka , and other city , enforcing by law the effective reduction of urban temperature and improving urban living environment and alleviating the threat of urban ecological disaster . Therefore , this study integrates Taiwan domestic and foreign building space greening design , derived greening benefit , implementation promotion method , and greening design policy a measurement construct to examine the mutual influence between different construct and to analyze the degree of influence on the urban real estate market . From the result , demonstrating that building space environment greening design doe bring about positive benefit . In addition , the greening benefit wa shown to have a positive impact on the urban real estate market . At the same time , greening promotion implementation method and urban policy standard both had a positive impact on the urban real estate market , demonstrating that government promotion of building environment greening design through urban design policy mean is acceptable to the public .

aVCarbon dioxide is produced by metamorphic reaction in Erogenic belt and high-heat-flow system . Part of this carbon is ultimately released to the atmosphere , but the long timescale of regional metamorphism implies that the short-term effect on the environment are minor . However , contact metamorphism around igneous sill intrusion in organic-rich sedimentary basin ha the potential to generate huge volume of CH ( 4 ) and CO ( 2 ) , and these gas are rapidly released to the atmosphere through vertical pipe structure . The high flux and volume of greenhouse gas produced in this way suggest that contact metamorphic process could have a first-order influence on global warming and mass extinction .

aVThe total methane emission to the atmosphere and hydrosphere , and it seasonal variation , were estimated using an enclosed static chamber technique from a tidal marsh dominated by Phragmites australis ( common reed ) in the Min River estuary , southeast China . Measurements were taken at three tidal stage ( before flood , during the flooding and ebbing process , and after ebb ) . Potential rate of methane production from the marsh sediment layer were also measured using an incubation technique . This P. australis tidal marsh wa a net methane source , emitting 32.59 and 6.87 g CH ( 4 ) .m ( -2 ) .yr ( -1 ) to the atmosphere and hydrosphere , respectively . There wa considerable monthly variation with emission greater before flood in some month , whereas at other month emission wa greater after ebb . The average methane flux were 5.13 , 5.06 and 4.74 mg CH ( 4 ) m ( -2 ) h ( -1 ) before flood , during flooding and ebbing , and after ebb , respectively . Emissions to the tidewater and the atmosphere during the flooding and ebbing process were 2.98 and 2.08 mg CH ( 4 ) m ( -2 ) h ( -1 ) , respectively . Sediment methane production potential ( 0-40 cm depth ) ranged from 0.028-0.123 mu g CH ( 4 ) .g ( -1 ) .d ( -1 ) , with the greatest production wa in the surface soil . Methane flux had a significant correlation with atmospheric , sediment temperature and above ground biomass . The implication of these data for global warming are discussed briefly .

aVMethane emission from ruminant livestock are considered to be one of the more potent form of greenhouse gas contributing to global warming . Many strategy to reduce emission are targeting the methanogen that inhabit the rumen , but such an approach can only be successful if it target all the major group of ruminant methanogen . Therefore , basic knowledge of the diversity of these microbe in breed of buffalo is required . Therefore , the methanogenic community in the rumen of Surti buffalo wa analyzed by PCR amplification , cloning , and sequencing of methyl coenzyme M reductase ( mcrA ) gene . A total of 76 clone were identified , revealing 14 different sequence ( phylotypes ) . All 14 sequence were similar to methanogen belonging to the order Methanobacteriales . Within Methanobacteriales , 12 clone ( 6 OTUs ) were similar to Methanosphaera stadtmanae and the remaining 8 phylotypes ( 64 clone ) were similar to unclassified Methanobacteriales . Overall , member of the Methanobacteriales dominated the mcrA clone library in the rumen of Surti buffalo . Further study and effective strategy can be made to inhibit the growth of Methanobacteriales to reduce methane emission from the rumen which would help in preventing global warming .

aVBased on transient simulation of the last deglaciation ( significant global warming period ) using a fully coupled model and sensitivity experiment , we show explicitly how the thermohaline circulation ( THC ) affect the climate of China , especially during period of abrupt climate change . The simulated evolution of the Chinese climate wa consistent with the paleoclimate record during the last deglaciation . For example , the whole Chinese region warmed significantly during the Bolling-Allerod warming event ( BA ) . When the magnitude of the THC wa reduced in the sensitivity experiment during BA , warming of the Chinese region wa greatly affected . Our work show that in addition to orbital forcing and greenhouse gas , the THC is an important factor influencing climate change in China at the century scale .

aVClimate change is likely to have major implication for wetland ecosystem , which will include altered water level regime due to modification in local and catchment hydrology . However , substantial uncertainty exists in the precise impact of climate change on wetland due in part to uncertainty in GCM projection . This paper explores the impact of climate change upon river discharge within three sub-catchments of Loktak Lake , an internationally important wetland in northeast India . This is achieved by running pattern-scaled GCM output through distributed hydrological model ( developed using MIKE SHE ) of each sub-catchment . The impact of climate change upon water level within Loktak Lake are subsequently investigated using a water balance model . Two group of climate change scenario are investigated . Group 1 us result from seven different GCMs for an increase in global mean temperature of 2 A degree C , the purported threshold of ''dangerous '' climate change , whilst Group 2 is based on result from the HadCM3 GCM for increase in global mean temperature between 1 A degree C and 6 A degree C. Results from the Group 1 scenario show varying response between the three sub-catchments . The majority of scenario-sub-catchment combination ( 13 out of 21 ) indicate increase in discharge which vary from < 1 % to 42 % although , in some case , discharge decrease by a much a 20 % . Six of the GCMs suggest overall increase in river flow to Loktak Lake ( 2-27 % ) whilst the other result in a modest ( 6 % ) decline . In contrast , the Group 2 scenario lead to an almost linear increase in total river flow to Loktak Lake with increasing temperature ( up to 27 % for 6 A degree C ) , although two sub-catchments experience reduction in mean discharge for the smallest temperature increase . In all but one Group 1 scenario , and all the Group 2 scenario , Loktak Lake water level are higher , regularly reaching the top of a downstream hydropower barrage that impounds the lake and necessitating the release of water for barrage structural stability . Although elevated water level may permit enhanced abstraction for irrigation and domestic us , future increase in hydropower generation are limited by existing infrastructure . The higher water level are likely to exacerbate existing ecological deterioration within the lake a well a enhancing problem of flooding of lakeside community .

aVAtmospheric moisture transport from the Atlantic to the Pacific basin play an important role in regulating North Atlantic salinity and thus the strength of the thermohaline circulation . Potential change in the strength of this moisture transport are investigated for two different climate-change scenario : North Atlantic cooling representative of Heinrich event , and increased greenhouse gas ( GHG ) forcing . The effect of North Atlantic cooling is studied using a coupled regional model with comparatively high resolution that successfully simulates Central American gap wind and other important aspect of the region . Cooler North Atlantic sea surface temperature ( SST ) in this model lead to a regional decrease of atmospheric moisture but also to an increase in wind speed across Central America via an anomalous pressure gradient . The latter effect dominates , resulting in a 0.13 Sv ( 1 Sv = 10 ( 6 ) m ( 3 ) s ( -1 ) ) increase in overall moisture transport to the Pacific basin . In fresh water forcing simulation with four different general circulation model , the wind speed effect is also present but not strong enough to completely offset the effect of moisture decrease except in one model . The influence of GHG forcing is studied using simulation from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change archive . In these simulation atmospheric moisture increase globally , resulting in an increase of moisture transport by 0.25 Sv from the Atlantic to Pacific . Thus , in both scenario , moisture transport change act to stabilize the thermohaline circulation . The notion that the Andes effectively block moisture transport from the Atlantic to the Pacific basin is not supported by the simulation and atmospheric reanalyses examined here . This indicates that such a blocking effect doe not exist or else that higher resolution is needed to adequately represent the steep orography of the Andes .

The satellite land image for 2005 is considered to be the most significant one . This is considered to be the highest level of degradation since 1953 . The water degradation in the lake wa fitted by linear regression and the best fitting for the calculated surface area for the water can be presented by a polynomial equation .

aVBased on the carbon nitrogen cycle and greenhouse gas ( GHG ) mitigation and emission process related to straw return and burning , a compound greenhouse gas budget model , the `` Straw Return and Burning Model '' ( SRBM ) , wa constructed to estimate the net mitigation potential of straw return to the soil in China . As a full GHG budget model , the SRBM addressed the following live process : ( 1 ) soil carbon sequestration , ( 2 ) mitigation of synthetic N fertilizer substitution , ( 3 ) methane emission from rice paddy , ( 4 ) additional fossil fuel use for straw return , and ( 5 ) CH ( 4 ) and N ( 2 ) O emission from straw burning in the field . Two comparable scenario were created to reflect different degree of implementation for straw return and straw burning . With GHG emission and mitigation effect of the five process converted into global warming potential ( GWP ) , the net GHG mitigation wa estimated . We concluded that ( I ) when the full greenhouse gas budget is considered , the net mitigation potential of straw return differs from that when soil carbon sequestration is considered alone ; ( 2 ) implementation of straw return across a larger area of cropland in 10 province ( i.e. , Shanghai , Jiangsu , Zhejiang , Fujian , Jiangxi , Hubei , Hunan , Guangdong , Guangxi , and Hainan ) will increase net GHG emission ; ( 3 ) if straw return is promoted a a feasible mitigation measure in the remaining province , the total net mitigation potential before soil organic carbon ( SOC ) saturation will be 71.89 Tg CO ( 2 ) equivalent ( eqv ) /yr , which is equivalent to 1.733 % of the annual carbon emission from fossil fuel use in China in 2003 ; ( 4 ) after SOC saturation , only 13 of 21 province retain a relatively small but permanent net mitigation potential , while in the others the net GHG mitigation potential will gradually diminish ; and ( 5 ) the major obstacle to the feasibility or permanence of straw return a a mitigation measure is the increased CH ( 4 ) emission from rice paddy . The paper also suggests that comparable scenario in which all the related carbon nitrogen cycle are taken into account be created to estimate the mitigation potential of organic waste in different utilization and treatment .

aV1 . Temperate region with fish community dominated by cold-water specie ( physiological optimum 28 degree C ) that are able to establish and invade a the thermal constraint on the expression of their life history trait diminish . 2 . England and Wales is a temperate region into which at least 38 freshwater fish have been introduced , although 14 of these are no longer present . Of the remaining 24 specie , some have persisted but failed to establish , some have established population without becoming invasive and some have become invasive . The aim of the study wa to predict the response of these 24 non-native fish to the warming temperature of England and Wales predicted under climate change in 2050 . 3 . The predictive use of climate-matching model and an air and water temperature regression model suggested that there are six non-native fish currently persistent but not established in England and Wales whose establishment and subsequent invasion would benefit substantially from the predicted warming temperature . These included the common carp Cyprinus carpio and European catfish Silurus glanis , fish that also exert a relatively high propagule pressure through stocking to support angling and whose spatial distribution is currently increasing significantly , including in open system . 4 . The potential ecological impact of the combined effect of warming temperature , current spatial distribution and propagule pressure on the establishment and invasion of C. carpio and S. glanis were assessed . The ecological consequence of C. carpio invasion were assessed a potentially severe in England and Wales , with impact likely to relate to habitat destruction , macrophyte loss and increased water turbidity . However , evidence of ecological impact of S. glanis elsewhere in their introduced range wa le clear and so their potential impact in England and Wales remain uncertain .

aVDemand for nonsolar energy and concern about the implication of fossil fuel combustion have encouraged examination of energy use associated with agriculture . The United States is a global leader in pig production , and the United States swine industry is centered in Iowa . Feed is the largest individual input in pig production , but the energy consumption of the Iowa swine feed production chain ha yet to be critically examined . This analysis examines nonsolar energy use and resulting 100-yr global warming potential ( GWP ) associated with the swine feed production chain , beginning with cultivation of crop and concluding with diet formulation . The nonsolar energy use and accompanying 100-yr GWP associated with production of 13 common swine feed ingredient are estimated . Two diet formulation strategy are considered for 4 crop sequence x ingredient choice combination to generate 8 crop sequence x diet formulation scenario . The first formulation strategy ( simple ) doe not include synthetic AA or phytase . The second strategy ( complex ) reduces CP content of the diet by using L-lysine to meet standardized ileal digestibility lysine requirement of pig and includes the exogenous enzyme phytase . Regardless of crop sequence x diet formulation scenario , including the enzyme phytase is energetically favorable and reduces the potential excretion of P by reducing or removing inorganic P from the complete diet . Including L-lysine reduces the CP content of the diet and requires le nonsolar energy to deliver adequate standardized ileal digestible lysine than simply feeding soybean meal . Replacing soybean meal with full-fat soybean is not energetically beneficial under Iowa condition . Swine diet including dried distiller grain with solubles and crude glycerol require approximately 50 % more nonsolar energy input than corn-soybean meal diet or corn-soybean meal diet including oat . This study provides essential information on cultivation , processing , and manufacture of swine feed ingredient in Iowa that can be coupled with other model to estimate the nonsolar energy use and 100-yr GWP of pig production .

aVDespite the well-documented effect of global climate change on terrestrial specie ' range , eco-geographical region a the regional scale of ecosystem have been poorly studied especially in China with diverse climate and ecosystem . Here we analyse the shift of temperature zone in eco-geographical study over China using projected future climate scenario . Projected climate data with high resolution during 1961-2080 were simulated using regional climate model of PRECIS . The number of day with mean daily temperature above 10 degree C and the mean temperature of January are usually regarded a the principal criterion to indicate temperature zone , which are sensitive to climate change . Shifts due to future climate change were calculated by comparing the latitude of grid cell for the future borderline of one temperature zone with that for baseline period ( 1961-1990 ) . Results indicated that the range of Tropical , Subtropical , Warm Temperate and Plateau Temperate Zones would be enlarged and the range of Cold Temperate , Temperate and Plateau Sub-cold Zones would be reduced . Cold Temperate Zone would probably disappear at late this century . North borderline of temperature zone would shift northward under projected future climate change , especially in East China . Farthest shift of the north boundary of Plateau Temperate , Subtropical and Warm Temperate Zones would be 3.1 degree , 5.3 degree and 6.6 degree latitude respectively . Moreover , northward shift would be more notably in northern China a future temperature increased .

aVResearches on HO ( x ) radical chemistry would provide theoretical support for understanding the global climate change and regional air pollution control . At present stage , comprehensive field campaign including HO ( x ) radial measurement is one of the critical approach to advance it . However , due to the very short lifetime and extremely low concentration of HO ( x ) in the atmosphere , direct measurement of HO ( x ) radical is one of most challenged work in atmospheric chemistry . This paper review the direct measurement technique of the HO ( x ) radical , summarizes the observed dynamic range of it concentration , introduces the current schematic diagram of the HO ( x ) radical chemistry and the important contribution from previous field study , and discus the main scientific question that need further research . Besides , the progress of the HO ( x ) radical chemistry in China is reviewed , and several potentially important research direction are pointed out .

aVOxygen minimum zone ( OMZs ) below near-surface optimum in the eastern tropical sea are among the largest contiguous area of naturally occurring hypoxia in the world ocean , and are predicted to expand and shoal with global warming . In the eastern tropical Pacific ( ETP ) , the surface mixed layer is defined by a shallow thermocline above a barrier of cold hypoxic water , where dissolved oxygen level are < 3.5 mL L-1 . This thermocline ( similar to 25-50 m ) constitutes a lower hypoxic habitat boundary for high oxygen demand tropical pelagic billfish and tuna ( i.e. , habitat compression ) . To evaluate similar oceanographic condition found in the eastern tropical Atlantic ( ETA ) , we compared vertical habitat use of 32 sailfish ( Istiophorus platypterus ) and 47 blue marlin ( Makaira nigricans ) monitored with pop-up satellite archival tag in the ETA and western North Atlantic ( WNA ) . Both specie spent significantly greater proportion of their time in near-surface water when inside the ETA than when in the WNA . We contend that the near-surface density of billfish and tuna increase a a consequence of the ETA OMZ , therefore increasing their vulnerability to overexploitation by surface gear . Because the ETA OMZ encompasses nearly all Atlantic equatorial water , the potential impact of overexploitation are a concern . Considering the obvious difference in catchability inside and outside the compression zone , it seems essential to standardize these catch rate separately to minimize inaccuracy in stock assessment for these specie . This is especially true in light of global warming , which will likely exacerbate future compression impact .

aVWe addressed the potential for climate change to facilitate invasion and precipitate shift in community composition by testing effect of ocean warming on specie in a marine fouling community in Bodega Harbor , Bodega Bay , California , USA . First , we determined that introduced specie tolerated significantly higher temperature than native , suggesting that climate change will have a disproportionately negative impact on native specie . Second , we assessed the temperature dependence of survival and growth by exposing juvenile to an ambient control temperature and increased temperature predicted by ocean warming scenario ( +3 degree C and +4.5 degree C ) in laboratory mesocosms . We found that response differed between specie , specie origin , and demographic process . Based on the temperature tolerance , survival , and growth result , we predict that , a ocean temperature increase , native specie will decrease in abundance , whereas introduced specie are likely to increase in this system . Facilitation of invasion by climate change may already be underway ; locally , invasive dominance ha increased concurrent with ocean warming over the past similar to 40 year . We suggest that the effect of climate change on community can occur via both direct impact on the diversity and abundance of native specie and indirect effect due to increased dominance of introduced specie .

aVThis paper is devoted to a brief critical review of major achievement and shortcoming in numerical modeling of climatic characteristic of the World Ocean . It is shown that the most interesting result are obtained due to the transition to high resolution ( the horizontal grid spacing being no more than 1/18A degree ) . The need to switch to higher resolution ( about 0.01A degree ) is also obvious . The author deeply appreciates the study by Guo et al . [ 25 ] in which the role of JEBAR and other term of the integral mass transport equation is assessed . High resolution , however , is not the only problem . A mathematical description of the physical process of ice formation and melting and a four-dimensional analysis of the data remain a difficult problem . It is noted that in a number of study extensive integration tends to filter out the result in a simulation of intense current . This process of Sverdrupization of the integral mass transport is shown schematically in Fig . 2 . An original scheme of the formation of the equatorial subsurface countercurrent is presented . The author suggests that neither modeling nor analyzing the resulting data show the presence of warming in the World Ocean ; hence , there is no global warming in the atmosphere either .

aVThe relationship between the rainy season and corn yield in Sao Paulo State were investigated . The result showed that rainfall and corn yield are strongly positively correlated in most of the region , particularly in the northeastern , eastern , northwestern and western part of the state ( i.e . value are higher than 0.5 significant at 95 % confidence level ) . The analysis of the trend in the duration of the rainy season and the associated accumulated precipitation showed a tendency of higher precipitation and shorter rainy season . It ha been suggested to be due to global warming . Although rainfall and crop yield were positively correlated , an increase in heavy rainfall event in future may lead to landslide , flash flood and consequently crop damage . During the period 1970-2003 there wa an increase of the rainy season and rainfall in strong El Nino episode while in the case of La Nina event the rainy season wa shorter and the rainfall decreased . Results of case study considering the 1997-98 El Nino and the 1998-99 La Nina suggested that the increase ( decrease ) of the duration of the rainy season during the El Nino ( La Nina ) event is associated with the increase ( decrease ) of corn yield in Sao Paulo State . Further study with a record of corn yield longer than 14 year and considering other El Nino/La Nina episode are needed to obtain a firm connection between corn yield and ENSO event in Sao Paulo State .

aVPower station and industrial process burning fossil fuel account for the largest percentage of carbon dioxide emission . Carbon capture and sequestration ha received enormous global attention to reduce the carbon footprint and combat global warming . Adsorption ha become an alternative technique to the conventional absorption process for capturing carbon dioxide due to it low operating and capital cost . In this study , Pressure Swing Adsorption ( PSA ) process ha been compared with Thermal Pressure Swing Adsorption ( TPSA ) process for CO , recovery from a flue gas composition of 10 % CO ( 2 ) ( by vol ) in N ( 2 ) using Ceca 13X adsorbent . A factorial design set of experiment wa performed to optimise the carbon dioxide recovery and study the effect and interaction of four control parameter namely , purge/feed flow ratio , purge time , purge gas temperature and adsorption column pressure . Results indicated that better regeneration condition used in a TPSA cycle wa essential over a PSA cycle for regaining maximum adsorption capacity of the used Ceca 13X adsorbent . It wa found that Purge time had a significant effect on the CO ( 2 ) ) recovery followed by Column pressure , purge/feed flow ratio and purge temperature . A Minitab ( R ) statistical software wa used to analyse the data . It wa found that the test of significance for lack of fit showed the fitted model to be an adequate representation of the experimental data . The result showed that to maximise the CO ( 2 ) recovery , highest value of the control parameter have to be used .

aVMediterranean stream are characterized by water flow change caused by flood and drought . When intermittency occurs in river ecosystem , hydrologic connectivity is interrupted and this affect benthic , hyporheic and flowing water compartment . Organic matter use and transport can be particularly affected during the transition from wet to dry and dry to wet condition . In order to characterize the change in benthic organic matter quantity and quality throughout a drying and rewetting process , organic matter , and enzyme activity were analyzed in the benthic accumulated material ( biofilms growing on rock and cobble , leaf , and sand ) and in flowing water ( dissolved and particulate fraction ) . The total polysaccharide , amino acid , and lipid content in the benthic organic matter were on average higher in the drying period than in the rewetting period . However , during the drying period , peptide availability decreased , a indicated by decrease in leucine aminopeptidase activity , a well a amino acid content in the water and benthic material , except leaf ; while polysaccharide were actively used , a indicated by an increase in beta-glucosidase activity in the benthic substrata and an increase in polysaccharide content of the particulate water fraction and in leaf material . During this process , microbial heterotroph were constrained to use the organic matter source of the lowest quality ( polysaccharide , providing only C ) , since peptide ( providing N and C ) were no longer available . During the flow recovery phase , the microbial community rapidly recovered , suggesting the use of refuge and/or adaptation to desiccation during the previous drought period . The scouring during rewetting wa responsible for the mobilization of the streambed and loss of benthic material , and the increase in high quality organic matter in transport ( at that moment , polysaccharide and amino acid accounted for 30 % of the total DOC ) . The dynamic of progressive and gradual drought effect , a well a the fast recovery after rewetting , might be affected by the interaction of the individual dynamic of each benthic substratum : sand sediment and leaf providing refuge for microorganism and organic matter storage , while on cobble , an active bacterial community is developed in the rewetting . Since global climate change may favor a higher intensity and frequency of drought in stream , understanding the effect of these disturbance on the material and biota could contribute to reliable resource management . The maintenance of benthic substrata heterogeneity within the stream may be important for stream recovery after drought .

aVIn recent year . China ha put great effort into the combat against global warming and the mission of zero carbon emission . However , compared with leading country such a Japan and Germany , China is still under high pressure to prosper it photovoltaic ( PV ) solar energy industry since it technology are still far behind those country . In knowledge intensive industry , a firm need to develop new product a a participant within a certain industry because knowledge ha become a critical factor that affect industry dynamic . In light of this situation , it is essential to propose a strategic policy to facilitate a firm in knowledge distribution , knowledge absorption , knowledge creation , and then to obtain competitive advantage . Until now , there ha not been such strategic policy in China . In order to fulfill this vacancy , a conceptual model is proposed . First , the proposed model examines critical characteristic of successful PV solar energy industry in China .

aVAt the parameter level , data inaccuracy , data gap , and the use of unrepresentative data have been recognized a source of uncertainty in life cycle assessment ( LCA ) . In many LCA uncertainty study , parameter distribution were created based on the measured variability or on `` rule of thumb , '' but the possible existence of correlation wa not explored . The correlation between parameter may alter the sampling space and , thus , yield unrepresentative result . The objective of this article is to describe the effect of correlation between input parameter ( and the final product ) on the outcome of an uncertainty analysis , carried out for an LCA of an agricultural product . After a theoretical discussion about the statistical concept on the creation of multivariate random distribution for a Monte Carlo simulation , a LCA case study for potato wa performed . LCA followed the International Standards Organization guideline , and the CML baseline characterization method wa applied . The functional unit wa 1 t of potato , while the input were restricted to inorganic fertilizer and pesticide . Differences among the two way to ass uncertainty ( with or without correlation ) were analyzed through Monte Carlo methodology , based on the respective estimated probability density function . In order to demonstrate the effect of correlation on the final outcome , only global warming potential , acidification , and eutrophication impact category are presented . The LCA outcome evidenced the highest environmental impact for N-based fertilizer . Environmental impact of the pesticide to the category considered wa minimum , while it contribution in the characterization phase wa lower than 10 % . Different degree of correlation were found between the input factor analyzed and also in relation with yield . Uncertainty analysis result indicated a lower uncertainty level for abiotic depletion and global warming when correlation wa taken into account , and the Monte Carlo simulation were based on a multivariate sampling space . The result presented allowed the inclusion of the existence of such correlation within the sampling space for a Monte Carlo simulation . Multivariate sampling space can be included in LCA uncertainty analysis but only if sensitivity analysis are done previously in order to identify the input factor with the highest contribution to the output uncertainty . The result of an LCA uncertainty analysis at the parameter level may lead to the wrong conclusion when the input parameter are correlated . Under a Monte Carlo procedure , the sampling space derived from univariate or multivariate normal distribution exert a varying degree of error propagation leading to different response in the uncertainty analysis .

aVTemperature is suggested to determine the upper limit of tree life . Therefore , future climate warming may be of importance for tree distribution within the European Alps , where low temperature limit carbon metabolism . We focused on the effect of air and soil temperature on net photosynthesis ( P ( n ) ) of Pinus cembra an evergreen climax specie of the timberline ecotone of the Central Austrian Alps . Light response and temperature response curve were estimated along an altitudinal gradient ranging from the forest limit up to the krummholz limit in both summer and fall . In general , P ( n ) wa significantly lower in fall a compared to summer . Nevertheless , independent from season mean P ( n ) value tended to increase with elevation and were positively correlated with root zone temperature . The specific leaf area by contrast declined with increasing elevation . Furthermore , the temperature optimum of net photosynthesis declined with increasing elevation and wa positively correlated with the mean maximum air temperature of the 10 day prior the date of measurement . Thus , our finding appear to reflect a long-term adaptation of the photosynthetic apparatus of Pinus cembra to the general temperature condition with respect to elevation combined with a short term acclimation to the prevailing temperature regime .

aVPhysiological limit determine susceptibility to environmental change , and can be assessed at the individual , population or species/lineage level . Here I discus these level in Drosophila , and consider implication for determining specie susceptibility to climate change . Limits at the individual level in Drosophila depend on experimental technique and on the context in which trait are evaluated . At the population level , evidence from selection experiment particularly involving Drosophila melanogaster indicate high level of heritable variation and evolvability for coping with thermal stress and aridity . An exception is resistance to high temperature , which reach a plateau in selection experiment and ha a low heritability/evolvability when temperature are ramped up to a stressful level . In tropical Drosophila specie , population are limited in their ability to evolve increased desiccation and cold resistance . Population limit can arise from trait and gene interaction but result from different laboratory study are inconsistent and likely to underestimate the strength of interaction under field condition . Species and lineage comparison suggest phylogenetic conservatism for resistance to thermal extreme and other stress . Plastic response set individual limit but appear to evolve slowly in Drosophila . There is more species-level variation in lower thermal limit and desiccation resistance compared with upper limit , which might reflect different selection pressure and/or low evolvability . When extreme are considered , tropical Drosophila specie do not appear more threatened than temperate specie by higher temperature associated with global warming , contrary to recent conjecture . However , specie from the humid tropic may be threatened if they can not adapt genetically to drier condition .

aVGlobal warming and escalating energy cost have provided the impetus for a worldwide movement to reduce energy consumption and the associated environmental impact arising from carbon emission . Telecommunications provider are contributing to this effort by assessing the impact of their product and offering telepresence and enhanced data service to their customer to reduce the need for travel and shipping . While greater use of service like these result in lower worldwide energy need , higher energy usage by the telecommunication provider themselves will occur unless they make change to their operation environment . There are many way to reduce the energy usage and environmental impact of telecommunication network . Choosing the most appropriate direction requires planning . Developing an optimal energy reduction plan requires an understanding of the current network , future service offering , and the technology roadmap , along with numerous additional data to support the analysis . The complexity of the planning process led Bell Labs to develop the Telecom Power Estimator . This paper describes energy usage in telecommunication network , identifies possible network change to reduce energy usage , evaluates the potential of alternative ( solar and wind ) energy use in telecommunication , and discus the business case ( including government incentive ) for implementing environmental impact reduction all in support of the eco-sustainability planning process . The Telecom Power Estimator will also be introduced , along with a discussion of how it is used to develop a holistic , cost-effective energy efficiency and eco-susta inability plan for a telecommunication network operator .

aVExtreme global climate change in the Late Neogene is well known . In Australia , climate changed from wet condition in the Late Neogene to the arid condition that characterize much of the continent today . We constrain the nature and timing of the onset of aridity in southeastern Australia by detailed stratigraphic analysis of palaeo megalake Bungunnia . The demise of the megalake ha previously been thought to herald the onset of arid climatic regime and the sedimentary record of this event ha become a proxy-type section for understanding Plio-Pleistocene climate in southern Australia . Our investigation of this sedimentary record reveal regionally extensive and correlatable aeolo-lacustrine quartz silt that represent a major and previously unrecognised step in the aridification of the continent , prior to the demise of the megalake . The age of the aeolo-lacustrine silt is constrained to be around 1.4 Ma to 1.5 Ma , just prior to the middle Pleistocene transition . The silt are preserved in a record of maximum lake fill and not long after their deposition the lake began to contract . Our data show that the youngest lake sediment , the Bungunnia Limestone , is diachronous and preserved on at least 5 distinct terrace , ranging over more than 20 m in elevation . The terrace are interpreted to represent downcutting event during arid condition , while the sediment on each terrace represent deposition during wet period . The mineralogy of the limestone preserved on these terrace change from calcite , aragonite and dolomite dominated at higher elevation to gypsum and magnesite dominated on the lower terrace , providing a unique record of the increasing amplitude of arid climatic cycle . These observation suggest that the onset of aridity in southern Australia wa progressive and step-wise , beginning significantly earlier than previously suggested . ( C ) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

aVQuantifying the elevation history of the 2000 km-wide Tibetan Plateau to an average elevation of 5 km is important for understanding key aspect of Cenozoic global climate change , collision tectonics and the evolution of the Asian monsoon , yet quantitative measure of Cenozoic surface height change across Tibet remain few and are sometimes contradictory . Here we report the first exploratory application of a modified Coexistence Approach ( CoA ) using previously published fossil pollen record to reconstruct quantitatively the Cenozoic minimum palaeoaltitudes of Gangdise-Nyainqentanglha Area of the Tibetan Plateau . GCM simulation were used to adjust Eocene and Miocene raw CoA value for secular climate change and change in palaeolatitude . This modelled correction increased the CoA-derived altitude by 895 +/- 96 m to give a minimum overall Eocene altitude of 3295-3495 m. The Miocene correction factor of 481 +/- 25 m gave an overall minimum altitude estimate of 3000-3150 m. For the Holocene CoA return four equally likely elevation of 4800-4950 m , 3800-3900 m , 3000-3100 m and 2900-3000 m. The first of these is indistinguishable from the present day regional average while the others suggest significant upslope pollen transport . Both the Eocene and Miocene palynologically-derived height estimate are consistent with suggestion of significant core plateau elevation by the Eocene , but are likely to underestimate the true palaeoelevation due to pre-Himalayan upslope pollen transport .

aVSummer heat wave have already resulted in mortality of coastal community , including ecologically important seagrass meadow . Gene expression study from controlled experiment can provide important insight a to how species/genotypes react to extreme event that will increase under global warming . In a common stress garden , we exposed three population of eelgrass , Zostera marina , to extreme sea surface temperature , simulating the 2003-European heat wave . Populations came from location widely differing in their thermal regime , two northern European location [ Ebeltoft ( Kattegat ) , Doverodde ( Limfjord , Baltic Sea ) ] , and one southern population from Gabicce Mare ( Adriatic Sea ) , allowing to test for population specificity in the response to a realistic heat stress event . Eelgrass survival and growth a well a the expression of 12 stress associated candidate gene were assessed during and after the heat wave . Contrary to expectation , all population suffered equally from 3 week of heat stress in term of shoot loss . In contrast , population markedly differed in multivariate measure of gene expression . While the gene expression profile converged to pre-stress value directly after the heat wave , stress correlated gene were upregulated again 4 week later , in line with the observed delay in shoot loss . Target gene had to be selected based on functional knowledge in terrestrial plant , nevertheless , 10/12 gene were induced relative to the control treatment at least once during the heat wave in the fully marine plant Z. marina . This study underline the importance of realistic stress and recovery scenario in studying the impact of predicted climate change .

aVAim Species in the tropic respond to global warming by altitudinal distribution shift . Consequences for biodiversity may be severe , resulting in lowland attrition , range-shift gap , range contraction and extinction risk . We aim to identify plant group ( growth form , family , endemic status ) with higher than average risk . Location South Ethiopian highland . Methods Based on observational data from mainly unexplored and remote mountain region , we applied a published model to project the consequence of an upward shift of thermal site condition on the altitudinal distribution of 475 plant specie . Annual average temperature increase of up to 5 degree C were evaluated . Differences between group of specie were analysed by a permutation procedure and Generalized Linear Models . Results Because of a limited regional specie pool , even mild warming is projected to create strong potential risk concerning lowland attrition , i.e . the net loss of specie richness because of upward range shift in the absence of new specie arriving . Likewise , many specie are expected to face range-shift gap , i.e . the absence of an overlap between future and current altitudinal range already under mild warming scenario . Altitudinal contraction and mountain-top extinction will potentially become important when warming exceeds 3.5 degree C. Mean area per specie is projected to decline by 55 % for the A2 emission scenario ( +4.2 degree C until 2100 ) because of the physical shape of the mountain . Higher than average vulnerability is expected for endemic specie a well a for herb and fern . Plant family that are especially threatened are identified . Main conclusion Lowland biotic attrition and range-shift gap a predicted by a simple model driven by shift of isotherm will result in novel challenge for preserving mountain biodiversity in the inner tropic . Whereas contraction of occupied area are expected to threaten endemic and already endangered specie in particular , we suggest that conservation priority can be identified based on simple prognostic model even without precise regional warming scenario .

aVProduction of organic carbon ( OC ) aerosol by biological activity in the ocean is hypothesized to influence climate change . We employ model sensitivity study to ass the effect of ocean ecosystem change on the marine OC flux by using an integrated Earth system model . Our modeled estimate of global marine primary OC emission ( 7 Tg OC yr ( -1 ) ) is comparable with that calculated from sensitivity simulation which us chlorophyll concentration constrained by the satellite observation . The model significantly underestimate OC concentration in summer over the remote ocean without the ocean source , but better agreement could be achieved by adding the marine source . We apply simulated perturbation in chlorophyll concentration and the sea-ice extent by previous model run for the IPCC AR4 to the OC source function only . Our model result suggest an insignificant change in the global mean primary OC flux from the ocean to the atmosphere but with considerably large spatial variability due to the change in chlorophyll concentration projected by the climate warming simulation . The major feature of the geographical distribution are increase over the Arctic Ocean , which are associated with the chlorophyll concentration and the sea-ice extent change primarily driven by the enhanced light efficiency for photosynthesis in the sea-ice free ocean . In climate chemistry and aerosol model that ignore this process , the future ( late 21st century ) surface OC concentration would be underestimated by 40-200 ng m ( -3 ) in September over the Arctic Ocean ( 70-90 degree N ) .

aVSphagnum bog in the southern Appalachian Mountains of eastern North America are rare and diverse ecosystem the unique climate range they occupy allows for a mixture of northern and southern specie to thrive creating isolated biodiversity hotspot Research on northern bog in Europe and North America ha found that climate change and atmospheric nitrogen deposition can shift specie composition of bog community and release carbon however research on southern bog ha not begun to answer question about their fate We reviewed research conducted in northern bog and applied this information to southern Appalachian bog to explore the potential impact that climate change may have on southern Sphagnum bog The projected increase in evapotranspiration coupled with nitrogen deposition may lead to the drying up of southern bog causing ( 1 ) increased decomposition rate which can lead to the system becoming a carbon source rather than a sink and ( 2 ) local extinction of many bog specie allowing alternative ecosystem to replace the bog Because of these threat we suggest a call to action for scientist and manager to begin investigating the specific Impacts that climate change will have on bog in the southeastern United States so we may better protect and conserve these unique and diverse habitat

aVThe future trajectory of forest ecosystem under climate change is heavily debated . Previous study on the impact of climate change on forest ecosystem have focused mainly on direct effect of altered climatic condition , whereas interaction with disturbance event have been largely neglected . The aim of this study is to explore interaction of drought with fire disturbance and to ass their effect on tree specie shift in the European Central Alps . Tree recruitment after a stand replacing wildfire in the Rhone valley , Switzerland , wa measured along an altitudinal temperature moisture gradient . Recruitment wa more successful in pioneer specie ( Betula pendula , Populus tremula and Salix appendiculata ) than in pre-fire stand forming ( PFSF ) specie ( Larix decidua , Picea abies and Pinus sylvestris ) . Seedling and sapling density wa not related to fire intensity , but it correlated with the distance to the forest edge in PFSF specie . The window of opportunity for seedling establishment wa short ( 1-2 year ) , and moisture deficit wa the main limiting factor for tree recruitment at lower altitude . We suggest that prolonged drought period , a projected under continued global warming , will further aggravate tree recruitment success after fire disturbance at low altitude of the Central Alps and may eventually lead to a shift from PFSF specie to either more drought-tolerant specie or to forest-free vegetation .

aVClimate change pose a huge threat to human welfare . Hence , developing a low-carbon economy ha become a prevailing and inevitable trend . Decarbonization of power generation , especially converting the current power mix into a low-carbon structure , will be a critical option for CO emission mitigation . In this paper , an integrated power generation expansion ( PGE ) planning model towards low-carbon economy is proposed , which properly integrates and formulates the impact of various low-carbon factor on PGE model . In order to adapt to the characteristic of PGE model based on low-carbon scenario , a compromised modeling approach is presented , which reasonably decrease complexity of the model , while properly keeping the significant element and maintaining moderate precision degree . In order to illustrate the proposed model and approach , a numerical case is studied based on the background of China 's power sector , making decision on the optimal PGE plan and revealing the prospect and potential for CO emission reduction .

aVCarbon dioxide capture from power plant flue gas and subsequent sequestration is expected to play a key role in mitigating global climate change . Conventional amine technology being considered for separating CO ( 2 ) from flue gas are costly , energy intensive , and if implemented , would result in large increase in the cost of producing electricity . Membranes offer potential a an energy-efficient , low-cost CO ( 2 ) capture option . Recently , working with the U.S. Department of Energy ( DOE ) , we have developed membrane with CO ( 2 ) permeances of greater than 1000 gpu and a CO ( 2 ) /N ( 2 ) selectivity of 50 at 30 degree C. This permeance is ten time higher than commercial CO ( 2 ) membrane and the selectivity is among the highest reported for non-facilitated transport material . These membrane , in combination with a novel process design that us incoming combustion air a a sweep gas to generate driving force , could meet DOE CO ( 2 ) capture cost target . Under these condition , improving membrane permeance is more important than increasing selectivity to further reduce the cost of CO ( 2 ) capture from flue gas . Membrane cost and reliability issue will be key to the eventual competitiveness of this technology for flue gas treatment . ( C ) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All right reserved .

aVMany predator-prey system are found in environment with a predominantly unidirectional flow such a stream and river . Alterations of natural flow regime ( e. g. , due to human management or global warming ) put biological population at risk . The aim of this paper is to devise a simple method that link flow speed ( current ) with population retention ( persistence ) and wash-out ( extinction ) . We consider system of prey and specialist , a well a generalist , predator , for which we distinguish the following flow speed scenario : ( a ) coexistence , ( b ) persistence of prey only or ( c ) predator only ( provided they are generalist ) , and ( d ) extinction of both population . The method is based on a reaction-advection-diffusion model and traveling wave speed approximation . We show that this approach match well spread rate observed in numerical simulation . The result from this paper can provide a useful tool in the assessment of instream flow need , estimating the flow speed necessary for preserving riverine population .

aVSix Italian research site , representative of Mediterranean and mountain forest and equipped with eddy covariance tower , were used in this study to test the performance of the CENTURY 4.5 model in predicting the dynamic of soil organic carbon ( SOC ) change during the commitment period ( CP ) of the Kyoto Protocol ( 2008-2012 ; 2013-2017 ) . We show that change in SOC stock over short period of time are difficult to detect , and explore the potential for model to be used for reporting SOC change for forest that will remain forest , under Article 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol . As the eddy covariance flux site have been active for 10 yr on average , being initiated over the period between 1996 and 1998 , the model wa evaluated by comparing the modelled SOC stock with those directly measured at each site in different year . Since long term series of observed value for soil carbon were not available , the validation of other model output such a net primary production ( NPP ) and soil nitrogen stock , give some confidence in long term simulation . Once the model performance wa evaluated , two climate change scenario , A1F1 ( world markets-fossil fuel intensive ) and B2 ( local sustainability ) , were considered for prediction of C stock change during the commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol . In general , despite the need to consider the uncertainty in the direct measurement , at each site model fit with measured SOC stock wa good , with the simulated value within the standard deviation of the measurement . In this regard , the similarity between the SOC measured in 2008 and that predicted for the two forthcoming commitment period point out the difficulty of detecting carbon stock change by direct measurement , given the closeness in time to the present of the commitment period . In any case , all site show positive variation that are possibly related to the fertilization effect of increasing CO ( 2 ) and to longer growing season , since no change in management occurred . Compared with the SOC measured in 2008 , at the end of the second commitment period , the modelled SOC variation were smaller than 2 % in the Mediterranean forest and comprised between 2 % and 7 % in the mountain forest . These variation , although small , indicate it might be possible to statistically detect difference after 10 yr in mountain forest with a reasonable number of sample . In conclusion , this work show that since SOC stock change are minimal within both CP , model can be effective tool for estimating future change in SOC amount , a an alternative to , or in support of , direct measurement when a short period of time is considered .

aVAccelerating sea level rise associated with global climate change will affect sedimentary process on coral reef and other shoreline environment by increasing energy and sediment resuspension On reef sedimentation is known to increase coral stress and bleaching a particle that settle on coral surface interfere with photosynthesis and feeding and turbidity induced by suspended sediment reduces incident light level Using relationship developed from observation of wave orbital velocity water surface elevation and suspended sediment concentration on a fringing reef flat of Molokai Hawaii prediction of the average daily maximum in suspended sediment concentration increase from similar to 11 mg/l to similar to 20 mg/l with 20 cm sea level rise The duration of time concentration exceeds 10 mg/l increase from 9 % to 37 % An evaluation of the reduction of wave energy flux through breaking and frictional dissipation across the reef flat show an increase of similar to 80 % relative to the present will potentially reach the shoreline a sea level increase by 20 cm Where the shoreline exists on low , flat terrain the increased energy could cause significant erosion of the shoreline Considering the sediment budget the sediment flux is predicted to increase and removal of fine grained sediment may be expedited on some fringing reef , and sediment in storage on the inner reef could ultimately be reduced However increased shoreline erosion may add sediment and offset removal from the reef flat The shift in sediment availability and transport that will occur a result of a modest increase in sea level have wide application to fringing coral reef elsewhere a well a other shoreline environment

aVAn improved version of the spatial ecosystem and population dynamic model SEAPODYM wa used to investigate the potential impact of global warming on tuna population . The model included an enhanced definition of habitat index , movement , and accessibility of tuna predator to different vertically migrant and non-migrant micronekton functional group . The simulation covered the Pacific basin ( model domain ) at a 2 degree x 2 degree geographic resolution . The structure of the model allows an evaluation from multiple data source , and parameterization can be optimized by adjoint technique and maximum likelihood using fishing data . A first such optimized parameterization wa obtained for bigeye tuna ( Thunnus obesus ) in the Pacific Ocean using historical catch data for the last 50 year and a hindcast from a coupled physical-biogeochemical model driven by the NCEP atmospheric reanalysis . The parameterization provided very plausible biological parameter value and a good fit to fishing data from the different fishery , both within and outside the time period used for optimization . We then employed this model to forecast the future of bigeye tuna population in the Pacific Ocean . The simulation wa driven by the physical-biogeochemical field predicted from a global marine biogeochemistry - climate simulation . This global simulation wa performed with the IPSL climate model version 4 ( IPSL-CM4 ) coupled to the oceanic biogeochemical model PISCES and forced by atmospheric CO ( 2 ) , from historical record over 1860-2000 , and under the SRES A2 IPCC scenario for the 21st century ( i.e . atmospheric CO ( 2 ) concentration reaching 850 ppm in the year 2100 ) . Potential future change in distribution and abundance under the IPCC scenario are presented but without taking into account any fishing effort . The simulation showed an improvement in bigeye tuna spawning habitat both in subtropical latitude and in the eastern tropical Pacific ( ETP ) where the surface temperature becomes optimal for bigeye tuna spawning . The adult feeding habitat also improved in the ETP due to the increase of dissolved oxygen concentration in the sub-surface allowing adult to access deeper forage . Conversely , in the Western Central Pacific the temperature becomes too warm for bigeye tuna spawning . The decrease in spawning is compensated by an increase of larva biomass in subtropical region . However , natural mortality of older stage increased due to lower habitat value ( too warm surface temperature , decreasing oxygen concentration in the sub-surface and le food ) . This increased mortality and the displacement of surviving fish to the eastern region led to stable then declining adult biomass at the end of the century . ( C ) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

aVThe Himalayas have a profound effect on the South Asian climate and the regional hydrological cycle , a it form a barrier for the strong monsoon wind and serf a an elevated heat source , thus controlling the onset and distribution of precipitation during the Indian summer monsoon . Recent study have suggested that radiative heating by absorbing aerosol , such a dust and black carbon over the Indo-Gangetic Plains ( IGP ) and slope of the Himalayas , may significantly accelerate the seasonal warming of the Hindu Kush-Himalayas-Tibetan Plateau ( HKHT ) and influence the subsequent evolution of the summer monsoon . This paper present a detailed characterization of aerosol over the IGP and their radiative effect during the premonsoon season ( April-May-June ) when dust transport constitutes the bulk of the regional aerosol loading , using ground radiometric and spaceborne observation . During the dust-laden period , there is a strong response of surface shortwave flux to aerosol absorption indicated by the diurnally averaged forcing efficiency of -70 Wm ( -2 ) per unit optical depth . The simulated aerosol single-scattering albedo , constrained by surface flux and aerosol measurement , is estimated to be 0.89 +/- 0.01 ( at similar to 550 nm ) with diurnal mean surface and top-of-atmosphere forcing value ranging from -11 to -79.8 Wm ( -2 ) and + 1.4 to + 12 Wm ( -2 ) , respectively , for the premonsoon period . The model-simulated solar heating rate profile peak in the lower troposphere with enhanced heating penetrating into the middle troposphere ( 5-6 km ) , caused by vertically extended aerosol over the IGP with peak altitude of similar to 5 km a indicated by spaceborne Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization observation . On a long-term climate scale , our analysis , on the basis of microwave satellite measurement of tropospheric temperature from 1979 to 2007 , indicates accelerated annual mean warming rate found over the Himalayan-Hindu Kush region ( 0.21 degree C/decade +/- 0.08 degree C/decade ) and underscore the potential role of enhanced aerosol solar absorption in the maximum warming localized over the western Himalayas ( 0.26 degree C/decade +/- 0.09 degree C/decade ) that significantly exceed the entire HKHT and global warming rate . We believe the accelerated warming rate reported here are critical to both the South Asian summer monsoon and hydro-glaciological resource variability in the Himalayan-Hindu Kush snowpack and therefore to the densely populated downstream region .

aVThe history of the Middle East ha been influenced by past global climatic change . Warm period caused drought , resulting in desertification , migration and war . Cold period were humid and brought prosperity and agricultural settlement to the desert fringe . The forecast based on this correlation is that the present global warming will cause the drying up of the Middle East . As in the past , this negative impact should be mitigated by using the groundwater resource stored from past wetter time . This will involve deep drilling , pumping and modern irrigation method within the framework of a new policy of 'progressive development ' , which will entail the use of currently undeveloped natural water resource beyond that of present water replenishment . While the use of the one-time groundwater reserve is taking place , a master long-term comprehensive progressive development plan for the Middle East will be prepared . This plan will include the step-by-step development of other water resource such a treated effluent , desalinated brackish groundwater and desalination of seawater .

aVClimate change represents a major challenge to the maintenance of global biodiversity . To date , the direction and magnitude of net change in the global distribution of plant diversity remain elusive . We use the empirical multi-variate relationship between contemporary water-energy dynamic and other non-climatic predictor variable to model the regional capacity for plant specie richness ( CSR ) and it projected future change . We find that across all analysed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emission scenario , relative change in CSR increase with increased projected temperature rise . Between now and 2100 , global average CSR is projected to remain similar to today ( +0.3 % ) under the optimistic B1/+1.8 degree C scenario , but to decrease significantly ( -9.4 % ) under the 'business a usual ' A1FI/+4.0 degree C scenario . Across all modelled scenario , the magnitude and direction of CSR change are geographically highly non-uniform . While in most temperate and arctic region , a CSR increase is expected , the projection indicate a strong decline in most tropical and subtropical region . Countries least responsible for past and present greenhouse gas emission are likely to incur disproportionately large future loss in CSR , whereas industrialized country have projected moderate increase . Independent of direction , we infer that all change in regional CSR will probably induce on-site specie turnover and thereby be a threat to native flora .

aVAim To project the distribution of three major forest type in the northeastern USA in response to expected climate change . Location The New England region of the United States . Methods We modelled the potential distribution of boreal conifer , northern deciduous hardwood and mixed oak-hickory forest using the process-based BIOME4 vegetation model parameterized for regional forest under historic and projected future climate condition . Projections of future climate were derived from three general circulation model forced by three global warming scenario that span the range of likely anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission . Results Annual temperature in New England is projected to increase by 2.2-3.3 degree C by 2041-70 and by 3.0-5.2 degree C by 2071-99 with corresponding increase in precipitation of 4.7-9.5 % and 6.4-11.4 % , respectively . We project that regional warming will result in the loss of 71-100 % of boreal conifer forest in New England by the late 21st century . The range of mixed oak-hickory forest will shift northward by 1.0-2.1 latitudinal degree ( c. 100-200 km ) and will increase in area by 149-431 % by the end of the 21st century . Northern deciduous hardwood are expected to decrease in area by 26 % and move upslope by 76 m on average . The upslope movement of the northern deciduous hardwood and the increase in oak-hickory forest coincide with an approximate 556 m upslope retreat of the boreal conifer forest by 2071-99 . In our simulation , rising atmospheric CO ( 2 ) concentration reduce the loss of boreal conifer forest in New England from expected loss based on climatic change alone . Main conclusion Projected climate warming in the 21st century is likely to cause the extensive loss of boreal conifer forest , reduce the extent of northern hardwood deciduous forest , and result in large increase of mixed oak-hickory forest in New England .

aVThe sulphur hexa-fluoride gas ( SF ( 6 ) ) , which is commonly used a the cover gas of molten magnesium alloy in the magnesium industry today , ha an extremely high global warming potential ( GWP ) . The protection mechanism of SF ( 6 ) containing cover gas on molten magnesium alloy wa presented . The cover gas protects the melt by reacting with the melt to form a coherent protective film on the melt surface . The film contains MgO and MgF ( 2 ) . Particles containing MgF2 form on the interface between the oxide film and the bulk magnesium alloy , which correspond to the concave area from the surface observation . These particle increase the Pilling and Bedworth ratio of surface film and enhance the protective capability of the film . Based on the understanding of the mechanism of SF ( 6 ) , a melting technology in a sealed furnace wa proposed , and the protection behavior of magnesium alloy in the sealed melting furnace wa investigated under the protective atmosphere containing HFC-134a . The morphology and composition of the surface film were also studied . Experiments to evaluate the protective effect of two other fluorine containing gas with low GWPs on AZ91D alloy in the sealed furnace were also carried out , and the result show that the new gas are potential substitute for SF ( 6 ) .

aVThe degree to which coral reef ecosystem will be impacted by global climate change depends on regional and local difference in coral ' susceptibility and resilience to environmental stressor . Here , we present data from a reciprocal transplant experiment using the common reef building coral Porites lobata between a highly fluctuating back reef environment that reach stressful daily extreme , and a more stable , neighbouring forereef . Protein biomarker analysis assessing physiological contribution to stress resistance showed evidence for both fixed and environmental influence on biomarker response . Fixed influence were strongest for ubiquitin-conjugated protein with consistently higher level found in back reef source colony both pre and post-transplant when compared with their forereef conspecific . Additionally , genetic comparison of back reef and forereef population revealed significant population structure of both the nuclear ribosomal and mitochondrial genome of the coral host ( F ( ST ) = 0.146 P < 0.0001 , F ( ST ) = 0.335 P < 0.0001 for rDNA and mtDNA , respectively ) , whereas algal endosymbiont population were genetically indistinguishable between the two site . We propose that the genotype of the coral host may drive limitation to the physiological response of these coral when faced with new environmental condition . This result is important in understanding genotypic and environmental interaction in the coral algal symbiosis and how coral may respond to future environmental change .

aVThe use of titanium dioxide ( TiO ( 2 ) ) ultrafine particulate a coating for concrete pavement have received considerable attention in recent year a these coating can trap and absorb organic and inorganic air pollutant by a photocatalytic process . Despite these promising benefit , the promotion of TiO ( 2 ) coating based on a single factor such a air quality doe not provide a complete evaluation of this technology and may omit critical environmental factor that should be considered in the selection of sustainable material . The objective of this study wa to determine the life-cycle assessment of TiO ( 2 ) coating technology based on a hybrid life-cycle methodology . To achieve this objective , a life-cycle inventory that quantifies the energy , abiotic raw material input , and emission of TiO ( 2 ) coating from cradle to grave were developed . Based on this inventory , life-cycle impact assessment of TiO ( 2 ) coating for concrete pavement wa conducted using the BEES impact assessment model . The use of titanium dioxide coating reduces the concentration of harmful pollutant by a photocatalytic process , and therefore , reduces the environmental impact in four main category : acidification , eutrophication , criterion air pollutant , and smog formation . However , during the production phase and due to the consumption of fossil energy , titanium dioxide will cause an increase in global warming , fossil fuel depletion , water intake , ozone depletion , and impact on human health . Based on the overall environmental performance of this product , life-cycle assessment show that titanium dioxide coating ha an overall beneficial effect on the environment .

aVTo address the central question of how climate change influence tree growth within the context of global warming , we used dendroclimatological analysis to understand the reaction of four major boreal tree specie - Populus tremuloides , Betula papyrifera , Picea mariana , and Pinus banksiana - to climatic variation along a broad latitudinal gradient from 46 to 54 degree N in the eastern Canadian boreal forest . Tree-ring chronology from 34 forested stand distributed at a 1 degree interval were built , transformed into principal component ( PCs ) , and analyzed through bootstrapped correlation analysis over the period 1950-2003 to identify climate factor limiting the radial growth and the detailed radial growth-climate association along the gradient . All specie taken together , previous summer temperature ( negative influence ) , and current January and March-April temperature ( positive influence ) showed the most consistent relationship with radial growth across the gradient . Combined with the identified species/site-specific climate factor , our study suggested that moisture condition during the year before radial growth played a dominant role in positively regulating P. tremuloides growth , whereas January temperature and growing season moisture condition positively impacted growth of B. papyrifera . Both P. mariana and P. banksiana were positively affected by the current-year winter and spring or whole growing season temperature over the entire range of our corridor . Owing to the impact of different climate factor on growth , these boreal specie showed inconsistent responsiveness to recent warming at the transition zone , where B. papyrifera , P. mariana , and P. banksiana would be the most responsive specie , whereas P. tremuloides might be the least . Under continued warming , B. papyrifera stand located north of 49 degree N , P. tremuloides at northern latitude , and P. mariana and P. banksiana stand located north of 47 degree N might benefit from warming winter and spring temperature to enhance their radial growth in the coming decade , whereas other southern stand might be decreasing in radial growth .

aVThe most reliable pattern of climate change is obtained using data of instrumental observation at the network of meteorological station . However , the series of such data have short timescales ( about 150 year ) . Indirect data from natural archive make it possible to judge specific feature of climate change in the more distant past . In contrast to indirect method , when data are related to temperature through statistical correlation with air temperature , the borehole geothermal method make it possible to directly determine the surface air temperature . The reconstruction of the temperature obtained using different indirect data for the Northern Hemisphere have been compared with the surface air temperature reconstruction based on the data of borehole thermometry and solar activity variation , and the possibility of using the method in order to reconstruct long-term trend in climate change have been indicated .

aVAn adequate understanding of the nature and extent of response to stressor and resource by marine foundation plant specie requires study of local adaptation and plasticity in trait . Analyses of variation among genotype in growth and morphology and genotype x environment interaction are necessary for restoration in , for example , different combination of tide , soil , and salinity regime , and for assessing how foundation plant specie will respond to global climate change . We conducted a field experiment to ass difference in response among 86 half-sibling ( same maternal tree ) seedling family of the red mangrove ( Rhizophora mangle ) to different environmental condition of hydrology imposed at low- and high-intertidal setting . At 3 year , Rhizophora survival and growth varied with maternal tree genotype , elevation , and genotype x elevation . This effect wa independent of size of propagules at planting . Growth also differed among the five island planted , a main effect that is a composite of a number of microenvironmental difference stemming from island size and shape , proximity to pass ( and thus fetch ) , and island slope . Significant genotype x island interaction for some response variable further support the hypothesis that seedling of different maternal genotype can perform very differently under various suite of environmental condition . Planted seedling reproduced at an early age , and at 3 year there were difference in reproductive output among genotype but not an overall mean difference between plant at low or high elevation . Whether our result show adaptation to local condition or difference in plasticity among genotype will require further study a the plant mature further to demonstrate fitness difference . However , either adaptation or plasticity provides a basis for maintenance of Rhizophora dominance over a wider range of environmental condition and may be important for adaptation to condition that will vary with global climate change .

aVCentral water of the North Atlantic are fundamental for ventilation of the upper ocean and are also linked to the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation ( AMOC ) . Here , we show based on benthic foraminiferal Mg/Ca ratio , that during time of enhanced melting from the Laurentide Ice Sheet ( LIS ) between 9.0-8.5 thousand year before present ( ka ) the production of central water weakened the upper AMOC resulting in a cooling over the Northern Hemisphere . Centered at 8.54 +/- 0.2 ka and 8.24 +/- 0.1 ka our dataset record two similar to 150-year cooling event in response to the drainage of Lake Agassiz/Ojibway , indicating early slow-down of the upper AMOC in response to the initial freshwater flux into the subpolar gyre ( SPG ) followed by a more severe weakening of both the upper and lower branch of the AMOC at 8.2 ka . These result highlight the sensitivity of regional North Atlantic climate change to the strength of central-water overturning and exemplify the impact of both gradual and abrupt freshwater flux on eastern SPG surface water convection . In light of the possible future increase in Greenland Ice Sheet melting due to global warming these finding may help u to better constrain and possibly predict future North Atlantic climate change .

aVThe delta ( 18 ) O data obtained from an 18.7 m ice core drilled in Chongce Ice Cap at an elevation of 6,530 m a.s.l . in the West Kunlun Mountains on the northern Tibetan Plateau show a strong correlation with the summer temperature of the middle to upper troposphere over the mid-high latitude of Eurasia . Based on this , the delta ( 18 ) O record can be used a a proxy of the June-September mean temperature of the mid-upper troposphere ( MUT ) from 1903 to 1992 . The time span of the ice core record is much longer than the meteorological data available only after 1948 . Using the empirical mode decomposition method ( EMD ) , the delta ( 18 ) O record is decomposed into various frequency component and compared with the solar irradiance variation of the same period . The result show that ( 1 ) The June-September mean temperature of the MUT over Eurasian mid-high latitude is completely decomposed into four IMF ( intrinsic mode function ) component and an increasing trend . ( 2 ) Solar irradiance is decomposed into the Schwabe cycle , the Hale cycle , the Gleissberg cycle , and an increasing trend . ( 3 ) The correlation coefficient between the June and September mean temperature of the MUT over Eurasian mid-high latitude and solar irradiance on the longer timescales ( at least more than 11-year ) show the significant correlation ; their phase change are basically identical in general , and ( 4 ) the 11-year Schwabe cycle exists in the June-September mean temperature of the MUT over Eurasian mid-high latitude during most of the time from 1903 to 1992 , and only in the two high-temperature phase ( 1929-1944 and from 1975 to the present ) may global warming disturb this relation . A full understanding of this phenomenon would shed insight into the potential consequence of global warming on the MUT .

aVCoral reef track sea level and are particularly sensitive to change in climate . Reefs are threatened by global warming , with many experiencing increased coral bleaching . Warmer sea surface temperature might enable reef expansion into mid latitude . Here we report multibeam sonar and coring that reveal an extensive relict coral reef around Lord Howe Island , which is fringed by the southernmost reef in the Pacific Ocean . The relict reef , in water depth of 25-50 m , flourished in early Holocene and covered an area more than 20 time larger than the modern reef . Radiocarbon and uranium-series dating indicates that coral grew between 9000 and 7000 year ago . The reef wa subsequently drowned , and backstepped to it modern limited extent . This relict reef , with localised re-establishment of coral in the past three millennium , could become a substrate for reef expansion in response to warmer temperature , anticipated later this century and beyond , if coral are able to recolonise it surface .

aVEndophytic fungi associated with Stipa grandis in the Inner Mongolia steppe were investigated . Thirty-four fungal taxon were identified from plant tissue obtained in four treatment where different plant functional group were removed . Nine taxon were obtained from leaf and 25 from root ; and no taxon occurred in both leaf and root . Colonization rate were significantly higher in root than in leaf . This finding differs from most previous study and may be due to the small size of the leaf which grow annually , a compared to the root which persist from year to year under the ground . Alternaria sp . 1 and Pyrenophora sp. , both isolated from leaf , were the dominant specie in the four treatment . Fusarium redolens wa dominant in the root in treatment I and II , and Phialophora sp . wa dominant in treatment III and IV . Horizontal transmission of endophytes may occur between the same and different grass specie . This would normally occur through the root , again accounting for the higher diversity . The result suggest that surrounding plant diversity or plant composition can affect endophyte community of S. grandis . If endophyte community alter with change of functional plant group , then this is likely to affect the dynamic of ecosystem functioning . Global warming and human activity can increase specie extinction , therefore , if some functional group disappear , then the fungi community will also change .

aVNumerical model including one or more fault in a rheologically stratified lithosphere show that climate-induced variation in ice and water volume on Earth 's surface considerably affect the slip evolution of both thrust and normal fault . In general , the slip rate and hence the seismicity of a fault decrease during loading and increase during unloading . Here , we present several case study to show that a postglacial slip rate increase occurred on fault worldwide in region where ice cap and lake decayed at the end of the last glaciation . Of note is that the postglacial amplification of seismicity wa not restricted to the area beneath the large Laurentide and Fennoscandian ice sheet but also occurred in region affected by smaller ice cap or lake , e. g. the Basin-and-Range Province . Our result do not only have important consequence for the interpretation of palaeoseismological record from fault in these region but also for the evaluation of the future seismicity in region currently affected by deglaciation like Greenland and Antarctica : shrinkage of the modern ice sheet owing to global warming may ultimately lead to an increase in earthquake frequency in these region .

aVThe climatic season in China , defined by station-specific daily temperature measure , have changed substantially during the past decade . In the majority of the country , the length of summer ha extended and the length of winter ha shortened since the 1950s . These change in the length of season are linked to the change in the starting date of season . Namely , the starting date of summer ha advanced and the starting date of winter ha shifted back . Averaged across the whole country , the starting date of summer ha been brought forward by 5.8 day and the season ha extended 9 day . On the other hand , the starting date of winter ha been delayed by 5.6 day and the season ha shortened by 11 day . The change for spring and fall are relatively smaller . Particularly , spring ha started earlier by 5.7 day but shortened by 0.3 day , and fall ha started later by 3.2 day but lengthened by 2.3 day . The change in season exhibit apparent regional difference . They are more significant in the north than in the south where the trend of some local change in season is opposite to that of the rest of the country .

aVWe studied the sensitivity of reference evapotranspiration ( ET ( o ) ) to global warming in Spain at the end of the 21st century . The FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation wa used to estimate ET ( o ) , and we examined the sensitivity of the latter to change in temperature and relative humidity . Changes in stomatal resistance in response to increased CO ( 2 ) concentration were not evaluated , nor were the change in wind velocity and solar radiation . Different scenario were used for estimation of future ET ( o ) in different river basin a a consequence of trend in the maximum and minimum temperature and maximum and minimum humidity during the period 1973-2002 , a observed from 38 meteorological station . The temperature increase ranged between 0.3 and 0.7 degree C decade ( -1 ) , and the relative humidity fluctuated between 0.1 and -3.7 % decade ( -1 ) . Four scenario were simulated that considered the variation in linear tendency of the maximum and minimum temperature and maximum and minimum relative humidity . The trend of the 4 scenario were incorporated with the data from 338 agrometeorological station to estimate future ET ( o ) . In all case , there wa an annual increase in ET ( o ) of 11 , 21 , 36 and 7 % above the annual ET ( o ) ( 1196 mm ) for Scenarios 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 , respectively . The river basin most affected by these change wa the Ebro River valley . The most affected month were May , June , July and August , while the least affected month were November , December and January .

aVMany alpine specie are under threat from global climate change , a their geographic range become increasingly fragmented and unsuitable . Understanding rate and determinant of gene flow among such fragmented population , over historical a well a recent timescales , can help to identify population under threat . It is also important to clarify the degree to which loss of local population reduces overall genetic diversity within the taxon . The endangered Blue Mountains Water Skink ( Eulamprus leuraensis ) is restricted to < 40 small swamp in montane south-eastern Australia . Our analysis of seven microsatellite locus of 241 animal from 13 population show strong geographic structure , with major genetic divergence even between population separated by < 0.5 km . Dispersal between population is scarce , and appears to involve mostly male . Our analysis suggest potential recent bottleneck event in all the identified population , and lower genetic diversity and population size parameter at lower-elevation site than at higher-elevation site . Management of this endangered taxon thus need to treat most population separately , because of their genetic distinctiveness and low rate of genetic exchange .

aVPlacing reflector in the stratosphere or in higher-altitude space to shade sunlight is expected to be a promising geoengineering option for use a a countermeasure against climate change . While the sunshade technology ha been evaluated from earth-scientific viewpoint , no study ha evaluated when and on what scale it can be deployed from a cost-effectiveness viewpoint , presuming that it is used in combination with CO ( 2 ) abatement option a a pillar of the mitigation of climatic change . Nor have the contribution of geoengineering research and development to the economics of overall climate control measure been evaluated . Such evaluation are attempted in this study , which focus on a space-based sunshade technology . As a result , it is recommended that radiative forcing be reduced by 0.8 W/m ( 2 ) through the sunshade over a period of approximately a century from the latter half of the 21st century . In this case , an increase in global CO ( 2 ) emission by some 15 % is allowed in the former half of the 21st century , and the total climate control cost is reducible by 240 billion constant 2005 US $ on a present value basis compared to the case in which the sunshade are unavailable . To enjoy the above advantage , the mass of the sunshade stock required to offset the increase in radiative forcing due to a doubling of the atmospheric CO ( 2 ) concentration should be lower than 100 Mt/2xCO ( 2 ) assuming a continuous decline in the cost of placing ( space-launching ) sunshade from 6000 to 1000 US $ /kg over a half-century .

aVThe Sahara Slide is a giant submarine landslide on the northwest African continental margin . The landslide is located on the open continental slope offshore arid Western Sahara , with a headwall at a water depth of similar to 2000 m. High primary productivity in surface water drive accumulation of thick fine-grained pelagic/hemipelagic sediment sequence in the slide source area . Rare but large-scale slope failure , such a the Sahara Slide that remobilized approximately 600 km ( 3 ) of sediment , are characteristic of this sedimentological setting . Seismic profile collected from the slide scar reveal a stepped profile with two 100 m high headwalls , suggesting that the slide occurred retrogressively a a slab-type failure . Sediment core recovered from the slide deposit provide new insight into the process by which the slide eroded and entrained a volcaniclastic sand layer . When this layer wa entrained at the base of the slide it became fluidized and resulted in low apparent friction , facilitating the exceptionally long runout of similar to 900 km . The slide location appears to be controlled by the buried headwall of an older slope failure , and we suggest that the cause of the slide relates to differential sedimentation rate and compaction across these scarp , leading to local increase of pore pressure . Sediment core yield a date of 50-60 ka for the main slide event , a period of global sea level rise which may have contributed to pore pressure buildup . The link with sea level rising is consistent with other submarine landslide on this margin , drawing attention to this potential hazard during global warming .

aVThe number of attempt by researcher to reduce building energy consumption ha increased , ever since global warming became a serious issue . In this trend , a relatively new approach of air distribution , underfloor-air-distribution system ( UFAD ) , ha been widely used in new commercial building . This technique is simply accomplished by supplying air through a raised floor using different type of distribution configuration and outlet . In UFAD , the air is directly supplied to the occupant ' area ( occupied zone ) causing occupant plume and zone heat load stratify to the upper layer of the zone ( unoccupied zone ) , which are later extracted from return point at high level . This flow pattern give UFAD the advantage of using le energy than a conventional air-distribution system , ceiling-based air distribution ( CBAD ) due to lower pressure drop and lower air flow rate . This paper investigates the effectiveness of UFAD system in commercial building for various type of application and at different air supply temperature in a hot climate ( The State of Kuwait ) . The finding show that UFAD ha a significant saving of energy compared to CBAD ( similar to 30 % ) ; in particular with high ceiling building type , a well a providing satisfactory comfort condition for the occupant . Ultimately , more investigation should be done on conventional building height ( office ) to optimize the utilization of thermal stratification at design and operation stage .

aV[ 1 ] Long-term variability in sea surface temperature ( SST ) in the equatorial Pacific and it relationship with global warming were investigated using three SST data set ( Hadley Center Global Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature , extended reconstruction sea surface temperature , and Kaplan ) , atmospheric field from National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis , and subsurface sea temperature from the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation data set . A cooling mode in the equatorial Pacific cold tongue is evident in all three SST data set for two period : 1870-2007 and 1948-2007 . This cooling , which is indicated by the second empirical orthogonal function mode , is characterized by cooling in the Pacific cold tongue and warming elsewhere in the tropical Pacific . Its principal component time series is highly correlated with global mean surface temperature combining air temperature and SST . In association with the SST cooling mode , atmospheric field and subsurface sea temperature are coupled in the tropical Pacific during recent decade . Moreover , for the coupled model in the 20th century run ( 20C3M ) , obtained from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report database , those with realistic feature of El Nino-Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) event can well show the cooling mode . However , the cooling mode is not shown in these coupled model in a preindustrial scenario with no forcing attributed to global warming . Results from observation and model suggest that the cooling mode is very likely caused by global warming . This conclusion is supported by a hypothesis that considers dynamic effect in the equatorial Pacific Ocean in response to global warming .

aVSeasonal and interannual dynamic of cladoceran specie were analyzed during the period 1995-2003 in two deep peri-alpine lake morphologically different but subjected to similar regional climatic forcing . The seasonal succession of cladoceran specie wa characterized and the impact of extreme climatic event on the annual pattern of specie succession wa assessed . Using a multivariate method , we show that the cladoceran specie display marked seasonality pattern that differed in the two lake . The difference observed between the lake were driven by their trophic state , the plankton specie composition and the abundance of predator . We show that the sensitivity of the annual pattern of specie succession to extreme weather change , illustrated by the 2003 heat wave , differs markedly in these two lake . In Lake Annecy , the annual pattern of cladoceran succession observed in 2003 is not different from the one usually observed . In contrast , in Lake Geneva , the annual pattern recorded in 2003 is unusual and characterized by the maintenance of herbivorous cladocera during summer . These finding underline the need to consider the morphology of lake and trophic state in the assessment of ecological response to global warming . Our result contribute to the debate about the predictability of the impact of climate change on aquatic ecosystem , and their extrapolation from one site to another .

aVSedimentological , geochemical and particle-size analysis were used to reconstruct the evolution of both trophic state and hypolimnetic anoxia in Lake Bourget ( French Alps ) during the last century . Radionuclide dating ( ( 210 ) Pb , ( 137 ) Cs and ( 241 ) Am ) confirmed the annual rhythm of lamination in the upper sediment profile . In Lake Bourget , biochemical varves are triplet composed of a diatom layer ( spring lamina ) , a bio-precipitated calcite-rich layer ( spring/summer lamina ) , and a layer rich in organic matter and detrital particle ( winter lamina ) . The onset of eutrophication and the first appearance of an anoxic facies occurred simultaneously and were dated by lamina counting to AD 1943 +/- 1 year . Persistent anoxic condition began in AD 1960 . Eutrophication is characterised by drastic increase in the flux of biogenic silica ( mostly diatom ) , lacustrine organic matter , and larger calcite crystal ( 15-30 mu m ) . The increase of organic matter also represents a marker of the onset of anoxic condition in the hypolimnion . Our result show that eutrophication wa the main factor controlling anoxia in the hypolimnion . This eutrophication wa caused mostly by the inflow of untreated sewage effluent , and to a lesser extent , by input of fertilizer-derived phosphorus during flood of the Rhone River and run-off from the lake catchment . The Rhone River , however , can also be a source of re-oxygenation via underflows that originate during flood event . Oxygenation of the hypolimnion is also controlled by low winter temperature , which enable turnover of the lake . Thus , global warming , associated with a forecasted reduction in precipitation , might reduce the efficiency of hypolimnetic re-oxygenation in Lake Bourget .

aVMunicipal Drinking Water Distribution Systems ( MDWDSs ) consume a significant quantity of energy to transport water , thereby exacerbating greenhouse gas emission and global climate change . The current study is a sensitivity analysis that us a network solver to quantify energy saving due to the alteration of three system propertiessystem-wide water demand , storage tank parameter ( maximum water level , diameter , elevation ) , and pumping station ( horsepower , number of booster , and their location ) of seven diverse MDWDSs . It wa found that a 50 % reduction in water demand , main pump horsepower , and booster horsepower resulted in an average energy saving of 47 , 41 , and 9.5 % respectively , for the seven system analyzed . Other property examined showed insignificant saving . Even though an individual system analysis is more conclusive , this sensitivity analysis can guide optimization study to focus on the most sensitive property .

aVBackground , aim and scope In spite of a number of lingering issue , life cycle assessment ( LCA ) is widely recognised a one of the most powerful tool to investigate the environmental performance of a product or service . Carbon footprint ( CF ) analysis can also be considered a subset of LCA , limited to a single impact category ( i.e . global warming potential ( GWP ) ) . However , the inherent complexity of a full LCA or CF analysis often stand in the way of their widespread application in the industry and policy-making sector . For these latter ambit , this paper advocate the adoption of tailor-made streamlined approach , with reduced inventory requirement and impact assessment scope . Two such example are provided , respectively addressing the evaluation of GWP in the development of new product standard and the GWP saving attainable through the use of recycled material . Materials and method Both the application example presented here are firmly rooted in life cycle thinking , and follow the guideline provided by the current ISO standard on LCA . At the same time , the employed model are structured in such a way a not to require the deployment of specific LCA software but rely on simple algorithm instead , complemented by table of data for the associated background process sourced from standard life cycle inventory database . Results In the first example , the simplified algorithm wa found to produce reliable and satisfactorily accurate result in term of GWP , i.e . within 10 % of those produced by a fully fledged LCA performed in parallel for validation purpose . In the second example , the adopted simplification only applied to the goal of the study ( i.e . assessment of the absolute GWP saving , with no quantitative indication of their relative extent with respect to the total ) . Within these limit , the proposed simplified tool provided accurate indication , which enabled a clear ranking of the analysed product , in term of desirability of recycling . Discussion To the extent possible within the given set of constraint , simplified tool such a those presented here do not lose their scientific rigour and take into account all phase of the product life cycle . Their reduced goal and scope doe of course limit the breadth of the information that they can produce , but this can be mitigated through a case-specific selection of the adopted inventory simplification and impact category/ies . Conclusions The two application example presented here have provided solid evidence that streamlined approach such a these can go a long way in facilitating the introduction of life cycle thinking and LCA in the day-today practice of industry and policy maker , while still producing scientifically sound and robust result . Recommendations and perspective Simplified LCA tool lend themselves to a wealth of possible application in the industry and policy-making sector . More case study are in order , and it will be advisable not to limit the goal and scope of all streamlined approach to carbon footprint evaluation but to pick the most relevant impact category to be included in the model on a case-by-case basis .

aVThe objective of this work wa to simulate rice grain yield in climate change scenario with increasing of current atmospheric CO ( 2 ) concentration and increase in mean air temperature in Santa Maria , RS , a well a to verify possible implication on current recommendation of sowing period . Climate change scenario for the next one hundred year considering doubled CO ( 2 ) concentration and increase of 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 degree C were used . Rice grain yield wa simulated with the InfoCrop model . Simulations were performed considering three rice cultivar - IRGA 421 , IRGA 417 and EPAGRI 109 - and seven sowing date spaced monthly from July 20 ( th ) to January 20 ( th ) . An increase in rice grain yield wa observed in the climate change scenario simulated for the three cultivar , with higher increase for the very early cultivar ( IRGA 421 ) and lower increase for the late cultivar ( EPAGRI 109 ) . If climate change take place , currently sowing period recommended for irrigated rice shall be enlarged .

aVThe global ecosystem model SEIB-DGVM wa adapted for an eastern Siberian larch forest through incorporation of empirical rule of allometry , allocation , and phenology developed for a larch stand at the Spasskaya-pad tower site , Yakutsk , Russia . After calibration , the model reconstructed post-fire successional pattern of forest structure and carbon cycling . It also reconstructed seasonal change in carbon , water , and energy cycling in a mature larch forest . Sensitivity analysis showed that simulated functional property of forest ( LAI , NPP , carbon pool , and water runoff ) are mainly determined by climatic environment , and population dynamic parameter ( i.e. , parameter for establishment and mortality ) play only minor role on them . Sensitivity analysis also showed that plant productivity and biomass were mainly limited by available water at Spasskaya-pad , where mean annual precipitation is only 257 mm . In the model , higher air temperature increase plant productivity via extension of growing season , and decrease plant productivity via causing drought and higher respiration . We found that the net effect is reduction of productivity , suggesting a possibility that global warming induces decrement of plant productivity in eastern Siberian larch forest .

aVIn alpine area , the accumulation and melting of snow control the hydrological regime . Even in watershed where glacier melt dominates , the snow pack strongly influence the stream-flow dynamic . Prognostic simulation of the response of the snow pack to climate change were conducted in a high alpine and half-glacierized basin in central Switzerland . The snow cover and glacier were simulated using a high-resolution alpine surface model . The simulation cover a reference period ( 1981-2007 ) and two prediction ( 2071-2100 ) where the measured record of temperature , precipitation and longwave radiation were modified using six regional climate model projection for two different emission scenario of greenhouse gas . The result show that the snow season shortens by one month at the beginning of the winter and by one and a half month at the end of the season , compared to today . The maximum snow water equivalent decrease by 27 % on average . The difference in the response of the snow pack to a change in climate between the emission scenario is rather small . The most pronounced effect of a warming climate are simulated for the highest altitude , where all snow completely melt during summer and no snow remains for glacier accumulation .

aVGlobal warming lead to the melting of ice cap and glacier and , consequently , the exposure of new area of land to the atmosphere and weathering . These area usually have a high reactivity to both biotic and abiotic change . Proglacial area in the Alps usually have a deglaciation time span of around 150 year ( time since the end of the `` Little Ice Age '' in the 1850 's ) . We investigated a chronosequence of very young soil in the proglacial area Morteratsch ( Swiss Alps ) to derive time-trends of soil organic matter accumulation and evolution . Total organic C and N content , C and N content of the various organic matter ( OM ) density fraction and of the labile ( oxidised by H ( 2 ) O ( 2 ) ) and stable ( H ( 2 ) O ( 2 ) -resistant ) fraction were measured . Further characterisation of OM and the various fraction wa performed using Diffuse Reflection Infrared Fourier Transform ( DRIFT ) . Soil organic matter ha been accumulated over 150 year at very high rate , value lay between 7 and 368 C/m ( 2 ) /year . This led to a soil organic matter abundance of about 1-5.5 kg C/m ( 2 ) after 140 year . Even at the start of soil formation , a very stable fraction of soil organic matter wa detectable . Stable organic matter ( resistant to the H ( 2 ) O ( 2 ) treatment ) comprised about 6 % of the total soil organic carbon and 10 % of the total nitrogen . At the start of soil formation , a very high proportion of soil organic matter wa present in the density fraction 2 g/cm ( 3 ) ) . With time , the quality of soil organic matter changed : a decrease of hydrophobicity , an increase in aromatic compound in the bulk soil and a decrease in phenolic functional group in the heaviest density fraction were detectable with increasing age . In general , stable organic matter a well a the density fraction > 2 g/cm ( 3 ) had a low C/N ratio and were enriched in proteinaceous material . The adsorption of proteinaceous material point to a strong organomineral association . This process ha existed since the very beginning of soil formation . ( C ) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

aVAlthough it account for only 4.2 % of the total global warming potential , the concern today is that aviation generated CO ( 2 ) is projected to grow to approximately 5.7 % by 2050 . Aviation emission are growing faster than any other sector and they risk undermining the progress achieved through emission cut in other area of the economy . Rapidly emerging hydrogen and fuel-cell-based technology could be developed for future replacement of on-board electrical system in `` more-electric '' or `` all-electric '' aircraft . Primary advantage of deploying these technology are low emission and low noise ( important feature for commuter airplane , which takeoff and land in urban area ) . Solid oxide fuel-cell ( SOFC ) system could result advantageous for some aeronautical application due to their capability of accepting hydrocarbon and high energy-density fuel . Moreover they are suitable for operating in combined-heat-and-power configuration , recovering heat from the high-temperature exhaust gas , which could be used to supply thermal load therefore reducing the electric power requested by the aircraft . ENFICA-FC is a project selected by the European Commission in the Aeronautics and Space priority of the Sixth Framework Programme ( FP6 ) and led by Politecnico di Torino , in Turin , Italy . One of the objective of the project is to carry out a feasibility study on a more-electric intercity aircraft ( regional jet : 32 seat ) . After the characterization of the power consumption of electrical and nonelectrical load , and the definition of a mission profile , the design of the SOFC-based energy system a well a the simulation of a complete mission is performed hypothesizing different system configuration . The simulation concern both the stack ( current and current density , cell and stack voltage , etc . ) and the balance-of-plant ( air compressor power , gross stack power , system efficiency , etc. ) . The obtained result are analyzed and discussed . [ DOI : 10.1115/1.3176282 ]

aVThe changing availability of freshwater resource is likely to be one of the most important consequence of projected 21st century climate change for both human and natural system . However , substantial uncertainty remains regarding the precise impact of climate change on water resource , due in part due to uncertainty in GCM projection of climate change . Here we explore the potential impact of climate change on freshwater resource in a humid , tropical catchment ( the River Mitano ) in the Upper Nile Basin of Uganda . Uncertainty associated with GCM structure and climate sensitivity is explored , a well a parameter specification within hydrological model . These aim are achieved by running pattern-scaled output from seven GCMs through a semi-distributed hydrological model of the catchment ( developed using SWAT ) . Importantly , use of pattern-scaled GCM output allows investigation of specific threshold of global climate change including the purported 2 A degree C threshold of 'dangerous ' climate change . In-depth analysis of result based on the HadCM3 GCM climate scenario show that annual river discharge first increase , then decline with rising global mean air temperature . A coincidental shift from a bimodal to unimodal discharge regime also result from a projected reduction in baseflow ( groundwater discharge ) . Both of these change occur after a 4 A degree C rise in global mean air temperature . These result are , however , highly GCM dependent , in both the magnitude and direction of change . This dependence stem primarily from projected difference in GCM scenario precipitation rather than temperature . GCM-related uncertainty is far greater than that associated with climate sensitivity or hydrological model parameterisation .

aVFire is a predominant factor forcing global terrestrial biomass dynamic , with more than 30 % of the land surface showing frequent burning , particularly in the tropic , where it mostly affect savanna ecosystem annually . Savannas , which cover approximately 269 million ha in South America , play a major role in the global carbon cycle . They are affected by increasing human pressure and global climate change . Using satellite data , this study quantifies vegetation burning in the Colombian Llanos savanna for the period 2000-2008 , and analyzes how fire spatial pattern , frequency and extent vary with ecosystem type , land tenure and rainfall . On average 2.75 +/- 0.5 million ha ( 24 +/- 4.2 % ) of the savanna burn each year . Burned area is highly variable , with 3.4 million ha burned in 2002-2003 and < 1.9 million ha in 2005-2006 . However , during the 2000-2008 period near of 3.7 million ha ( 33.5 % ) of the savanna never burned . Compared with the average 8-10 year of fire return time for the tropic and subtropics , these savanna burn twice a often . In addition , the average burn size figure for tropical and subtropical grassland savanna ( with < 5 % tree ) of 7000 ha ( median 5000 ha ) , is about seven time the average burned patch size we found in our study . Fires predominate in the well-drained high plain savanna , lowest figure occurring along the Andean foothill , in forested area and in pasture and croplands . Annual proportion burned varies with land tenure , being highest in National Parks . This study is the first complete regional map of fire disturbance in a South American savanna . This detailed regional data provides a unique opportunity for increasing the accuracy of global carbon emission calculation .

aVRecent strategy to sustain fish stock have Suggested a move towards an ecosystem based fishery management ( EBFM ) approach . While EBFM considers the effect of fishing at the ecosystem level , it generally struggle with climate-driven environmental variability , In this Study we show that the position of a fish stock within it distributional range or thermal niche ( we use Icelandic and North Sea cod a example of stock at the centre and edge of their niche , respectively ) will influence the relative importance of fishing and climate on abundance . At the warmer edge of the thermal niche of cod in the North Sea , we show a prominent influence of climate oil the cod stock that is mediated through temperature effect on the plankton . In contrast , the influence of climate through it effect on plankton appears much le important at the present centre of the niche around Iceland . Recognising the potentially strong effect . of climate on fish stock , at a time of rapid global climate change , is probably an important prerequisite towards the synthesis of a cod management strategy .

aVRapid carbon input into the ocean-atmosphere system caused a dramatic shoaling of the lysocline during the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum ( PETM ) , a transient ( similar to 170 kyr ) global warming event that occurred roughly 55 Ma . Carbon cycle model invoking an accelerated carbonate-silicate feedback mechanism to neutralize ocean acidification predict that the lysocline would subsequently deepen to depth below it original position a the marine carbonate system recovered from such a perturbation . To test this hypothesis , record of carbonate sedimentation and preservation for PETM section in the Weddell Sea ( ODP Site 690 ) and along the Walvis Ridge depth transect ( ODP Sites 1262 , 1263 , and 1266 ) were assembled within the context of a unified chronostratigraphy . The meridional gradient of undersaturation delimited by these record show that dissolution wa more severe in the subtropical South Atlantic than in the Weddell Sea during the PETM , a spatiotemporal pattern inconsistent with the view that Atlantic overturning circulation underwent a transient reversal . Deepening of the lysocline following it initial ascent is signaled by increase in % CaCO ( 3 ) and coarse-fraction content at all site . Carbonate preservation during the recovery period is appreciably better than that seen prior to carbon input with carbonate sedimentation becoming remarkably uniform over a broad spectrum of geographic and bathymetric setting . These congruent pattern of carbonate sedimentation confirm that the lysocline wa suppressed below the depth it occupied prior to carbon input , and are consistent with the view that an accelerated carbonate-silicate geochemical cycle played an important role in arresting PETM condition .

aVIt is important to study historical temperature time series prior to the industrial revolution so that one can view the current global warming trend from a long-term historical perspective . Because there are no instrumental record of such historical temperature data , climatologist have been interested in reconstructing historical temperature using various proxy time series . In this paper , the author examine a state-space model approach for historical temperature reconstruction which not only make use of the proxy data but also information on external forcings . A challenge in the implementation of this approach is the estimation of the parameter in the state-space model . The author developed two maximum likelihood method for parameter estimation and studied the efficiency and asymptotic property of the associated estimator through a combination of theoretical and numerical investigation .

After the removal of daily and annual periodicity , the primary consideration are trend ( i.e. , global warming ) and long-range correlation . We first carry out Monte Carlo simulation to determine the influence of trend and long-range correlation on record-breaking statistic . We take a time series that is a Gaussian white noise and give the classic record-breaking theory result for an independent and identically distributed process . We then carry out simulation to determine the influence of long-range correlation and linear temperature trend . For the range of fractional Gaussian noise that are observed to be applicable to temperature time series , the influence on the record-breaking statistic is le than 10 % . We next superimpose a linear trend on a Gaussian white noise and extend the theory to include the effect of an additive trend . We determine the ratio of the number of maximum to the number of minimum record-breaking temperature . We find the single governing parameter to be the ratio of the temperature change per year to the standard deviation of the underlying white noise . To test our approach , we consider a 30 yr record of temperature at the Mauna Loa Observatory for 1977-2006 . We determine the temperature trend by direct measurement and use our simulation to infer trend from the number of record-breaking temperature . The two approach give value that are in good agreement . We find that the warming trend is primarily due to an increase in the ( overnight ) minimum temperature , while the maximum ( daytime ) temperature are approximately constant .

aVThe presence of permafrost ha a strong influence on arctic hydrology , ecology , and engineering . Therefore , understanding the response of permafrost to arctic warming is critical to predicting the regional effect of global climate change . Recent research suggests that thaw depth may be increasing in response to warming , but physical thaw depth survey in the Alaskan arctic are often not sensitive enough to detect incremental increase and can not measure increase in the permafrost thaw bulb beneath lake and stream . Here we ass the use of geochemical tracer in stream water to identify change in thaw depth in an arctic watershed . Based on marked difference in geochemistry with depth in soil and permafrost on the Alaskan North Slope , we used ( 87 ) Sr/ ( 86 ) Sr and elemental ratio in an arctic stream a tracer of increase in the maximum depth of soil water flow and therefore the integrated thaw depth in the watershed . From 1994 to 2004 , stream water ( 87 ) Sr/ ( 86 ) Sr , Ca/Na , and Ca/Ba at base flow showed significant trend with time , consistent with increasing depth of soil water flowpaths . Although long time series will be necessary to identify long-term trend , stream geochemistry may be useful a a qualitative indicator of change in thaw depth in other area where permafrost and active layer soil geochemistry differs .

aVThe Colorado River Basin ha been , and continues to be , the focus of a wide diversity of research effort to learn more about the effect of natural and human-induced disturbance on the process and functioning of the basin 's upland watershed . These watershed are situated at the headwater of stream and river that supply much of the water to downstream user in the western United States . Responses of streamflow to vegetation manipulation have been , and are , one of the research focus in this water-deficient part of the country . The watershed-scale research , led by the U.S. Forest Service and it cooperator , ha spanned nearly a century and included an array of vegetation type along a wide range of precipitation gradient . Results from this research have shown that vegetation can be managed to enhance annual water yield while still providing the other natural resource benefit . Analyses of the research result suggest that the effect of vegetation manipulation on streamflow is associated with precipitation-elevational gradient and , therefore , vegetation type . An annual water yield increase between 25 and 100 mm could be achieved by implementing vegetation manipulation in the high elevation subalpine and mixed conifer forest , the ponderosa pine forest ( in the Lower Basin ) , and portion of the low elevation chaparral shrublands . Negligible effect or small increase in water yield were observed for treating sagebrush , pinyon-juniper woodland and desert scrub . Results from this research have improved our understanding of the basin 's hydrology and provided much needed insight to manage forest to mitigate global climate change induced hydrologic impact and meet the increased need of people living in the basin .

aVUnder the background of global warming , doe the effect of the rising global surface temperature accelerate the hydrological cycle ? To address this issue , we use the hydro-climatic data from five sub-basins in Poyang Lake basin in the southeast China over the past 50 year , to investigate the annual and seasonal trend of streamflow and the correlation between streamflow and climatic variable . The Theil-Sen Approach and the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test are applied to identify the trend in the annual and seasonal streamflow , precipitation and evapotranspiration series . It wa found that annual and seasonal streamflow of all the station had increasing trend except Lijiadu station in wet season . Only 37.5 % hydro-stations in annual streamflow increased significantly , while most station increased at 95 % significance level in dry season . Trends in annual and seasonal precipitation during the whole period were generally not a significant a those in evapotranspiration . The correlation between streamflow and climate variable ( precipitation and evapotranspiration ) were detected by the Pearson 's test . The result showed that streamflow in the Poyang Lake basin are more sensitive to change in precipitation than potential evapotranspiration .

aVThe Caribbean region is exposed to hurricane annually and the frequency of occurrence is expected to increase due to global warming . However , a revealed due to hurricane Ivan in 2004 , the current roofing system of the house are particularly vulnerable . In other part of the world ferrocement roofing is a technically and economically viable solution but for acceptance in the Caribbean , the aesthetic factor control the roof design in term of topology prompting a new innovative solution . Load test data is also required by the approving agency of the various jurisdiction in the Caribbean . The result of structural testing of the full-scale main component of a proposed ferrocement roof system are presented . This comprises of a 9.0 m wide and 2.5 m high pitched-portal frame of channel-section with bolted steel connection ; a 6.10 m hollow-section roof slab in bending , and slab-to-frame bolted connection in pullout . It wa found that the performance of the element is consistent with the acknowledged beneficial behavior of ferrocement , and the proposed ferrocement roof system should adequately address the loading condition expected in the Caribbean . The data can also be used to determine safe span of the proposed roof system for application in other region a well . ( C ) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVTo study effect factor on the rapid formation of CO ( 2 ) hydrate , which ha a high capacity for storage of CO ( 2 ) to weaken global warming impact , a specific visual water-spraying gas hydrate formation apparatus wa designed . The gas consumption in the process of hydrate formation ( in the initial pressure range of 2.1-3.5 MPa and initial temperature range of 1.5-3.0 degree C ) wa observed , and the induction time , mole formation rate , and gas storage density within 1 h had been analyzed systematically under different gas supply mode , initial pressure , water volume , and nozzle atomizing angle ; also , the formation heat had been induced . Results showed that the hydrate formation rate , gas storage density , and total formation heat in the reactor were larger in the condition of the oscillating gas supply mode than continuous for the larger mass-transfer driving force caused by pressure disturbance in the former mode or , in a higher initial pressure , with a larger volume of water and nozzle atomizing angle . A larger volume of water in a reasonable range is beneficial for hydrate formation for a relatively larger dissolution quality , and a larger nozzle atomizing angle is also favorable because of higher gas liquid contact probability and larger contact area . Also , with a higher driving force , it can be realized that the morphology of hydrate particle transited from spherical to branching more quickly by the camera online observation of hydrate growth , for larger Gibbs free-energy difference of the phase transition .

aVThe study area , the middle part of Inner Mongolia including Hohhot city , Baotou city , Wulanchabu city , Ordos city , Bayannaoer city and Wuhai city , is one of typical eco-geographical transition zone in China . Using monthly precipitation data ( 1961-2003 ) from 45 meteorological station in the study area , this paper analyzes characteristic and tendency of annual and seasonal rainfall variation , and reveals multi-time scale structure of these time series through wavelet analysis ; also , the period of annual and seasonal precipitation series are identified , and the periodical oscillation and point of abrupt change at the principal period scale are discovered . The result show that annual precipitation varies in a large range , and ha an ascending tendency at an increasing rate of 1.482 mm/10a ; the multi-time scale periodical oscillation are clear ; difference in tendency , range and decadal precipitation anomaly exist within each decade during 1961-2000 . The seasonal allocation of overall annual precipitation is extremely uneven ; in term of tendency of seasonal precipitation , winter and spring have upward trend while summer and autumn have downward tendency ; distinction in tendency , range and decadal precipitation anomaly among each season are in existence within each decade during 1961-2000 . The periodical oscillation of each seasonal precipitation time series are also evident . The research result not only provide convincing evidence for global climate change research , but also facilitate the understanding of specific natural process and pattern to make step to rehabilitate and reconstruct vegetation , and contribute to fulfill the sustainability of water management .

aVUnderstanding how the biomass production and clone growth of perennial grass respond to summer warming is crucial for understanding how grassland productivity responds to global warming . Here , we experimentally investigated the effect of summer warming on the biomass production and clonal growth of potted Leymus chinensis in a phytotron . Summer warming significantly decreased the biomass of both parent and daughter shoot , slightly increased the belowground biomass , and lead to a significant increase in root : shoot ratio . Warming significantly increased the total belowground bud number and decreased the daughter shoot number . Importantly , the proportion of each type of bud changed ; vertical apical rhizome bud decreased , while horizontal rhizome bud increased in number . The change in proportion of each type of bud is closely related to the decrease in daughter shoot number , rhizome number and length , a well a the decrease in aboveground biomass and increase in belowground biomass . These result indicate that , a a rhizomatous , perennial grass , L. chinensis adopts a selective growth strategy that reduces the energy allocated to aboveground growth and emphasis the development of belowground organ . The implication is that continued summer warming , will further reduce the aboveground biomass production of temperate grassland dominated by rhizomatous , perennial grass . Inevitably , specie that depend on these grass for forage will suffer should global climate warming continue .

aVSeasonal and annual trend in surface air temperature over India and 7 homogeneous region ( western Himalaya , northwest , north-central , northeast , east coast , west coast and interior peninsula ) were assessed during 3 period : 1901-2007 , 1971-2007 and 1998-2007 . Indian annual mean ( average of maximum and minimum ) , maximum and minimum temperature showed significant warming trend of 0.51 , 0.72 and 0.27 degree C 100 yr ( -1 ) , respectively , during the period 1901-2007 . However , accelerated warming wa observed in the recent period 1971-2007 , mainly due to intense warming in the recent decade 1998-2007 . Temperatures ( mean , maximum and minimum ) increased by about 0.2 degree C per decade for the period 1971-2007 , with a much steeper increase in minimum temperature than maximum temperature . In the most recent decade , maximum temperature wa significantly higher compared to the long-term ( 1901-2007 ) mean , with a stagnated trend during this period , whereas minimum temperature showed an increasing trend , almost equal to that observed during 1971-2007 . On a seasonal scale , pronounced warming trend in mean temperature were observed in winter and monsoon season , and a significant influence of El Nino Southern Oscillation event on temperature anomaly during certain season across India wa observed . The composite of maximum and minimum temperature of El Nino year showed positive anomaly during monsoon , post-monsoon and subsequent year winter and pre-monsoon season . However , statistically significant positive anomaly were observed only during monsoon and post-monsoon season over large area of the country . The composite temperature anomaly of La Nina year were almost opposite to El Nino composite : the negative temperature anomaly associated with La Nina event persisted from the current monsoon season to the subsequent year pre-monsoon season .

aVDuring the last few decade , Mediterranean epibenthic assemblage have been involved in mass mortality event , in which sea fan were one of the most threatened group . Explants of the most common Mediterranean gorgonian ( Paramuricea clavata , Eunicella cavolinii , E. singularis , and E. verrucosa , 40 explants from each specie ) were transplanted in the field in order to evaluate the response to transplantation , survival and growth rate of the cutting during an annual cycle , from February 2003 to March 2004 . Colonies of each specie overcame transplantation stress and during the first three month they showed a mean survival rate of 98 % and an average positive growth rate of 7.65 % . In the summer season 2003 , during the heatwave that affected the Mediterranean basin , the experimental cutting suffered , showing a mean negative growth rate and a reduction of survival . At the end of the stress event , P. clavata revealed the worst recovery while all Eunicella specie showed a good ability to recover . In particular , E. singularis evidenced the highest resilience among the specie . The transplant method described here could be employed to try to recover sea fan population in the precoralligenous and coralligenous community in possible future project of restocking , where anthropic activity ( anchoring and/or fishing ) and global warming are deeply compromising their survival . Moreover , a species-specific capability to recover wa identified after the stress event concomitant to the increase of the sea temperature .

aVUnderstanding the mechanism by which global climate change and habitat loss impact upon biodiversity is essential in order to mitigate any negative impact . One such impact may be change to population synchrony ( defined a correlated fluctuation in the density of separate population ) . It is well established that synchrony depends on both dispersal ability and correlated environmental condition , for example shared climate . However , what is not clear is whether difference in habitat or position within a specie ' range also mediate synchrony . Since synchronous metapopulations are thought to be more extinction-prone , establishing the driver of synchrony ha clear conservation implication . Using three butterfly specie ( Maniola jurtina , Pyronia tithonus and Aphantopus hyperantus ) we investigated the effect of habitat similarity and range position on population synchrony , after accounting for the effect of distance and climate . Range position wa present in all minimum adequate model , though non-significant using Mantel randomization test in one case . We show that M. jurtina and P. tithonus synchrony is not consistent across specie ' range , with marginal population showing more synchronous dynamic . Increased climatic constraint on marginal population , leading to a narrower range of suitable microhabitats may be responsible for this , which is supported by the result that habitat similarity between site wa also positively correlated with population synchrony . As the landscape becomes increasingly homogeneous , overall population synchrony may be expected to rise . We conclude that habitat modification and climate change have the capacity to drive change in population synchrony that could make specie more vulnerable to extinction .

aVMethane ( CH ( 4 ) ) is an acknowledged greenhouse gas ( GHG ) , and it is playing more and more important role in global warming . So , CH ( 4 ) emission must be controlled in order to restrain the greenhouse effect . However , coalbed methane ( CBM ) emission is an important source of the methane in the atmosphere . Wherefore , it is of significance to study conversion of CBM to methanol for reducing CH ( 4 ) emission into the atmosphere . Technologies of syngas production from CBM , including coupling of CBM deoxygenation and CH ( 4 ) steam rearming , coupling of CH ( 4 ) partial oxidation and CO ( 2 ) rearming , and non-catalytic transforming of CBM , are introduced . The method of making methanol with syngas is also described . Moreover , based on the increase trend of atmospheric methane and the destructive effect of CH ( 4 ) on environment , the environmental benefit on methanol production with CBM is discussed . At the same time , those problem , which should be adverted in the process of synthesizing methanol with CBM , are emphasized

aVThis paper present the result of the LCA of wine production in the region of La Rioja ( Spain ) . The aim of this study wa twofold : to identify the most critical life cycle stage of an aged Spanish wine from the point of view of the associated environmental impact and to compare it environmental performance with that of other wine and beer for which comparable information could be found in the scientific literature . All the product 's life cycle stage were accounted for , namely : grape cultivation ( viticulture ) , wine making and bottling , distribution and sale , and disposal of empty bottle . Foreground data were directly obtained from wine producer , farmer , and oenologist ; background data were instead sourced from the GaBi professional database . In order to limit the uncertainty and subjectivity of the result , the choice wa made to only employ midpoint indicator of environmental impact ( global warming potential ( GWP ) , acidification potential , eutrophication potential , photochemical ozone creation potential ) , in addition to gross energy requirement ( GER ) and water demand ( WD ) . The calculated environmental indicator were allocated to the following co-products on the basis of the associated economic revenue : wine , pomace , lee , and press syrup . The avoided impact associated to electricity generation were accounted for according to the displaced marginal technology . The GWP of Rioja wine wa found to lie between 900 and 1,000 g ( CO ( 2 ) -eq ) /bottle , depending on the assumed distribution scenario . GER is around 8-9 MJ/bottle , and WD is approximately 5 kg/bottle . The most relevant life cycle stage from the point of view of most of the considered impact category were found to be viticulture ( and fertilizer use in particular ) and the production of glass for the bottle . Transportation of the wine and final disposal of the empty bottle cumulatively account for a maximum of 30 % of the overall impact , depending on the specific indicator and the assumed distribution scenario . The analysis appears to be in good agreement with previous literature study , the result of which lie within a comparatively narrow range . Within such range , the more upmarket Rioja wine can arguably be seen a providing a greater net benefit to the economy per unit of impact . The present analysis ha shed light on which are the two main environmental bottleneck in the life cycle of industrialized wine , namely viticulture and glass production for bottle manufacture ; GWP result are in the same range a those from previous literature study . New insight is also provided on a possible measure of `` economic return on environmental investment . '' As it stand , the study presented here is arguably among the most complete and transparent analysis in the alcoholic beverage sector . It could be further enhanced at a later stage by also including those secondary sub-processes which were cut off due to lack of available data ( including herbicide and pesticide ) . As for cross-comparability , it would be recommendable for all author to never omit presenting their result in term of transparent , disaggregated impact indicator .

aVCapture and sequestration of CO ( 2 ) from power plant flue gas have become an important issue in the discussion about global warming . Different concept of capture are being pursued . The advantage of postcombustion process , such a process based on absorption and stripping , is the possibility of retrofitting a state-of-the-art power plant with a capture plant under reasonable effort . Capturing CO ( 2 ) by using an absorption/stripping process requires energy in the form of electricity and steam both supplied by the power plant . The capture process thereby reduces the overall efficiency of the power plant by up to 13 % pt ( percentage point ) . Apart from the development of new solvent , alternative and novel configuration of the process can lower the energy requirement . Three alternative configuration are economically and technically evaluated and compared to a baseline process represented by a standard absorption/stripping process using monoethanolamine ( MEA ) a a solvent . Savings in cost of CO ( 2 ) -avoided of 2-5 % were attained . Regarding the total power required , saving of 4-7 % were obtained . The result showed that not the process with the highest energy saving ha the lowest cost of CO ( 2 ) -avoided , but that the influence of rising in investment cost of more complex configuration can not be ignored . For a comprehensive analysis of different configuration it is essential to perform both an economic evaluation and a technical study .

aVThe temperature sensitivity of the soil organic matter ( SOM ) decomposition along the slope of mountain forest in Austria and Spain wa analyzed . High-altitude forest soil store large quantity of organic carbon ( C ) and are particularly vulnerable to global warming if the decomposition of the SOM is more temperature sensitive than at lower altitude . Mineral soil and O-layer material wa incubated in the laboratory at temperature increasing from 5 degree C to ( 20 degree C ) 25 degree C. The temperature sensitivity ( Q ( 10 ) ) wa determined by fitting different temperature response function to the measured CO ( 2 ) efflux . Bulk soil and density fraction were analyzed for organic C and nitrogen ( N ) content . C and N stock along the elevation gradient were estimated . Q ( 10 ) over the whole incubation temperature range varied between 1.5 and 2.5 but did not show any altitudinal trend for O-layer material and mineral soil along both gradient . Besides that , Q ( 10 ) generally increased with decreasing soil temperature . SOM decomposition at higher elevation forest will be more responsive to global warming because it will be affected in a more sensitive ( cooler ) temperature range compared to lower elevation site . This effect wa modeled by the Lloyd and Taylor function and Gaussian but not by the frequently used exponential temperature function . Both soil C and N content increased with increasing altitude . Density fractionation showed deviating altitudinal C and N pattern of labile and recalcitrant SOM pool along the Spanish gradient . Soil C stock along both gradient did not resemble the trend in C content and were determined by other site-specific factor . This , and significantly low C and N content and stock of a site that wa used a a forest pasture , indicates that both forest management and land use can play equally important role in the development of soil C a climatic factor .

aVSoil respiration , R ( S ) , the flux of microbially and plant-respired carbon dioxide ( CO ( 2 ) ) from the soil surface to the atmosphere , is the second-largest terrestrial carbon flux ( 1-3 ) . However , the dynamic of R ( S ) are not well understood and the global flux remains poorly constrained ( 4,5 ) . Ecosystem warming experiment ( 6,7 ) , modelling analysis ( 8,9 ) and fundamental biokinetics ( 10 ) all suggest that R ( S ) should change with climate . This ha been difficult to confirm observationally because of the high spatial variability of R ( S ) , inaccessibility of the soil medium and the inability of remote-sensing instrument to measure R ( S ) on large scale . Despite these constraint , it may be possible to discern climate-driven change in regional or global R ( S ) value in the extant four-decade record of R ( S ) chamber measurement . Here we construct a database of worldwide R ( S ) observation matched with high-resolution historical climate data and find a previously unknown temporal trend in the R ( S ) record after accounting for mean annual climate , leaf area , nitrogen deposition and change in CO ( 2 ) measurement technique . We find that the air temperature anomaly ( the deviation from the 1961-1990 mean ) is significantly and positively correlated with change in R ( S ) . We estimate that the global R ( S ) in 2008 ( that is , the flux integrated over the Earth 's land surface over 2008 ) wa 98 +/- 12 Pg C and that it increased by 0.1 Pg C yr ( -1 ) between 1989 and 2008 , implying a global R ( S ) response to air temperature ( Q ( 10 ) ) of 1.5 . An increasing global R ( S ) value doe not necessarily constitute a positive feedback to the atmosphere , a it could be driven by higher carbon input to soil rather than by mobilization of stored older carbon . The available data are , however , consistent with an acceleration of the terrestrial carbon cycle in response to global climate change .

aVWhether specie that have persisted throughout historic climatic upheaval will survive contemporary climate change will depend on their ecological and physiological trait , their evolutionary potential , and potentially upon the resource that human commit to prevent their extinction . For those specie where temperature influence sex determination , rapid global warming pose a unique risk of skewed sex ratio and demographic collapse . Here we review the specific mechanism by which reptile with temperature-dependent sex determination ( TSD ) may be imperilled at current rate of warming , and discus the evidence for and against adaptation via behavioural or physiological mean . We propose a scheme for ranking reptile with TSD according to their vulnerability to rapid global warming , but note that critical data on the lability of the sex determining mechanism and on the heritability of behavioural and threshold trait are unavailable for most specie . Nevertheless , we recommend a precautionary approach to management of reptile identified a being at relatively high risk . In such case , management should aim to neutralise directional sex ratio bias ( e.g . by manipulating incubation temperature or assisted migration ) and promote adaptive process , possibly by genetic supplementation of population . These practice should aid specie ' persistence and buy time for research directed at more accurate prediction of specie ' vulnerability . Copyright ( C ) 2010 S. Karger AG , Basel

aVA quantitative palaeobiogeographical study of the late Katian bryozoan provides new insight into the debate on climatic change immediately prior to the Hirnantian glaciation . It focus primarily on the Mediterranean bryozoan , for which new data are now available , and compare their distribution with those from other Gondwanan terranes and the rest of the Late Ordovician palaeocontinents . The analysis show that the bryozoan that invaded the Mediterranean margin of Gondwana , during the late Katian global transgression , were not a simple expansion of the range of those inhabiting the palaeocontinent of Baltica . The immigrant association , although preserving Baltic affinity , developed an independent faunal signal , denoting clear environmental difference from those in the tropical palaeocontinents from which they came . The largest bryozoan biogeographical unit underwent reorganization during the late Katian . They intermixed at low latitude , making it impossible to distinguish between the former Siberian and North-American province , and a new independent Mediterranean Province emerged at mid latitude . The late Katian loss of endemism amongst the bryozoan at tropical latitude is counter to the increasing endemism reported for other tropical fauna in support of the hypothesis of a global warming event However , the extinction of several bryozoan genus in tropical palaeocontinents , simultaneously with their immigration into the Mediterranean cool water , is consistent with the hypothesis of a late Katian global warming : the Boda event The Mediterranean Province bordered the southern half of Gondwana and could have extended from what is now Himalayan India to the Precordilleran terrane of Argentina . A palaeolatitude between 40 and 55 degree south is suggested for the province . ( C ) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All right reserved .

aVA life-cycle assessment ( LCA ) wa carried out to compare the environmental performance of different organic cropping system with and without digestion of slurry and crop residue . The aim of the present study are : ( 1 ) to compare the environmental performance of organic farming dairy system with the currently prevalent animal housing system [ solid farmyard manure ( FYM ) versus liquid slurry ] a the main reference system ; ( 2 ) to analyze the effect of the implementation of a biogas digestion system on the consumption of fossil fuel and production of electrical energy ; ( 3 ) to quantify the effect of the implementation of a biogas digestion system on the environment ; and ( 4 ) to compare the obtained net energy yield with other mean of obtaining energy by using the farmland area . The considered impact category are greenhouse gas ( GHG ) balance , acidification , eutrophication and groundwater pollution . LCA result indicated that total emission in system based on FYM are much higher than in liquid slurry system for most of the considered impact category . The benefit of digestion of stable waste in comparison with the reference system without digestion are mainly ( 1 ) the net reduction of the emission of GHG and ( 2 ) energy recovery from produced biogas , while the disadvantage can be higher emission of NH ( 3 ) after spreading . The effect of additional biogas digestion of biomass such a crop residue ( e. g. , straw of pea and cereal ) and cover crop are : ( 1 ) an optimization of the N-cycle and therewith higher yield ; ( 2 ) higher energy production per unit arable land ; ( 3 ) a further reduction of the GHG balance ; but ( 4 ) higher N-related environmental burden like eutrophication and acidification . The offset of fossil fuel emission were the largest GHG sink in most of the biogas digestion system . The inclusion of a biogas plant into organic cropping system and the use of the available waste for production of energy largely increased the overall productivity of the farming system and matched very well the basic principle of organic farming such a a high self-sufficiency of the cropping system and reducing a much a possible the environmental impact of farming .

aVGlobal warming and greenhouse gas emission are one of the important research in recent year . There are a wide range of greenhouse gas resource and one of them is agricultural activity . During agricultural activity CO ( 2 ) emission from soil occurs . Water requirement in plant production is met by using various irrigation method . The most widely used method are drip irrigation , sprinkler irrigation and surface irrigation . Drip irrigation in recent year ha been preferred due to it le water use . This study wa carried out to determine soil CO ( 2 ) emission in apple orchard of Jersey Mac apple cultivar grafted on M9 which wa irrigated by drip irrigation , sprinkler irrigation and surface irrigation method . In the study , soil CO ( 2 ) flux wa measured after irrigation . CO ( 2 ) flux of drip , sprinkler and surface irrigation wa 0.065 , 0.071 and 0.084 g.CO ( 2 ) .m ( -2 ) .h ( -1 ) , respectively . Evaporation from the soil wa 8.06 , 8.85 and 8.95 g.H ( 2 ) O.m ( -2 ) .h ( -1 ) for drip , sprinkler and surface irrigation , respectively . Even though there were no significant difference among irrigation method in term of CO ( 2 ) flux and evaporation value ( P > 0.05 ) , these result indicated that CO ( 2 ) emission and evaporation value in drip irrigation method tended to decrease .

aVIf the ongoing phenomenon of global warming prevails , three main consequence are expected in tropical sea : a higher sea level , a reduction in coral reef and more intense cyclone . What will shallow-marine carbonate system be like ? Insights can be gained from the Pyrenean Urbasa-Andia Formation , a transgressive heterozoan-like foralgal ( larger foraminiferal and red algal ) ramp that formed in Middle Eocene time , a greenhouse interval characterized by high atmospheric CO ( 2 ) content . Firstly , the evolution of future tropical shallow-marine system subject to a sea-level rise is very likely to be similar to that seen in the backstepping architecture of the Urbasa-Andia Formation . Secondly , Eocene larger foraminifer rose when the Paleocene-Eocene hyperthermal event caused a decline in coral in tropical sea . Coral reef are again among the ecosystem that are likely to be particularly affected by current global warming . It is therefore probable that future shallow-marine tropical ecosystem will be devoid of platform margin coral reef , heterozoan ramp being far more common . Thirdly , strong storm influence wa common on the Urbasa-Andia carbonate ramp , the most distinctive feature being a distal dune field that wa formed below storm wave base by high-energy return current . Similar feature also characterize other Eocene carbonate ramp . Furthermore , numerical simulation highlighted the effect of strong tropical cyclone during the equable climate of the Eocene . Together this information support the hypothesis that tropical cyclone activity may increase under future greenhouse condition . Taking everything into account , the transgressive storm-dominated foralgal ramp represented by the Urbasa-Andia Formation can be used a a virtual analogue of future shallow-marine carbonate sedimentary environment developed under greenhouse condition .

aVA cambarid specimen wa collected in a brook in Saxony ( south-cast Germany ) . Preliminary morphological inspection identified it a the parthenogenetic Marmorkrebs ( Decapoda , Astacida , Cambaridae ) . However , this individual showed some striking morphological difference compared to specimen of our laboratory Marmorkrebs culture . Hence , we conducted a molecular analysis based on two mitochondrion ! gene , COI and 12S , to check it identity . The result of the genetic study verified the initial assumption of a Marmorkrebs identity for the Saxon specimen . Thus , in addition to the two indigenous specie , the new find is the fourth recorded introduced crayfish specie in this area . However , a search for further Marmorkrebs specimen at the same site wa not successful . Most published record of Marmorkrebs in European water concern just single individual and an established population ha so far not been observed . This stand in contrast to other recently introduced cambarid specie . Thus , we critically discus the potential of the Marmorkrebs to spread within Europe . The major obstacle may be that the temperature necessary for optimal development and reproduction of the Marmorkrebs is significantly higher than that found in most European water . However , given globally increasing temperature , this might change in the future .

'' For this review , five flora are selected , in ascending stratigraphic order : the `` Sao Joao do Triunfo , '' `` Figueira . '' `` Quiteria , '' `` Morro do Papaleo '' and `` Irapua Bed '' flora . They are the best-known flora of the basin in term of taxonomic composition , paleoecology and environment of deposition . An early-mid Sakmarian to earliest Artinskian age is indicated for the Rio Bonito Formation based on absolute radiometric and relative biostratigraphic age . Integration of available information about the selected flora allows evaluation of taphonomic and paleoecological factor to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the Early Permian floral record in the Parana Basin . The variation observed in both the taxonomic composition of individual flora and in the frequency of occurrence of different plant group is due to the broad range of environmental/edaphic condition that prevailed in the many different depositional setting represented in the Rio Bonito Formation . A more precise age determination obtained for the plant-bearing deposit permit the establishment of a more confident correlation between the Early Permian floral succession in the Parana Basin and other Early Permian floral succession in other basin . The Sakmarian global warming favored the appearance of pecopterid and sphenopterid fern amongst the spore-producing plant , and the glossopterids amongst the pollen-producing plant .

aVDNA sequence from the ITS region of the nuclear genome and Inter-Simple Sequence Repeat marker ( ISSR ) were used to estimate genetic diversity among and within population of the Frankincense tree Boswellia sacrum from Dhofar , Oman . This is a culturally and ecologically relevant specie that is showing symptom of decline due to anthropic factor and , possibly , global warming . ITS sequence were 511 bp long and showed low ( 6.4 % ) variation among geographically different population . The four selected ISSR primer yielded 93 reproducible band , of which 91 ( 97.9 % ) were polymorphic in the 97 individual profile obtained . Total genetic diversity ( H ( T ) ) and average heterozygosity within population ( H ( S ) ) resulted fairly low ( 0.22 and 0.136 , respectively ) . The accession from Wadi Dowkah , an UNESCO world heritage site , showed the lowest level of genetic diversity ( H ( E ) = 0.107 ) , while the eastern population from the Hasik area harboured a slightly greater amount of variation . Analysis of Molecular Variance showed that differentiation among population wa relatively high ( 38.1 % ) , possibly due to the reduced gene flow between the largely isolated stand of Boswellia ( N ( m ) = 0.39 ) . Genetic distance and AMOVA suggested a clear differentiation between the eastern and western coastal population , while those from the internal area did not form a consistent group . For conservation , the eastern site should be given priority a core population harbouring significant amount of allelic diversity . Reasons for reinforcing the more depauperated stand , such a Wadi Dowkah , with local plant material only or , alternatively , with the introduction of germplasm from genetically distinct stand are discussed .

aVThe increasing atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide ( [ CO ( 2 ) ] ) contributes to global warming and the accompanying shift in climate . However , [ CO ( 2 ) ] itself ha the potential to impact on Australia 's terrestrial biodiversity , due to it importance in the photosynthetic process , which underlies all terrestrial food web . Here , we review our knowledge regarding the impact of elevated [ CO ( 2 ) ] on native terrestrial specie and ecosystem , and suggest key area in which we have little information on this topic . Experimental information exists for 70 ( or le than 0.05 % ) of Australia 's native terrestrial plant and animal specie . Of these , 68 are vascular plant . The growth of Australian woody specie is more reliably increased by elevated [ CO ( 2 ) ] than it is in grass . At the specie level , the most overwhelming response to increased [ CO ( 2 ) ] are a reduction in plant nitrogen concentration and an increase in the production of secondary metabolite . This is of particular concern for Australia 's unique herbivorous and granivorous marsupial , for which no information is available . While many plant specie also displayed increased growth rate at higher [ CO ( 2 ) ] , this wa far from universal , indicating that change in community structure and function are likely , leading to alteration of habitat quality . Future research should be directed to key knowledge gap including the relationship between [ CO ( 2 ) ] , fire frequency and fire tolerance and the impact of increasing [ CO ( 2 ) ] for Australia 's iconic browsing mammal . We also know virtually nothing of the impact of the increasing [ CO ( 2 ) ] on Australia 's unique shrublands and semi-arid/arid rangeland . In conclusion , there is sufficient information available to be certain that the increasing [ CO ( 2 ) ] will affect Australia 's native biodiversity . However , the information required to formulate prediction concerning the long-term future of almost all organism is far in excess of that currently available .

aVWe studied contrasting glacier system in continental ( Orulgan , Suntar-Khayata and Chersky ) mountain range , located in the region of the lowest temperature in the Northern Hemisphere at the boundary of Atlantic and Pacific influence - and maritime one ( Kamchatka Peninsula ) - under Pacific influence . Our purpose is to present a simple projection method to ass the main parameter of these glacier region under climate change . To achieve this , constructed vertical profile of mass balance ( accumulation and ablation ) based both on meteorological data for the 1950-1990s ( baseline period ) and ECHAM4 for 2049-2060 ( projected period ) are used , the latter - a a climatic scenario . The observation and scenario were used to define the recent and future equilibrium line altitude and glacier terminus altitude level for each glacier system a well a area and balance component . The altitudinal distribution of ice area were determined for present and future , and they were used for prediction of glacier extent versus altitude in the system taking into account the correlation between the ELA and glacier-terminus level change . We tested two hypothesis of ice distribution versus altitude in mountain ( valley ) glacier - `` linear '' and `` non-linear '' . The result are estimate of the possible change of the area and morphological structure of northeastern Asia glacier system and their mass balance characteristic for 2049-2060 . Glaciers in the southern part of northeastern Siberia and those covering small range in Kamchatka will likely disappear under the ECHAM4 scenario ; the best preservation of glacier will be on the highest volcanic peak of Kamchatka . Finally , we compare characteristic of the stability of continental and maritime glacier system under global warming .

aVThe sensitivity of the midlatitude storm track and eddy-driven wind to the sea surface temperature ( SST ) boundary forcing is studied over a wide range of perturbation using both simple and comprehensive general circulation model over aquaplanet lower boundary condition . Under the single-jet circulation regime similar to the condition of the present climate in the Northern Hemisphere winter or the Southern Hemisphere summer , the eddy-driven jet shift monotonically poleward with both the global mean and the equator-to-pole gradient of the SST . The eddy-driven jet can have a reverse relationship to the gradient if it is well separated from the subtropical jet and Hadley cell boundary in a double-jet circulation regime . A simple scaling is put forward to interpret the simulated sensitivity of the storm-track/eddy-driven westerly wind position within the single-jet regime in both model . The rationale for the scaling is based on the notion that the wave activity flux can propagate horizontally away from the source region , resulting in a broader distribution of eddy potential vorticity ( PV ) flux in the upper troposphere than that of the flux in the opposite direction in the lower troposphere . As a consequence , the position of the maximum of the eddy-driven westerly tends to be controlled by the profile of the relatively sharp-peaked low-level PV flux , which is dominated by the eddy heat flux component of the Eliassen-Palm ( EP ) flux . Thus , the position of the eddy-driven surface westerly may be inferred from the vertical EP flux coming out of the lower troposphere . The vertical EP flux can be parameterized by a measure of baroclinicity , whose latitudinal variation show a linear relationship with the meridional displacement of the eddy-driven westerly and the storm track . This relationship still hold well within the single-jet regime , even when only the variation of static stability is taken into consideration in estimating the baroclinicity ( the temperature gradient component of which is fixed ) . To the extent that the static stability is deterministically constrained by and hence can be predicted from the given SST condition through a moist scaling for the midlatitude stratification , one may , given SST perturbation , predict which way the storm track and eddy-driven wind should shift with respect to a chosen reference climate state . The resultant anomaly-wise scaling turn out to be valid for both the idealized and comprehensive model , regardless of the detail in the model physic . By corollary , it can be argued that the poleward shift of storm track found in the global warming simulation by fully coupled climate model may be attributed , at least partially , to the increase in the subtropical and midlatitude static stability with global warming .

aVWe describe numerical simulation designed to elucidate the role of mean ocean salinity in climate . Using a coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model , we study a 100-year sensitivity experiment in which the global-mean salinity is approximately doubled from it present observed value , by adding 35 psu everywhere in the ocean . The Salinity increase produce a rapid global-mean seasurface warming of 0.8 degree C within a few year , caused by reduced vertical mixing associated with change in cabbeling . The warming is followed by a gradual global-mean sea-surface cooling of 0.4 degree C within a few decade , caused by an increase in the vertical ( downward ) component of the isopycnal diffusive heat flux . We find no evidence of impact on the variability of the thermohaline circulation ( THC ) or El Nino/Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) . The mean strength of the Atlantic meridional overturning is reduced by 20 % and the North Atlantic Deep Water penetrates le deeply . Nevertheless , our result dispute claim that higher salinity for the world ocean have profound consequence for the thermohaline circulation . In additional experiment with doubled atmospheric carbon dioxide , we find that the amplitude and spatial pattern of the global warming signal are modified in the hypersaline ocean . In particular , the equilibrated global-mean sea-surface temperature increase caused by doubling carbon dioxide is reduced by 10 % . We infer the existence ofa non-linear interaction between the climate response to modified carbon dioxide and modified salinity . ( C ) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All right reserved .

aVKnowledge of factor that are important in reef resilience help u understand how reef react following major environmental disturbance such a hurricane and bleaching . Here we test factor that might have influenced Jamaican reef resilience to , and subsequent recovery from , the 2005 bleaching event , and which might help inform management policy for reef in the future : reef rugosity and contact of coral with macroalgae . In addition , we test in the field , on Dairy Bull reef , whether aggregated Porites astreoides colony exhibit enhanced growth when exposed to superior competition from Acopora palmata , a ha been found by experiment with the Indo-Pacific coral Porites lobata and the superior competitor Porites ru [ Idjadi , J.A. , Karlson , R.H. , 2007 . Spatial arrangement of competitor influence coexistence of reef-building coral . Ecology 88 , 2449-2454 ] . There were significant linear relationship between rugosity and the increase in smallest size class for Sidastrea siderea , Colpophyllia notans , P. astreoides and Agaricia specie , and between rugosity and cover of the branching coral Acropora cervicornis . Linear extension rate of A. cervicornis and radial growth rate of A astreoides were significantly lower ( p 6 ) when in contact with macroalgae . Aggregated colony of P. astreoides in contact with one another , one of which wa in contact with the faster growing competitor A. palmata showed significantly greater growth rate than with just two aggregated P. astreoides colony alone . These finding suggest that three dimensional topography and complexity is important for reef resilience and viability in the face of environmental stressor such a bleaching . Our finding also support the idea that aggregated spatial arrangement of coral can influence the outcome of interspecific competition and promote specie coexistence , important in time of reef recovery after disturbance .

aVEvolutionary community ecology is an emerging field of study that includes evolutionary principle such a individual trait variation and plasticity of trait to provide a more mechanistic insight a to how specie diversity is maintained and community process are shaped across time and space . In this review we explore phenotypic plasticity in functional trait and it consequence at the community level . We argue that resource requirement and resource uptake are plastic trait that can alter fundamental and realised niche of specie in the community if environmental condition change . We conceptually add to niche model by including phenotypic plasticity in trait involved in resource allocation under stress . Two qualitative prediction that we derive are : ( 1 ) plasticity in resource requirement induced by availability of resource enlarges the fundamental niche of specie and cause a reduction of vacant niche for other specie and ( 2 ) plasticity in the proportional resource uptake result in expansion of the realized niche , causing a reduction in the possibility for coexistence with other specie . We illustrate these prediction with data on the competitive impact of invasive specie . Furthermore , we review the quickly increasing number of empirical study on evolutionary community ecology and demonstrate the impact of phenotypic plasticity on community composition . Among others , we give example that show that difference in the level of phenotypic plasticity can disrupt specie interaction when environmental condition change , due to effect on realized niche . Finally , we indicate several promising direction for future phenotypic plasticity research in a community context . We need an integrative , trait-based approach that ha it root in community and evolutionary ecology in order to face fast changing environmental condition such a global warming and urbanization that pose ecological a well a evolutionary challenge .

aVMany primate specie are severely threatened , but little is known about the effect of global warming and the associated intensification of El Nino event on primate population . Here , we document the influence of the El Nino southern oscillation ( ENSO ) and hemispheric climatic variability on the population dynamic of four genus of ateline ( neotropical , large-bodied ) primate . All ateline genus experienced either an immediate or a lagged negative effect of El Nino event . ENSO event were also found to influence primate resource level through neotropical arboreal phenology . Furthermore , frugivorous primate showed a high degree of interspecific population synchrony over large scale across Central and South America attributable to the recent trend in large-scale climate . These result highlight the role of large-scale climatic variation and trend in ateline primate population dynamic , and emphasize that global warming could pose additional threat to the persistence of multiple specie of endangered primate .

aVEuropean coastal water have in recent year become more turbid a algal growth ha increased , probably due to eutrophication , global warming and change in fish community . Turbidity reduces visibility , and such change may in turn affect animal behaviour a well a evolutionary process that are dependent on visual stimulus . In this study we experimentally manipulated water visibility and olfactory cue to investigate mate choice using the sex role-reversed broad-nosed pipefish Syngnathus typhle a our study organism . We show that male spent significantly longer time assessing female when they had access to full visual cue , compared to when visibility wa reduced . Presence or absence of olfactory cue from female did not affect mate choice , suggesting that the possible use of smell could not make up for a reduction in visibility . This implies that mate choice is environmentally dependent and that an increased turbidity may affect process of sexual selection through an impaired possibility for visually based mate choice .

aVMilankovitch Theory show that glacial-interglacial cycle in the Quaternary are related to the variation of solar insolation forcing linked to the earth 's astronomical parameter . However , the summer insolation at northern high latitude , usually considered a the main external forcing for the ice age a Milankovitch pointed out , is marked by the 19- and 23-ka precession periodicity , which is not consistent with the glacial-interglacial cycle . On the other hand , recent study indicate that the annual mean insolation dominated by the obliquity is also an important external forcing in glacial cycle . In this paper , it is assumed that the glacial oscillation Is regulated simultaneously by the annual mean insolation at northern high latitude related to obliquity and the noon insolation at summer solstice at the ice-line latitude related to precession . Only when both of them exceed some threshold , doe the ice sheet start to melt continuously to induce the global warming and deglaciation . Furthermore , the periodicity transition of glacial cycle at mid-Pleistocene wa a natural change when the ice sheet thickness altered . A conceptual model based on this idea give encouraging result compared with the isotopic data .

aVWe present a comprehensive evaluation of uncertainty in the Global Warming Potential ( GWP ) and Global Temperature Change Potential ( GTP ) of CH ( 4 ) , using a simple climate model calibrated to AOGCMs and coupled climate-carbon cycle model assessed in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report ( AR4 ) . In addition , we estimate uncertainty in these metric probabilistically by using a method that doe not rely on AOGCMs but instead build on historical constraint and uncertainty estimate of current radiative forcings . While our mean and median GWPs and GTPs estimate are consistent with previous study , our analysis suggests that uncertainty range for GWPs are almost twice a large a estimated in the AR4 . Relative uncertainty for GTPs are larger than for GWPs , nearly twice a high for a time horizon of 100 year . Given this uncertainty , our result imply the possibility for substantial future adjustment in best-estimate value of GWPs and in particular GTPs . Citation : Reisinger , A. , M. Meinshausen , M.

aVThe increase of green house gas ( GHG ) concentration in the atmosphere is predominantly caused by the anthropogenic activity of fossil fuel burning and land use change . The flux of GHGs from soil and ecosystem to the atmosphere is large , and any error in estimating these flux have a significant impact oil our quantification of the relative importance of land use in contributing to global warming . Numerical model have been developed to estimate the net flux of the biogenic GHGs : CO ( 2 ) , N ( 2 ) O and CH ( 4 ) , for various agricultural management practice . These model have been developed using data from many different experimental site around the world , encompassing different crop , farm management system , soil and climatic condition . Crop experiment and GHG flux measurement are expensive and last several year if not decade so these model are Often used to test hypothesis about the effect of future condition , land use scenario and also to predict the effect of novel land management scenario to reduce emission . However , uncertainty in the input Soil parameter and meteorological data that drive these model propagates through them , resulting in uncertainty in the prediction of biogenic GHG emission . This paper describes an experiment that investigates how well the commonly used de-nitrification decomposition ( DNDC ) soil model performs when used to predict the eddy-covariance CO ( 2 ) flux and crop yield measured in the first full year of the Oensingen cropland site in Switzerland . DNDC N ( 2 ) O prediction are compared to the IPCC emission factor for arable land . This study includes an estimation of the uncertainty of soil input parameter , a sensitivity Study a to their effect on predicted GHG emission and the propagation of their uncertainty through the model . This study considers uncertainty in meteorological measurement and the impact of using Subsets of this data in the model . In particular the effect of using monthly meteorological parameter to generate daily time series for input into the model is investigated and the error propagation quantified . The overall impact of uncertainty in input parameter on predicted biogenic GHG emission is relatively small with the PDF of the uncertainty indicating that the NEE is over estimated by 3.6 % and ha a SD of 3.6 % of the actual NEE . Nitrous oxide emission are not biased but have a larger SD of 23 % of emission , which when the global warming impact is considered is only 3 % of net flux . DNDC can therefore be used with confidence to predict emission . with the caveat that the biomass production need to be match to local condition . ( C ) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All right reserved .

aVWe reconstructed decadal to centennial variability of maximum sea ice extent in the Western Nordic Seas for A.D. 1200-1997 using a combination of a regional tree-ring chronology from the timberline area in Fennoscandia and delta ( 18 ) O from the Lomonosovfonna ice core in Svalbard . The reconstruction successfully explained 59 % of the variance in sea ice extent based on the calibration period 1864-1997 . The significance of the reconstruction statistic ( reduction of error , coefficient of efficiency ) is computed for the first time against a realistic noise background . The twentieth century sustained the lowest sea ice extent value since A.D. 1200 : low sea ice extent also occurred before ( mid-seventeenth and mid-eighteenth century , early fifteenth and late thirteenth century ) , but these period were in no case a persistent a in the twentieth century . Largest sea ice extent value occurred from the seventeenth to the nineteenth century , during the Little Ice Age ( LIA ) , with relatively smaller sea ice-covered area during the sixteenth century . Moderate sea ice extent occurred during thirteenth-fifteenth century . Reconstructed sea ice extent variability is dominated by decadal oscillation , frequently associated with decadal component of the North Atlantic Oscillation/Arctic Oscillation ( NAO/AO ) , and multi-decadal lower frequency oscillation operating at similar to 50-120 year . Sea ice extent and NAO showed a non-stationary relationship during the observational period . The present low sea ice extent is unique over the last 800 year , and result from a decline started in late-nineteenth century after the LIA .

aVWhile many of the previous positive Indian Ocean dipole ( IOD ) year were associated with above ( below ) normal monsoon rainfall over central ( southern ) India during summer monsoon month [ June-September ( JJAS ) ] , the IOD event in 2008 is associated with below ( above ) -normal rainfall in many part of central ( southern peninsular ) India . Because understanding such regional organization is a key for success in regional prediction , using different datasets and atmospheric model simulation , the reason for this abnormal behavior of the monsoon in 2008 are explored . Compared to normal positive IOD event , sea surface temperature ( SST ) and rainfall in the southern tropical Indian Ocean ( STIO ) in JJAS 2008 were abnormally high . Downwelling Rossby wave and oceanic heat advection played an important role in warming SST abnormally in the STIO . It wa also found that the combined influence of a linear warming trend in the tropical Indian Ocean and warming associated with the IOD have resulted in abnormal warming of the STIO . This abnormal SST warming resulted in enhancement of convection in the southwest tropical Indian Ocean and forced anticyclonic circulation anomaly over the Bay of Bengal and central India , leading to suppressed rainfall over this region in JJAS 2008 . The above mechanism is tested by conducting several model sensitivity experiment with an atmospheric general circulation model ( AGCM ) . These experiment confirmed that the subsidence over central India and the Bay of Bengal wa forced mainly by the anomalous warming in the STIO region driven by coupled ocean-atmosphere process . This study provides the first evidence of combined Indian Ocean warming , associated with global warming , and IOD-related warming influence on Indian summer monsoon rainfall . The combined influence may force below-normal rainfall over central India by inducing strong convection in the STIO region . The conventional seesaw in convection between the Indian subcontinent and the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean may shift to the central equatorial Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal if the central Indian Ocean consistently warms in the global warming scenario .

aVGlowa-Danube ( http : //www.glowa-danube.de ) is an interdisciplinary project that aim to develop integrated strategy and tool for water and land use management in the upper Danube catchment ( Germany , Austria similar to 77,000 km ( 2 ) ) . The project is one of five within the Glowa research program ( http : //www.glowa.org ) dealing with Global Change effect on the water cycle in six meso-scale catchment ( up to 100,000 km ( 2 ) ) in Central Europe , West Africa and the Middle East . In the Glowa-Danube project , 16 natural science and socio-economic simulation model are integrated in the coupled simulation system Danubia . This article describes the underlying concept and implementation of WaterSupply , a multiactor-based model of the water supply sector with a focus on water resource utilization and distribution of individual water supply company . Within Danubia , WaterSupply represents the link between water supply and demand , where the former is simulated by a groundwater and a surface water model and the latter by water consumption model of four different sector ( domestic , industrial , agricultural and tourism ) . WaterSupply interprets the quantitative state of water resource for defined spatial and temporal unit according to sustainability requirement and ass the state of resource in relation to present water supply scheme and the dynamic of user demand . WaterSupply then seek both to optimize the resource use of supply company and to identify critical region for which further adaptation of the water supply scheme will become necessary under changing climatic condition . In this article , a brief description of the Glowa-Danube project and the integrated simulation system Danubia is followed by a short presentation of the DeepActor framework , which provides a common conceptual and technical basis for the socio-economic simulation model of Glowa-Danube . The main body of the article is devoted to the concept , the implementation and simulation result of WaterSupply . Results from different scenario calculation demonstrate the capability and the potential field of application of the model .

aVTemperate forest have recently been identified a being continuing sink for carbon even in their mature and senescent stage . However , modeling exercise indicate that a warmer and drier climate a predicted for part of Central Europe may substantially alter the source/sink function of these economically important ecosystem . In a transect study with 14 mature European beech ( Fagus sylvatica L. ) forest growing on uniform geological substrate , we analyzed the influence of a large reduction of annual precipitation ( 970-520 mm yr-1 ) on the carbon stock in fast and slow pool , independent of the well-known aging effect . We investigated the C storage in the organic L , F , H layer , the mineral soil to 100 cm , and in the biomass ( stem , leaf , fine root ) , and analyzed the dependence of these pool on precipitation . Soil organic carbon decreased by about 25 % from stand with > 900 mm yr-1 to those with < 600 mm yr-1 ; while the carbon storage in beech stem slightly increased . Reduced precipitation affected the biomass C pool in particular in the fine root fraction but much le in the leaf biomass and stem fraction . Fine root turnover increased with a precipitation reduction , even though stand fine root biomass and SOC in the organic L , F , and H layer decreased . According to regression analysis , the C storage in the organic layer wa mainly controlled by the size of the fine root C pool suggesting an important role of fine root turnover for the C transfer from tree biomass to the SOC pool . We conclude that the long-term consequence of a substantial precipitation decrease would be a reduction of the mineral soil and organic layer SOC pool , mainly due to higher decomposition rate . This could turn temperate beech forest into significant carbon source instead of sink under global warming .

aVThe carbon cycle modulates climate change , via the regulation of atmospheric CO ( 2 ) , and it represents one of the most important service provided by ecosystem . However , considerable uncertainty remain concerning potential feedback between the biota and the climate . In particular , it is unclear how global warming will affect the metabolic balance between the photosynthetic fixation and respiratory release of CO ( 2 ) at the ecosystem scale . Here , we present a combination of experimental field data from freshwater mesocosms , and theoretical prediction derived from the metabolic theory of ecology to investigate whether warming will alter the capacity of ecosystem to absorb CO ( 2 ) . Our manipulative experiment simulated the temperature increase predicted for the end of the century and revealed that ecosystem respiration increased at a faster rate than primary production , reducing carbon sequestration by 13 per cent . These result confirmed our theoretical prediction based on the differential activation energy of these two process . Using only the activation energy for whole ecosystem photosynthesis and respiration we provide a theoretical prediction that accurately quantified the precise magnitude of the reduction in carbon sequestration observed experimentally . We suggest the combination of whole-ecosystem manipulative experiment and ecological theory is one of the most promising and fruitful research area to predict the impact of climate change on key ecosystem service .

aVIn deep temperate lake , the beginning of the growing season is triggered by thermal stratification , which alleviates light limitation of planktonic producer in the surface layer and prevents heat loss to deeper stratum . The sequence of subsequent phenological event ( phytoplankton spring bloom , grazer peak , clearwater phase ) result in part from coupled phytoplankton-grazer interaction . Disentangling the separate , direct effect of correlated climatic driver ( stratification-dependent underwater light climate vs. water temperature ) from their indirect effect mediated through trophic feedback is impossible using observational field data , which challenge our understanding of global warming effect on seasonal plankton dynamic . We therefore manipulated water temperature and stratification depth independently in experimental field mesocosms containing ambient microplankton and inoculum of the resident grazer Daphnia hyalina . Higher light availability in shallower surface layer accelerated primary production , warming accelerated consumption and growth of Daphnia , and both factor speeded up successional dynamic driven by trophic feedback . Specifically , phytoplankton peaked and decreased earlier and Daphnia population increased and peaked earlier at both shallower stratification and higher temperature . The timing of ciliate dynamic wa unrelated to both factor . Volumetric peak density of phytoplankton , ciliate and Daphnia in the surface layer were also unaffected by temperature but declined with stratification depth in parallel with light availability . The latter relationship vanished , however , when population size were integrated over the entire water column . Overall our result suggest that , integrated over the entire water column of a deep lake , surface warming and shallower stratification independently speed up spring successional event , whereas the magnitude of phytoplankton and zooplankton spring peak are le sensitive to these factor . Therefore , accelerated dynamic under warming need not lead to a trophic mismatch ( given similar grazer inoculum at the time of stratification ) . We emphasize that entire water column dynamic must be studied to estimate global warming effect on lake ecosystem .

aVThe need of reducing CO ( 2 ) emission in electricity generation field for solving global warming problem ha led to increase interest in Micro-Grid ( MG ) especially the one with renewable source such a solar and wind generation . Wind speed fluctuation cause high fluctuation in output power of wind turbine which cause fluctuation in fr and voltage of the MG in the islanding mode and originate stability problem . In this study , a new fuzzy logic pitch controller and an energy storage ultra capacitor are proposed and developed to smooth the output power of wind turbine and enhance MG 's performance in islanding mode . These two proposed controller are compared with the conventional PI pitch controller , which is usually used to control wind generation system when the wind speed exceeds a rated value . Obtained result proved that our two proposed strategy are effective for the MG performance improvement during islanding mode . All model and controller are developed using Matlab ( R ) Simulink ( R ) environment . ( C ) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVIn this paper , change in isentropic circulation associated with global warming in the A1B model output for the 20th and 21st century are analyzed . The change in the circulation on dry and moist isentropes are quantified through the use of three bulk measure of the circulation : mass transport , entropy transport and effective stratification . The circulation on dry isentropes is expected to weaken due to a reduction of the meridional heat transport and to an increase in stratification . In contrast , the moist branch of the circulation , measured in term of the difference between the circulation on moist and dry isentropes , strengthens during the winter month . This intensification is characterized not only by an increase in the eddy latent heat transport but also by an increase in the mass transport . This indicate a larger poleward mass flow of warm moist subtropical air into the stormtracks leading to enhanced moist ascent within baroclinic eddy . Citation : Laliberte , F. , and O.

aVHydrogen-based energy system could address issue related to global climate change , energy security , and local air pollution . Thermally and hydrothermally stable microporous membrane with intrinsic high H ( 2 ) /CO ( 2 ) selectivity are highly demanded . A novel zeolitic imidazolate framework ( ZIF-7 ) membrane wa tested for it gas separation performance . ZIFs are microporous material and belong to the new class of metal-organic framework ( MOFs ) . ZIF-7 is formed by bridging benzimidazolate anion and zinc cation resulting in a sodalite ( SOD ) topology with a pore size of about 0.3 nm . The ZIF-7 membrane exhibited promising H ( 2 ) separation ability . At 220 degree C , the H ( 2 ) permeance is similar to 4.5 x 10 ( -8 ) mol m ( -2 ) s ( -1 ) Pa ( -1 ) and the mixture separation factor for H ( 2 ) /CO ( 2 ) , H ( 2 ) /N ( 2 ) , and H ( 2 ) /CH ( 4 ) are 13.6 , 18.0 , and 14.0 , respectively . As a result of molecular sieving mechanism , the ideal selectivity and mixture separation factor are identical . The permeation of H ( 2 ) through the ZIF-7 membrane is highly activated with an apparent activation energy of 11.9 kJ mol ( -1 ) . Due to the ultra-hydrophobic property of ZIF material , the ZIF-7 membrane also showed excellent hydrothermal stability in the presence of steam . Our result clearly demonstrate that ZIF-7 membrane have an intrinsic high H ( 2 ) /CO ( 2 ) selectivity and a promising application in hydrogen separation , which is based on it very narrow and well-defined crystal pore structure .

aVSpecies composition and parameter of biomass of net plankton were analyzed for four large and 35 small lake from 10 area located between 69.5A degree and 67.5A degree N and 87A degree and 92A degree E that were examined in July-August , 2001 and 2003-2004 . In the composition of the first ( dominant ) and/or second ( subdominant ) specie in the ranged row of the average biomass , the lake were copepod in 78.8 % of case , in 67.3 % , calanoid . The share of biomass of cladocerans in the total biomass of zooplankton exceeded 50 % only in 31 % of case . By the frequency of occurrence a dominant or subdominant by biomass the first place is occupied by copepodites calanoid ( 34.6 % of case ) , the second , by sexually mature Heterocope appendiculata ( 26.9 % ) , the third , by copepodites cyclopoid ( 17.3 % ) , the fourth , by Polyphemus pediculus ( 15.4 % ) , the fifth , by Acanthodiaptomus denticornis ( 13.5 % ) , the sixth , by Bosmina cf . longispina ( 11.5 % ) , the seventh , by Heterocope borealis ( 9.6 % ) , the eighth , by Daphnia cf . longispina ( 7.7 % of case ) . For the first time in the region 14 specie of crustacean zooplankton are given . The known range of some specie and subspecies ( for example , Chydorus biovatus , Camptocercus fennicus , Ophyoxus gracilis kolymensis , Arctodiaptomus acutilobatus , Acanthrodiaptomus tibetanus ) is widened owing to the finding in the studied region . The group of the area are more similar in term of zooplankton north to south than east to west ; the number of the cladoceran specie and the number of cladoceran lake grew north to south and east to west , which corresponded to the general change of climate towards more mild north to south for similar altitude and east to west for different altitude from mountain area to the low land . The comparison of the specie list from different northern region showed that the specie diversity ( total number of specie ) of cladocerans and copepod doe not change significantly west to east . Distribution of specie and change in the zooplankton structure are discussed from the point of view of possible influence of the global warming .

aVTo compare difference among the Medieval Warm Period ( MWP ) , Little Ice Age ( LIA ) , and 20th century global warming ( 20CW ) , six set of transient and equilibrium simulation were generated using the climate system model FGOALS_gl . This model wa developed by the State Key Laboratory of Numerical Modeling for Atmospheric Sciences and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics , Institute of Atmospheric Physics , Chinese Academy of Sciences . The result indicate that MWP warming is evident on a global scale , except for at mid-latitudes of the North Pacific . However , the magnitude of the warming is weaker than that in the 20th century . The warming in the high latitude of the Northern Hemisphere is stronger than that in the Southern Hemisphere . The LIA cooling is also evident on a global scale , with a strong cooling over the high Eurasian continent , while the cooling center is over the Arctic domain . Both the MWP and the 20CW experiment exhibit the strongest warming anomaly in the middle troposphere around 200-300 hPa , but the cooling center of the LIA experiment is seen in the polar surface of the Northern Hemisphere . A comparison of model simulation against the reconstruction indicates that model 's performance in simulating the surface air temperature change during the warm period is better than that during the cold period . The consistency between model and reconstruction in lower latitude are better than those in high latitude . Comparison of the inter-annual variability mode of East Asian summer monsoon ( EASM ) rainfall during the MWP , LIA and 20CW reveals a similar rainfall anomaly pattern . However , the time spectrum of the principal component during the three typical period of the last millennium are different , and the quasi-biannual oscillation is more evident during the two warm period . At a centennial time scale , the external mode of the EASM variability driven by the change of effective solar radiation is determined by the change of large scale land-sea thermal contrast . The rainfall anomaly over the east of 110 E exhibit a meridional homogeneous change pattern , which is different from the meridional out-of-phase change of rainfall anomaly associated with the internal mode .

aVEnergy consumption in the Chinese residential sector is increasing quickly . In this study , we developed a Micro-model to forecast residential CO ( 2 ) emission . The model output support decision making for appropriate CO ( 2 ) emission reduction goal . First , for Chinese urban residential building , we developed a CO ( 2 ) emission forecast model for 2050 taking into account lifestyle change and Global Warming countermeasure . Second , we used the model to estimate the CO ( 2 ) reduction potential of both residential and electrical countermeasure . Compared to the business a usual ( BaU ) scenario , implementation of residential countermeasure achieved 38 % , 24 % and 23 % emission reduction for Beijing , Shanghai and Hong Kong respectively . After combining them with the implementation of electrical countermeasure the reduction rate rose to 60 % . We also compared the countermeasure to see which could bring the greatest emission reduction . For Beijing , improvement of insulation wa most efficient . For Shanghai and Hong Kong , COP increase of hot water supply appears to be the most efficient countermeasure . Through this study we were able to model global warming countermeasure for the Chinese residential sector , and found that reducing CO ( 2 ) emission by 60 % from BaU is an achievable goal .

aVAlthough developing country are called to participate in CO2 emission reduction effort to avoid dangerous climate change , the implication of proposed reduction scheme in human development standard of developing country remain a matter of debate . We show the existence of a positive and time-dependent correlation between the Human Development Index ( HDI ) and per caput CO2 emission from fossil fuel combustion . Employing this empirical relation , extrapolating the HDI , and using three population scenario , the cumulative CO2 emission necessary for developing country to achieve particular HDI threshold are assessed following a Development As Usual approach ( DAU ) . If current demographic and development trend are maintained , we estimate that by 2050 around 85 % of the world 's population will live in country with high HDI ( above 0.8 ) . In particular , 300 Gt of cumulative CO2 emission between 2000 and 2050 are estimated to be necessary for the development of 104 developing country in the year 2000 . This value represents between 20 % to 30 % of previously calculated CO2 budget limiting global warming to 2 degree C. These constraint and result are incorporated into a CO2 reduction framework involving four domain of climate action for individual country . The framework reserve a fair emission path for developing country to proceed with their development by indexing country-dependent reduction rate proportional to the HDI in order to preserve the 2 degree C target after a particular development threshold is reached . For example , in each time step of five year , country with an HDI of 0.85 would need to reduce their per caput emission by approx . 17 % and country with an HDI of 0.9 by 33 % . Under this approach , global cumulative emission by 2050 are estimated to range from 850 up to 1100 Gt of CO2 . These value are within the uncertainty range of emission to limit global temperature to 2 degree C .

aVA series of transient global warming event ( 1,2 ) occurred during the late Palaeocene and early Eocene , about 59 to 50 million year ago . The event , although variable in magnitude , were apparently paced by orbital cycle ( 2-4 ) and linked to massive perturbation of the global carbon cycle ( 5,6 ) . However , a causal link between orbital change in insolation and the carbon cycle ha yet to be established for this time period . Here we present a series of coupled climate model simulation that demonstrate that orbitally induced change in ocean circulation and intermediate water temperature can trigger the destabilization of methane hydrate . We then use a simple threshold model to show that progressive global warming over million of year , in combination with the increasing tendency of the ocean to remain in a more stagnant state , can explain the decreasing magnitude and increasing frequency of hyperthermal event throughout the early Eocene . Our work show that nonlinear interaction between climate and the carbon cycle can modulate the effect of orbital variation , in this case producing transient global warming event with varying timing and magnitude .

aVGlobal total column water vapor trend have been derived from both the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment ( GOME ) and the Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography ( SCIAMACHY ) satellite data and from globally distributed radiosonde measurement , archived and quality controlled by the Deutscher Wetterdienst ( DWD ) . The control of atmospheric water vapor amount by the hydrological cycle play an important role in determining surface temperature and it response to the increase in man-made greenhouse effect . As a result of it strong infrared absorption , water vapor is the most important naturally occurring greenhouse gas . Without water vapor , the earth surface temperature would be about 20 K lower , making the evolution of life , a we know it , impossible . The monitoring of water vapor and it evolution in time is therefore of utmost importance for our understanding of global climate change . Comparisons of trend derived from independent water vapor measurement from satellite and radiosondes facilitate the assessment of the significance of the observed change in water vapor . In this manuscript , the author have compared observed water vapor change and trend , derived from independent instrument , and assessed the statistical significance of their difference . This study deal with an example of the Behrens-Fisher problem , namely , the comparison of sample with different mean and different standard deviation , applied to trend from time series . Initially the Behrens-Fisher problem for the derivation of the consolidated change and trend is solved using standard ( frequentist ) hypothesis testing by performing the Welch test . Second , a Bayesian model selection is applied to solve the Behrens-Fisher problem by integrating the posterior probability numerically by using the algorithm Differential Evolution Markov Chain ( DEMC ) . Additionally , an analytical approximative solution of the Bayesian posterior probability is derived by mean of a quadratic Taylor series expansion applied in a computationally efficient manner to large datasets . The two statistical method used in the study yield similar result for the comparison of the water vapor change and trend from the different measurement , yielding a consolidated and consistent behavior .

aVMicroalgal biomass a feedstock for biofuel production is rapidly gaining appreciation in response to the increasing petroleum price and the upsurge in global warming concern . However , the process of creating concentrated biomass from microalgal culture is limited by ineffective dewatering procedure . The economics of existing culture clarification unit operation make the process of creating biomass from microalgae unattractive for biofuel development . This work involves the comparison of the removal efficiency ( recovery ) of two marine microalgae specie Chlorococcum sp . and Tetraselmis sp . by electrocoagulation ( EC ) , a technique that ha not been thoroughly explored in marine microalgae dewatering . High recovery efficiency were obtained of up to 99 and 98 % for Tetraselmis sp . and Chlorococcum sp. , respectively . The effect of culture temperature and salinity on removal efficiency wa also observed . A starting temperature of 60 degree C resulted in optimal recovery value of 96 and 94 % for Chlorococcum sp . and Tetraselmis sp. , respectively . Whereas a starting temperature of 5 degree C achieved optimal recovery of only Sand 68 % for Chlorococcum sp . and Tetraselmis sp. , respectively . Increased salinity of microalgae culture showed increased microalgae recovery . Salinity of 20 % gave optimal microalgae recovery value of only 6 and 9 % for Chlorococcum sp . and Tetraselmis sp. , respectively . Zeta potential ( ZP ) analysis wa carried out to verify and further understand the charge neutralization mechanism due to Fe ( 2+ ) cation . ( C ) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All right reserved .

aVClimate change is recognized to be one of the most serious challenge facing mankind today . Driven by anthropogenic activity , it is known to be a direct threat to our food and water supply and an indirect threat to world security . Increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas in the atmosphere will certainly affect hydrological regime . The consequent global warming is expected to have major implication on water resource management . The objective of this research is to present a general approach for evaluating the impact of potential climate change on streamflow in a river basin in the humid tropical zone of India . Large-scale global climate model ( GCMs ) are the best available tool to provide estimate of the effect of rising greenhouse gas on rainfall and temperature . However the spatial resolution of these model ( 250 km x 250 km ) is not compatible with that of watershed hydrological model . Hence the output from GCMs have to be downscaled using regional climate model ( RCMs ) , so a to project the output of a GCM to a finer resolution ( 50 km x 50 km ) . In the present work , the projection of a GCM for two scenario , A2 and B2 are downscaled by a RCM to project future climate in a watershed . Projections for two important climate variable , viz , rainfall and temperature are made . These are then used a input for a physically-based hydrological model , SWAT , in order to evaluate the effect of climate change on streamflow and vegetative growth in a humid tropical watershed .

aVClimate change is impacting multiple aspect of life , many of which resonate with the wellbeing of humankind . Indigenous people , including First Nations and Inuit community around the world are more vulnerable to the risk associated with global warming . In this synthesis , example of direct and indirect impact and vulnerability on First Nations and Inuit people inhabiting Canada have been provided . Examples from other country a a reminder that these population are not alone have also been included . After visiting the topic of biophysical environment , cultural identity , cultural activity , food security and health with respect to First Nations and Inuit people conclusion on adaptation within the context of change ha been given . The paper stress also the importance of linking health to cultural identity and land use . To fully grasp the impact of climate change on First Nations and the Inuit , government stakeholder , policy maker , a well a researcher need to understand the connection that these people retain with their land . Reports from the Nunatsiaq News related to climate change to reiterate the concern of Inuit people have been compiled . Graphs , stemming from the compilation , indicate what are perceived a the growing problem linked to climate change in these community . In order to take a positive , forward thinking , inclusive action , at the local level science will need to team up with traditional knowledge .

aVThe increase in intensity of torrential rain of Romania over the last decade , a a consequence of the general tendency of global warming , ha triggered many flash-floods especially in small and very small river basin which in turn have generated a lot of damage , from loss of human life to important material prejudice . The paper focus on determining the vulnerability degree of small river basin from Some river basin regarding flash-floods in general and is composed primarily of two part : in the first part we have presented one of the most destructive flash flood that took place in Some river basin , on the 20-21 June 2006 , in the second part we have calculated an index that estimate the vulnerability degree that small river basin from Some river basin have when discussing the matter of flash flood .

aVThe 18.6-year nodal tide is a component of all tide gauge record . It can affect estimate of sea level acceleration , in particular for tide gauge record with length of le than 60 year . We provide an analytic solution that show the effect of the nodal tide on estimate of sea level trend and acceleration . By adding a term to the least square formulation used to estimate sea level trend and acceleration , we can account for the nodal tide and eliminate it effect on the estimate . Using representative world-wide tide gauge record , we demonstrate that accounting for the nodal tide can improve estimate , particularly of acceleration .

aVMany annual monitoring program assume that availability the probability that an animal will be visible , make an audible sound , or leave other evidence of it presence is not changing systematically from year to year . Until recently , this assumption of unchanging availability seemed reasonable , but recent study report change in breeding phenology that are presumed to be linked to climate change . Because the rate of bird song is often correlated with stage of breeding , earlier breeding could shift timing of peak bird availability , changing the number of bird counted during annual survey on set date . Such change could be erroneously interpreted a population trend . To better understand how change in phenology might affect the probability of detecting bird , we modeled availability of 31 specie in southern Alabama through the breeding season , documenting strong seasonal variation in availability . Then , using our availability estimate , we investigated whether change in detection probability could underlie observed change in the abundance of some specie . We calculated the expected change in the number of time a specie would be recorded during survey conducted within fixed date by assuming a 1-week shift in breeding activity . We found that summer resident were more likely to show change in availability but that such change in availability did not account for trend in Breeding Bird Survey ( BBS ) data for Alabama . Our result suggest that while summer resident ' availability may be declining during BBS date , population decline observed in BBS data for Alabama can not be dismissed a due to shifting phenology .

aVAdaptation to climate change ha recently become a crucial element on the climate change policy agenda a it is now recognized that even the most stringent mitigation effort may not arrest the effect of climate warming . The ecological impact and cost of predicted weather-related extreme event , such a extreme temperature , are not fully understood and may present unexpected challenge to conservationist that require solution . In Portugal , provisioning of artificial nest ha been the main driver of the spectacular increase in the endangered lesser kestrel population . Nevertheless , atypically high temperature recorded during the 2009 breeding season coincided with a mortality of 22 % of surveyed chick in provided nest . Hot day did not affected prey delivery rate to the nestling , suggesting that the die-off wa due to chick ' acute dehydration . Chick mortality wa significantly higher amongst younger individual . Within survivor , physiological cost of high temperature significantly affected chick growth and body condition at fledging . Nest-site microclimate wa influenced by nest-type and compass orientation : wooden nest-boxes attained the highest temperature , exceeding 55 degree C when facing south , so explaining the recorded higher mortality , lower growth rate and lower fledging body condition among brood in these nest . Simulated scenario of global warming with increasing occupation rate of artificial nest due to reduction in alternative predicted a reduction in population growth rate . In the worst scenario , with a 100 % occupancy of nest-boxes , the population growth would decline on average 7 % per year . The impact of high temperature on lesser kestrel breeding success highlight a need for action to modify and research to adapt conservation effort and future planning to account for climate change .

aVPredation affect life history trait of nearly all organism and the population consequence of predator avoidance are often larger than predation itself . Climate change ha been shown to cause phenological change . These change are not necessarily similar between specie and may cause mismatch between prey and predator . Eurasian sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus , the main predator of passerine , ha advanced it autumn phenology by about ten day in 30 year due to climate change . However , we do not know if sparrowhawk migrate earlier in response to earlier migration by it prey or if earlier sparrowhawk migration result in change to predation risk on it prey . By using the median departure date of 41 passerine specie I wa able to show that early migrating passerine tend to advance , and late migrating specie delay their departure , but none of the specie have advanced their departure time a much a the sparrowhawk . This ha lead to a situation of increased predation risk on early migrating long-distance migrant ( LDM ) and decreased the overlap of migration season with later departing short-distance migrant ( SDM ) . Findings highlight the growing list of problem of declining LDM population caused by climate change . On the other hand it seems that the autumn migration may become safer for SDM whose population are growing . Results demonstrate that passerine show very conservative response in autumn phenology to climate change , and thus phenological mismatch caused by global warming are not necessarily increasing towards the higher trophic level .

aVThis study concern the thermotolerance of spore of mesophilic fungi isolated from a tropical semi-arid habitat subject to dry season fire in the Western Ghats , southern India . Among 25 specie of Ascomycota isolated from leaf litter , nine were able to grow after incubation in a drying oven for 2 h at 100 degree C ; the spore of two of these specie survived 2 h incubation at 110 degree C , and one survived exposure to 115 degree C for 2 h. The range of thermotolerance among mesophilic fungi isolated from the leaf litter wa surprising : filamentous fungi from other habitat , including specie that colonize scorched vegetation after fire and thermophilic form occurring in self-heating plant compost , can not survive even brief exposure to such high temperature . It is possible that the exceptional heat resistance of the Indian fungi is related to adaptation to surviving fire . Genetic analysis of the physiological mechanism of heat resistance in these fungi offer prospect for future biotechnological innovation . The discovery of extreme thermotolerance among common saprotrophs show that this physiological trait may be more widespread than recognized previously , adding to concern about the evolution of opportunistic pathogen on a warmer planet . The fungi in this study are among the most heat-resistant eukaryote on record and are referred to here a 'Agni 's Fungi ' , after the Hindu God of Fire . ( C ) 2011 British Mycological Society .

aVGlobal monthly precipitation is a critical element in understanding variability of the Earth 's climate including change in the hydrological cycle associated with global warming . The NCEP reanalysis ( R1 ) , GPCP , CMAP , and TMPA precipitation data set are often used in climate study . This study compare the data set ( R1 , GPCP , CMAP , and TMPA ) with the TRMM precipitation data set derived from the TRMM precipitation radar ( TPR ) , microwave imager ( TMI ) , and combined algorithm ( TCA ) for 11 year ( 1998-2008 ) over the satellite 's domain ( 40 degree S-40 degree N ) . The domain precipitation estimate from seven data set range from 2.44 to 3.38 mm d ( 1 ) over the ocean and from 1.98 to 2.83 mm d ( 1 ) over land . The regional difference between the TPR and the other data set are analyzed by a paired t test . Particularly , statistically significant difference between TPR and GPCP and between TPR and CMAP are found in most oceanic region and in some land area . In general , there exists substantial disagreement in precipitation intensity from the precipitation data set . Therefore , significant consideration is given to the uncertainty in the data set prior to applying the result to climate study such a estimation of the global hydrological budget analysis . Meanwhile , the anomaly from all the data set agree relatively well in their variability pattern . It is also found that the dominant mode of interannual variability which is associated with the ENSO pattern is clearly demonstrated by all precipitation data set . These result suggest that all considered precipitation data set may produce similar result when they are used for climate variability analysis on annual to interannual time scale .

aVClimatic change will decouple the matching between genotype and environment . Studying the patterning of genetic variation among pine population along altitudinal gradient under simulated climatic change temperature , would provide insight about how to realign the present population to future environment . Fourteen Pinus patula population from the forest of the Native Indian Community of Ixtlan de Juarez , state of Oaxaca , Mexico , were collected in January-March 2005 and 2006 along an altitudinal gradient ( 2400 m to 3050 m , one population every 50 m of altitudinal difference ) . Seedlings were grown in growth chamber at the Laurentides Forestry Center , Quebec city , Canada , under two temperature treatment aiming to simulate : contemporary temperature ( average 17 degree C ) and a future global warming scenario ( average 21 degree C ) . Seedlings were evaluated after inducing a second growing season ( between 8 and 12 month of age ) . Populations differed significantly ( p < = 0.001 ) for seedling height and aerial dry weight , and exhibited a significant ( p < = 0.02 ) although weak altitudinal clinal pattern , with population from lower altitude having on average taller and heavier seedling than population from higher altitude ( r ( 2 ) =0.064 and r ( 2 ) =0.094 ) .

aVP > 1 . The infrared ( IR ) heating technique used in terrestrial vegetation warming experiment ha been continuously improved over the past two decade , but the temperature control method applied thus far inadequately reflect natural condition . 2 . Current control method base the IR radiation administered on measured canopy or air temperature . However , these temperature are influenced by stomatal response of the vegetation , which depend on moisture condition and therefore also on warming . In nature , drought-stressed vegetation warms up more than well-watered vegetation , leading to potential difference in heat stress . Current control method preclude such difference from developing . 3 . We propose an alternative approach to render temperature control independent of plant response . Theoretical canopy temperature associated with given ( target ) air temperature are calculated , based on reference canopy conductance determined from control and fluctuating meteorological condition . The IR radiation needed to attain the theoretical temperature is subsequently applied . Actual canopy and air temperature are free to deviate from that temperature , a measured temperature no longer control the heater ' radiation output . 4 . Synthesis . We devised an alternative control method for IR heater that is independent of plant response to heating . This is especially critical in extreme event study , where difference in plant water status , and therefore canopy temperature , are likely to be exacerbated .

aVThe future of the potato production in Brazil is discussed upon prediction of temperature rise due to global warming . A literature review wa carried out on the effect of high temperature on the potato plant metabolism , and their consequence upon vegetative development and yield . Although higher emphasis wa devoted to the climate effect on food production , the risk of genetic erosion by disappearance of wild specie is stressed , with consequence to the future of plant breeding . Based on this information and on climate data from the main growing region published on Brazilian document , we carried out a prospective analysis of the potato production in Brazil . For that , a temperature rise of up to 5 degree C wa considered to the end of the century , and the range of 10 degree C to 25 degree C a the optimum for potato growth , according to specialized literature . For the study , six county , representative of the main growing region , were selected : Sao Joaquim , Santa Catarina State ; Guarapuava , Parana State ; Cristalina , Goias State ; Mucuge , Bahia State ; Vargem Grande do Sul , Sao Paulo State and Araxa , Minas Gerais State . For cooler county , such a Sao Joaquim , major drawback on potato production are not expected , even though adjustment in planting season should be required . However , cropping on those county subject to high temperature which today allow potato production all year round , like Mucuge , and Cristalina , is expected to be restricted to few month of the year . The aim of this article wa to alert , not alarm , the Brazilian potato chain in order to promote the management change to preserve the crop in case the expected temperature rise come true . In addition , the role of plant breeding to counteract the negative effect of high temperature is discussed .

aVAntarctica is the most isolated continent on Earth , but it ha not escaped the negative impact of human activity . The unique marine ecosystem of Antarctica and their endemic fauna are affected on local and regional scale by overharvesting , pollution , and the introduction of alien specie . Global climate change is also having deleterious impact : rising sea temperature and ocean acidification already threaten benthic and pelagic food web . The Antarctic Treaty System can address local- to regional-scale impact , but it doe not have purview over the global problem that impinge on Antarctica , such a emission of greenhouse gas . Failure to address human impact simultaneously at all scale will lead to the degradation of Antarctic marine ecosystem and the homogenization of their composition , structure , and process with marine ecosystem elsewhere .

aVThe environmental concern on soil exploitation , linked to global warming by the Kyoto protocol , is responsible for increasing interest in the understanding of the role of the composition and structure of the soil organic matter ( SOM ) on soil carbon , C , dynamic . Thermal analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) are applied to study the thermal property , the structure and composition of the SOM of six sample with different C content in order to improve the interpretation of result given by thermal analysis . Results showed that the direct integral of the combustion peak obtained by DSC and the percentage of SOM given by TG were both directly related to the quantity of total soil C. Thus , soil with higher C content showed higher energy content too . The combustion temperature of the curve given by DSC are those reported for labile OM . NMR result indicated the presence of aliphatic C , carbohydrate , and a weak signal in the aromatic C band in all the sample that wa not detected in the DSC curve . Only two sample showed carboxyl/carbonyl C which wa not detected by DSC also .

aVGlobal Warming is one of the major concern in environmental issue . Its effect are being exposed faster than anticipated recently . It cause adverse ecological and socioeconomical effect . The 4 ( th ) Assessment Report issued by the U.N. 's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) state that it is appropriate to define Global Warming wa caused by greenhouse gas due to human activity which play a significant role by over loading the atmosphere with carbon dioxide ( CO ( 2 ) ) emission since 1750 . One of the most effective way to prevent global warming is to replace material which emit high level of CO , with those of low level CO ( 2 ) emission material . Usually , CO ( 2 ) emission can be presented a embodied CO ( 2 ) ( ECO ( 2 ) ) and operational CO ( 2 ) emission . In this paper , appraisal of the embodied CO ( 2 ) emission level of using traditional building material ( i.e . cement , steel , glass and timber ) and alternative building material ( i.e . slag cement , recycle steel , cullet glass and plywood formwork ) have been made by case modelling . The result show that the amount of CO ( 2 ) emission is reduced after using alternative building material by more than one-third ( 34.8 % ) .

aVRainfall variability both within and between season , is reflected in highly variable crop growth and yield in rain fed agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa and result in varying degree of weather-induced risk associated with a wide range of crop , soil and water management innovation . In addition there is both growing evidence and concern that change in rainfall pattern associated with global warming may substantively aka the nature of such risk . Eighty nine , year of daily rainfall data from a site in southern Zambia are analysed . The analysis illustrate approach to assessing the extent of possible trend in rainfall pattern and the calculation of weather-induced risk associated with the inter- and intra-seasonal variability of the rainfall amount . Trend analysis use monthly rainfall total and the number of rain clay in each month . No simple trend were build . The daily data were then processed to examine important rain dependent aspect of crop production such a the date of the start of the rain and the risk of a long dry spell , both following planting and around flowering . The same approach is used to ass the risk of example of crop disease in instance when a 'weather trigger ' for the disease can be specified . A crop water satisfaction index is also used to compare risk from choice of crop with different maturity length and cropping strategy . Finally a different approach to the calculation of these risk fit a Markov chain model to the occurrence of rain , result then derived from this model . The analysis show the relevance of this latter approach when relatively short daily rainfall record are available and is illustrated through a comparison of the effect of El Nino , La Nina and Ordinary year on rainfall distribution pattern .

aVAlthough interest in assessing the relationship between temperature and mortality have arisen due to climate change , relatively few data are available on lag structure of temperature mortality relationship , particularly in the Southern Hemisphere . This study identified the lag effect of mean temperature on mortality among age group and death category using polynomial distributed lag model in Brisbane , Australia , a subtropical city , 1996-2004 . For a 1 degree C increase above the threshold , the highest percent increase in mortality on the current day occurred among people over 85 year ( 7.2 % ( 95 % Cl : 4.3 % , 10.2 % ) ) . The effect estimate among cardiovascular death were higher than those among all-cause mortality . For a 1 C decrease below the threshold , the percent increase in mortality at 21 lag day were 3.9 % ( 95 % Cl : 1.9 % , 6.0 % ) and 3.4 % ( 95 % Cl : 0.9 % , 6.0 % ) for people aged over 85 year and with cardiovascular disease , respectively . These finding may have implication for developing intervention strategy to reduce and prevent temperature-related mortality . ( C ) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

Future impact are expected to be greater because of global climate change in association with further rise in sea level . Beaches and dune system occupy large area along the coastline of the state of Veracruz on the Gulf of Mexico . The aim of this study is to establish the intrinsic vulnerability of nine dune field in Veracruz to current and future impact and to ass their integrated management status . These dune-beach system are more vulnerable to the effect of economic activity and land use change than to those induced by natural force . Results show that six of these dune system have medium vulnerability and an ecological conservation policy should be adopted ; the other three , with high or very high vulnerability , are candidate for a restoration policy .

aVThe equatorial Pacific atmosphere responds differently to global warming in the Gill-type and Lindzen-Nigam model . Under an assumption of no change in the zonal sea surface temperature ( SST ) gradient in the Gill-type model , the Walker circulation is intensified in a warmer climate relative to current climatic condition , while slightly weakened in the Lindzen-Nigam model . Furthermore , for more accurate derivation of the surface wind , the free atmosphere in the Gill-type model is combined with the atmospheric boundary layer . This modified Gill-type model actually produce weaker surface wind than the Gill-type model would , but the sensitivity of the Walker circulation to the warmer climate is similar to that obtained from the Gill-type model . These result may explain why the zonal gradient of equatorial Pacific SST during the twentieth century is observed to strengthen while the Walker circulation is not , even though they are dynamically linked .

aVA leading approach for large-scale electrochemical energy production with minimal global-warming gas emission is to use a renewable source of electricity , such a solar energy , to oxidize water , providing the abundant source of electron needed in fuel synthesis . We report corrosion-resistant , nanocomposite anode for the oxidation of water required to produce renewable fuel . Silicon , an earth-abundant element and an efficient photovoltaic material , is protected by atomic layer deposition ( ALD ) of a highly uniform , 2nm thick layer of titanium dioxide ( TiO ( 2 ) ) and then coated with an optically transmitting layer of a known catalyst ( 3nm iridium ) . Photoelectrochemical water oxidation wa observed to occur below the reversible potential whereas dark electrochemical water oxidationwas found to have low-to-moderate overpotentials at all pH value , resulting in an inferred photovoltage of similar to 550 mV . Water oxidation is sustained at these anode for many hour in harsh pH and oxidative environment whereas comparable silicon anode without the TiO ( 2 ) coating quickly fail . The desirable electrochemical efficiency and corrosion resistance of these anode is made possible by the low electron-tunnelling resistance ( < 0.006 Omega cm ( 2 ) for p ( + ) -Si ) and uniform thickness of atomic-layer deposited TiO ( 2 ) .

aVPast attribution study of climate change have assumed a null hypothesis of no role of human activity . The challenge , then , is to prove that there is an anthropogenic component . I argue that because global warming is `` unequivocal '' and 'very likely ' caused by human activity , the reverse should now be the case . The task , then , could be to prove there is no anthropogenic component to a particular observed change in climate , although a more useful task is to determine what it is . In Bayesian statistic , this change might be thought of a adding a 'prior ' . The benefit of doubt and uncertainty about observation and model are then switched . Moreover , the science community is much too conservative on this issue and too many author make what are called 'Type II error ' whereby they erroneously accept the null hypothesis . Global warming is contributing to a changing incidence of extreme weather because the environment in which all storm form ha changed from human activity . ( C ) 2011 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd .

aVAustralian agriculture ha operated successfully in one of the world 's most hostile environment for two century . However , climate change is posing serious challenge to it ongoing success . Determining what might constitute dangerous climate change for Australian agriculture is not an easy task , a most climate-related risk are associated with change in the highly uncertain hydrological cycle rather than directly to more predictable change in temperature . In addition , the adaptive capacity of Australian producer is generally high , a they have had to cope with a highly variable climate in which periodic , severe drought are the norm . As the underlying global trend in climate interact with the continent 's pattern of natural variability , producer can generally deal with gradual change in climate but are most concerned about high rate of change in regional and local climate and with abrupt , unexpected shift in climate pattern . Perhaps the best indicator of dangerous climate change for Australian agriculture is the persistence , or not , of the drying trend in many of the Country 's most productive region and the strength of the linkage between these trend and global climate change .

aVGlobal warming is creating the need to incorporate a considerable amount of knowledge on diversity and functionality into management plan , but this is not always an easy task . We have developed an approach that includes the analysis of biodiversity measure and their relation with physiographic or soil parameter , for use in forestry management plan in Hoyocasero ( central Spain ) . Considering the richness in forest plant and according to their morphological and functional trait , we grouped the specie present under the canopy into four group . Then we have calculated their richness and biodiversity index and for the set of plant a a whole . The specie group showed difference in richness and diversity index for the two forest type in the study , while the set of plant a a whole wa not sensitive enough to detect variation in the quality of the floristic specie . The use of diversity index applied to particular specie group proved to be a useful method of defining level of forest quality . This methodology ha enabled u to establish that the pinewood is in a better state of conservation than the oakwood . ( C ) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVThe exchange of the important trace gas , methane ( CH ( 4 ) ) , nitrous oxide ( N ( 2 ) O ) , and carbon dioxide ( CO ( 2 ) ) , between forested soil and the atmosphere can show great temporal and spatial variability . We measured the flux of these three gas over 2 year along catena at two forested site , to determine the important control . Well-drained soil consumed atmospheric CH ( 4 ) , while poorly drained swamp soil embedded in depression were a source . CH ( 4 ) flux could be predicted primarily by temperature and moisture , and tree cover exerted an influence mainly through the creation of large soil porosity , leading to increased consumption rate . In contrast , there were very poor relationship between N ( 2 ) O flux and environmental variable , reflecting the complex interaction of microbial , edaphic , and N cycling process , such a nitrification in well-drained soil and denitrification in poorly drained soil , which led to N ( 2 ) O production ( or consumption ) in soil and hence larger variability . At the broad temporal and spatial scale , soil C : N ratio wa a good predictor of N ( 2 ) O emission rate , through it influence upon N cycling process . Soil CO ( 2 ) emission rate showed le spatial and temporal variability , and were controlled by temperature and moisture . The source strength , in global warming potential of CH ( 4 ) and N ( 2 ) O flux in CO ( 2 ) equivalent , wa reduced markedly when trace gas flux from 5 to 15 % poorly drained soil were included in the net global warming potential calculation of whole forested watershed . Soils drainage class integrates many of the biogeochemical process controlling the flux of these gas providing a framework for extrapolating result .

aVBiorefining , a promising alternative to petrochemistry . Because of the price increase of fossil resource , of their uncertain availability and because of environmental concern , alternative solution able to mitigate global warming , and reduce the consumption of fossil fuel and carbon dioxide emission should be promoted . The replacement of petroleum with biomass a raw material for bioenergy ( biofuels , power and heat ) and chemical production is an interesting option and is the driving force for the development of biorefinery complex that will have a critical role to play in our common future . A biorefinery is a facility that integrates biomass conversion process and equipment to produce fuel , power , heat and chemical from biomass . In biorefinery , almost all type of biomass feedstock can be converted to different class of biofuels and biochemicals through various process that maximize economic and environmental benefit , while minimizing waste and pollution . Through the integration of green chemistry into biorefineries , and the use of low environmental impact technology , future sustainable production chain of biofuels and high value chemical from biomass can therefore be established . Currently , the green biorefinery , the whole-crop biorefinery , the oilseed biorefinery and the lignocellulosic feedstock biorefinery are favoured in research , development and industrial implementation , essentially through fully integrated biorefinery complex .

aVThe flow boiling heat transfer coefficient of the low-GWP ( global warming potential ) refrigerant HFO-1234yf inside a smooth small-diameter horizontal tube ( inner diameter : 2 mm ) wa experimentally investigated . The local heat transfer coefficient wa measured at heat flux of 6-24 kW m ( -2 ) , mass flux of 100-400 kg m ( -2 ) s ( -1 ) , an evaporating temperature of 288.15 K , and an inlet vapor quality of 0-0.25 . The result show that the effect of heat flux on the heat transfer wa large at low vapor quality , while the effect of mass flux wa large at high vapor quality . The heat transfer coefficient of HFO-1234yf wa almost the same a that of R-134a . The heat transfer coefficient calculated based on correlation with Saitoh et al . agreed well with the measured value compared to other correlation . The measured pressure drop agreed well with that predicted by the Lockhart-Martinelli correlation . ( C ) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and IIR . All right reserved .

aVP > The seasonal timing of growth event is crucial to tree distribution and conservation . The seasonal growth cycle is strongly adapted to the local climate that is changing because of global warming . We studied bud set a one cornerstone of the seasonal growth cycle in an integrative approach . Bud set wa dissected at the phenotypic level into several component , and phenotypic component with most genetic variation were identified . While phenotypic variation resided in the timing of growth cessation , and even so more in the duration from growth cessation to bud set , the timing of growth cessation had a stronger genetic component in both natural and hybrid population . Quantitative trait locus ( QTL ) were identified for the most discriminative phenotypic bud-set component across four poplar pedigree . The QTL from different pedigree were recurrently detected in six region of the poplar genome . These region of 1.83-4.25 Mbp in size , containing between 202 and 394 gene , form the basis for further molecular-genetic dissection of bud set .

aVGlobal warming is one of the most important problem of the present day . The increase of carbon dioxide ( CO ( 2 ) ) and other greenhouse gas cause a great problem in the atmosphere . However , CO ( 2 ) gas constituted the biggest threat at present , though the other gas increase , too . One of the primary precaution to take for this is the context of soil earth atmospheric CO ( 2 ) through plant . Beside the context of soil carbon , some other factor are also affecting this context . Some of them are texture , bulk density ( BD ) , cation exchange capacity ( CEC ) , exchangeable cation ( EC ) , soil reaction ( pH ) and electrical conductivity ( Ec ) . In Harran plain , an organic carbon amount ranged from 0.28 to 4.95 kg C m ( -2 ) . The statistic analysis data in the factor are : BD , organic carbon ( OC ) , texture ( clay , silt and sand % ) , CEC , EC , pH and Ec . The strongest correlation wa found a BD and OC ( R ( 2 ) = 99.96 ) , but when compared with the other factor , it wa detected a R ( 2 ) = 99.4 . The reason for it height when we consider all the parameter is the involvement of organic carbon in the calculation . When we deal with them individually , the correlation fall below 50 % . In this study , a point of high correlation is made between OC and BD . The study aim to determine , in the soil , BD , which is costly , hard and time consuming , and OC which is known by mean of this correlation . In the comparison analysis of the entire data and the determination of the equation , student t test wa used and the data were investigated at p < 0.01 significance level . However , ANOVA technique were used regularly in this comparison .

aVThe modern pole-to-equator sea-level temperature difference is about 50 degree C ; that of the mid-Cretaceous ranged from 30 degree C to a little a 24 degree C , implying a much more equable climate . This may have been caused by 1 ) reduction of the ice-forced albedo of the polar region , 2 ) more efficient meridional energy transport by the atmosphere and ocean , and 3 ) increased atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration . Earth 's icy polar region stabilize it present 'inequable ' climate through the ice-albedo feedback effect The polar ice result in permanent atmospheric high that stabilize Earth 's wind system . In turn the stable wind drive the ocean current and determine the location of the frontal system that separate the low- and high-latitude oceanic gyre system and bound the region where water sink into the ocean interior a thermocline and intermediate water mass . Increased ocean heat transport can assist in making a more equable climate , but unrealistic volume transport would be required to warm the polar region to Cretaceous level . The major factor forcing the equable climate of the Cretaceous is now thought to be increased greenhouse gas concentration , dominated by CO ( 2 ) . The modern rate of change in atmospheric concentration is greater than 200 ppmv per century and increasing . This compare with 1 ppmv per century during the last deglaciation . At current rate of fossil fuel burning , atmospheric CO ( 2 ) level will reach Cretaceous level of 2 time the pre-industrial level about 2070 and 8 time the pre-industrial level shortly after 2300 . It is likely that Cretaceous atmospheric CO ( 2 ) concentration will last for many thousand to ten of thousand of year . In addition to increased atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration , a return to climatic condition resembling those of the Cretaceous would require ice-free pole and large change in atmospheric and oceanic circulation . Arctic sea-ice is melting much more rapidly than had been expected , and the Arctic Ocean will soon be free of sea-ice in summer . The Greenland ice sheet is melting more rapidly than expected because of greenhouse warming . Surface meltwater form lake , and then flow down through crevasse and hole in the ice to lubricate the base , allowing ice steam to flow much more rapidly . The lifetime of the Greenland ice sheet may be only a few hundred year . The West Antarctic ice sheet is inherently unstable , being grounded on rock well below sea level . The ice shelf blocking ice stream off West Antarctica have begun to melt from beneath and break up a the southern ocean warms . The East Antarctic ice sheet ha been regarded a highly stable but discovery of lake beneath the ice and fast-flowing ice stream raise question about whether the ice sheet will ultimately succumb to global warming and disintegrate . I conclude that a return to climatic condition resembling those of the mid-Cretaceous is not only possible but also likely unless humanity can organize an effective campaign to stop CO ( 2 ) emission to the atmosphere and remove some of the excess CO ( 2 ) already introduced .

aVCarbon footprint ha become a term often used by the medium in recent day . The human carbon footprint is professed to be a very serious global threat and every nation is looking at the possible option to reduce it since it consequence are alarming . A carbon footprint is a measure of the impact of human activity on earth and in particular on the environment ; more specifically it relates to climate change and to the total amount of greenhouse gas produced , measured in unit of carbon dioxide emitted . Effort of individual in minimizing the carbon footprint is vital to save our planet . This article report a study of the carbon footprint of various type of shopping bag ( plastic , paper , non-woven and woven ) using life cycle impact assessment ( LCIA ) technique in two stage . The first stage ( baseline study ) , comprised the study of the impact of different type of shopping bag in the manufacturing phase , without considering their usage and disposal phase ( cradle to gate stage ) . The LCIA wa accomplished by the IPCC 2007 method , developed by the Inter Panel on Climate Change in SIMAPRO 7.2 . The GWP ( Global Warming Potential ) value calculated by the IPCC 2007 method for 100 year were considered a a directive to compare the carbon footprint made by the different type of shopping bag under consideration . The next stage wa the study of the carbon footprint of these bag including their usage and disposal phase ( cradle to grave stage ) and the result derived were compared with the result derived from the baseline study , which is the major focus of this research work . The value for usage and end-of-life phase were obtained from the survey questionnaire performed amongst different user group of shopping bag in China , Hong Kong and India . The result show that the impact of different type of shopping bag ill term of their carbon footprint potential is very high if no usage and disposal option were provided . When the carbon footprint value from different disposal option were compared , the carbon footprint value were lower in the case where a higher percentage of reuse is preferred to recycling and disposing to landfill . The result indicate that a higher percentage of reuse could significantly scale down the carbon footprint . Once the shopping bag reached the point where they can no longer be reused , they must be forwarded to recycling option , rather than being disposed to landfill . At this juncture , consumer 's perception and behaviour in connection with the respective government 's policy in promoting 82 facilitating recycling system could be critical in reducing the carbon footprint of various shopping bag .

aVCoal combustion by-product such a fly ash ( FA ) , brine and CO ( 2 ) from coal fired power plant have the potential to impact negatively on the environment . FA and brine can contaminate the soil , surface and ground water through leaching of toxic element present in their matrix while CO ( 2 ) ha been identified a a green house gas that contributes significantly towards the global warming effect . Reaction of CO ( 2 ) with FA/brine slurry can potentially provide a viable route for CO ( 2 ) sequestration via formation of mineral carbonate . Fractionated FA ha varying amount of CaO which not only increase the brine pH but can also be converted into an environmentally benign calcite . Carbonation efficiency of fractionated and brine impacted FA wa investigated in this study . Controlled carbonation reaction were carried out in a reactor set-up to evaluate the effect of fractionation on the carbonation efficiency of FA . Chemical and mineralogical characteristic of fresh and carbonated ash were evaluated using XRF , SEM , and XRD . Brine effluent were characterized using ICP-MS and IC . A factorial experimental approach wa employed in testing the variable . The 20-150 mu m size fraction wa observed to have the highest CO ( 2 ) sequestration potential of 71.84 kg of CO ( 2 ) per ton of FA while the > 150 mu m particle had the lowest potential of 36.47 kg of CO ( 2 ) per ton of FA . Carbonation using brine resulted in higher degree of calcite formation compared to the ultra-pure water carbonated residue . ( c ) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVThe city merit special attention in global warming since they produce up to 80 % of the global greenhouse gas emission . Even though this ha been widely acknowledged , only few paper exist that have studied city holistically from a demand , i.e. , consumption , perspective . The study present a detailed analysis of the carbon footprint of two metropolitan city from a consumption perspective . With the analysis of consumer carbon footprint ( carbon consumption ) , the distribution of emission in the key source category is presented and compared . The study utilizes Finnish consumer survey data by city , regional emission data for key process , and general emission data to produce a hybrid LCA model for a holistic assessment of city-level greenhouse gas emission from the consumption perspective . The study result showed the carbon consumption to be 13.2 t CO2e per person in Helsinki with a 17,400 a , not sign annual consumption expenditure and 10.3 t CO2e per person in Porvoo with a 15,900 a , not sign annual consumption expenditure , respectively . The dominant carbon source for metropolitan living are heat and electricity , building and property , private driving , and service . Within the city , some significant difference were found . The carbon emission from energy consumption are 4.5 t CO2e for an average consumer in Helsinki , whereas an average consumer in Porvoo only cause 2.0 t CO2e due to the cleaner energy production in Porvoo . On the other hand , private driving cause 2.0 t CO2e in Porvoo , but only 1.3 t in Helsinki . The overall trip generation in Helsinki is only half of that in Porvoo , and also , the usage of public transport is at a substantially higher level in Helsinki . The current result contradict interestingly some earlier study in finding that the theoretical carbon-reducing influence of city density is overridden with other factor , such a the type of energy production , energy efficiency of the housing stock , and increased use of service . In our study , Helsinki represents a metropolitan area with a denser structure and a more efficient public transport system , but still consuming around 25 % more carbon emission than the other city in the metropolitan area , Porvoo . The sensitivity analysis showed that even with the normalization of the key parameter between the two city , the main finding still hold . The evaluation of the carbon footprint of city from the consumption perspective , instead of a more traditional production perspective , seems to offer an interesting new insight into the carbon footprint of the city . It identifies similar key source of carbon a production-oriented study but further emphasizes the significance of the utilized service in the carbon footprint evaluation . In the future , the carbon footprint of service , especially in the service-intensive economy and city that tend to outsource their manufacturing and carbon emission , should be further examined since they cause an ever increasing proportion of the carbon consumption of consumer .

aVConcerns about diminishing fossil fuel reserve along with global warming effect caused by increasing level of CO ( 2 ) in the atmosphere are driving society toward the search for new renewable source of energy that can substitute for coal , natural gas and petroleum in the current energy system . Lignocellulosic biomass is abundant , and it ha the potential to significantly displace petroleum in the production of fuel for the transportation sector . Ethanol , the main biomass-derived fuel used today , ha benefited from production by a well-established technology and by partial compatibility with the current transportation infrastructure , leading to the domination of the world biofuel market . However , ethanol suffers from important limitation a a fuel ( e.g. , low energy density , high solubility in water ) than can be overcome by designing strategy to convert non-edible lignocellulosic biomass into liquid hydrocarbon fuel ( LHF ) chemically similar to those currently used in internal combustion engine . The present review describes the main route available to carry out such deep chemical transformation ( e. g. , gasification , pyrolysis , and aqueous-phase catalytic processing ) , with particular emphasis on those pathway involving aqueous-phase catalytic reaction . These latter catalytic route achieve the required transformation in biomass-derived molecule with controlled chemistry and high yield , but require pretreatment/hydrolysis step to overcome the recalcitrance of lignocellulose . To be economically viable , these aqueous-phase route should be carried out with a small number of reactor and with minimum utilization of external fossil fuel-based hydrogen source , a illustrated in the example presented here .

aVThe future of tropical forest ha become one of the iconic issue in climate-change science . A number of study that have explored this subject have tended to focus on the output from one or a few climate model , which work at low spatial resolution , whereas society and conservation-relevant assessment of potential impact requires a finer scale . This study focus on the role of climate on the current and future distribution of humid tropical forest ( HTFs ) . We first characterize their contemporary climatological niche using annual rainfall and maximum climatological water stress , which also adequately describe the current distribution of other biome within the tropic . As a first-order approximation of the potential extent of HTFs in future climate regime defined by global warming of 2 degree C and 4 degree C , we investigate change in the niche through a combination of climate-change anomaly pattern and higher resolution ( 5 km ) map of current climatology . The climate anomaly are derived using data from 17 coupled Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models ( AOGCMs ) used in the Fourth Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change . Our result confirm some risk of forest retreat , especially in eastern Amazonia , Central America and part of Africa , but also indicate a potential for expansion in other region , for example around the Congo Basin . The finer spatial scale enabled the depiction of potential resilient and vulnerable zone with practically useful detail . We further refine these estimate by considering the impact of new environmental regime on plant water demand using the UK Met Office land- surface scheme ( of the HadCM3 AOGCM ) . The CO ( 2 ) -related reduction in plant water demand lower the risk of die-back and can lead to possible niche expansion in many region . The analysis presented here focus primarily on hydrological determinant of HTF extent . We conclude by discussing the role of other factor , notably the physiological effect of higher temperature .

aVUsing the high-quality observed meteorological data , change of the thermal condition and precipitation over the North China Plain from 1961 to 2009 were examined . Trends of accumulated temperature and negative temperature , growing season duration , a well a seasonal and annual rainfall at 48 station were analyzed . The result show that the accumulated temperature increased significantly by 348.5 degree C day due to global warming during 1961-2009 while the absolute accumulated negative temperature decreased apparently by 175.3 degree C day . The start of growing season displayed a significant negative trend of -14.3 day during 1961-2009 , but the end of growing season delayed insignificantly by 6.7 day . As a result , the length of growing season increased by 21.0 day . The annual and autumn rainfall decreased slightly while summer rainfall and summer rainy day decreased significantly . In contrast , spring rainfall increased slightly without significant trend . All the result indicate that the thermal condition were improved to benefit the crop growth over the North China Plain during 1961-2009 , and the decreasing annual and summer rainfall had no direct negative impact on the crop growth . But the decreasing summer rainfall wa likely to influence the water resource in North China , especially the underground water , reservoir water , a well a river runoff , which would have influenced the irrigation of agriculture .

aVBackground : Temperate fruit and nut tree require adequate winter chill to produce economically viable yield . Global warming ha the potential to reduce available winter chill and greatly impact crop yield . Methodology/Principal Findings : We estimated winter chill for two past ( 1975 and 2000 ) and 18 future scenario ( mid and end 21st century ; 3 Global Climate Models [ GCMs ] ; 3 greenhouse gas emission [ GHG ] scenario ) . For 4,293 weather station around the world and GCM projection , Safe Winter Chill ( SWC ) , the amount of winter chill that is exceeded in 90 % of all year , wa estimated for all scenario using the `` Dynamic Model '' and interpolated globally . We found that SWC ranged between 0 and about 170 Chill Portions ( CP ) for all climate scenario , but that the global distribution varied across scenario . Warm region are likely to experience severe reduction in available winter chill , potentially threatening production there . In contrast , SWC in most temperate growing region is likely to remain relatively unchanged , and cold region may even see an increase in SWC . Climate change impact on SWC differed quantitatively among GCMs and GHG scenario , with the highest GHG leading to loss up to 40 CP in warm region , compared to 20 CP for the lowest GHG . Conclusions/Significance : The extent of projected change in winter chill in many major growing region of fruit and nut indicates that grower of these commodity will likely experience problem in the future . Mitigation of climate change through reduction in greenhouse gas emission can help reduce the impact , however , adaption to change will have to occur . To better prepare for likely impact of climate change , effort should be undertaken to breed tree cultivar for lower chilling requirement , to develop tool to cope with insufficient winter chill , and to better understand the temperature response of tree crop .

aVBoth tropical and temperate specie are responding to global warming through range shift , but our understanding of the consequence of these shift for whole community is limited . Here , we use current elevational range data for six taxonomic group spanning 90 degree in latitude to examine the potential impact of climate-driven range shift on community change , or disassembly , across latitude . Elevational range are smaller at low latitude for most group and , a a consequence , tropical community appear to be more sensitive to temperature increase compared with temperate community . Under site-specific temperature projection , we generally found greater community disassembly in tropical compared with temperate community , although this varied by dispersal assumption . Mountain height can impact the amount of community disassembly , with greater change occurring on smaller mountain . Finally , projected community disassembly wa higher for ectotherm than endotherms , although the variation among ectotherm wa greater than the variation separating endotherms and ectotherm .

aVGlobal climate change is one of important issue interesting to water resource expert in recent decade . Regarding global climate change , temperature and precipitation forecasting can have significant role in decision making and optimum use of water resource . Carried study in Iran , like other region of world , show increasing pattern in annual temperature . The present study wa designed to survey temperature increase in Khuzestan plain that is located in the southwest of Iran and it effect on potential evapotranspiration and water us in agriculture . The effect of temperature increase on agriculture water us in Khuzestan plain wa carried out based on analysis of annual temperature time series and theoretical base of evapotranspiration and crop water requirement . Study area includes vast part of Khuzestan province that ha 16 meteorological station in Behbahan , Ahvaz , Dezful and Karkheh region . Results of analysis of annual temperature time series showed 3.7 degree C increase in temperature for a 100-year period . Sensitive analysis of water requirement model showed 14 , 8,4 and 2.7 % change in potential evapotranspiration per 1 % change in temperature , wind speed , sun hour and relative humidity parameter , respectively . Increasing rate of potential evapotranspiration due to temperature increase wa 2.04 , 2.01 , 1.52 and 2.23 mm/year in Behbahan , Ahvaz , Dezful and Karkheh region , respectively . Also , the increasing rate of wheat water requirement due to temperature increase wa 723 , 508 , 339 and 488 ( m ( 3 ) /ha ) in study region during the next 50 year .

aVPublic policy response to global climate change present a classic problem of decision making under uncertainty . Theoretical work ha shown that explicitly accounting for uncertainty and learning in climate change can have a large impact on optimal policy , especially technology policy . However , theory also show that the specific impact of uncertainty are ambiguous . In this paper , we provide a framework that combine economics and decision analysis to implement probabilistic data on energy technology research and development ( R & D ) policy in response to global climate change . We find that , given a budget constraint , the composition of the optimal R & D portfolio is highly diversified and robust to risk in climate damage . The overall optimal investment into technical change , however , doe depend ( in a non-monotonic way ) on the risk in climate damage . Finally , we show that in order to properly value R & D , abatement must be included a a recourse decision . ( C ) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All right reserved .

aVAim Aquatic-terrestrial ecotones are vulnerable to climate change , and degradation of the emergent aquatic macrophyte zone would have severe ecological consequence for freshwater , wetland and terrestrial ecosystem . Our aim wa to uncover future change in boreal emergent aquatic macrophyte zone by modelling the occurrence and percentage cover of emergent aquatic vegetation under different climate scenario in Finland by the 2050s . Location Finland , northern Europe . Methods Data derived from different GIS source were used to estimate future emergent aquatic macrophyte distribution in all catchment in Finland ( 848 in total ) . We used generalized additive model ( GAM ) with a full stepwise selection algorithm and Akaike information criterion to explore the main environmental determinates ( climate and geomorphology ) of emergent aquatic macrophyte distribution , which were derived from the national subclass of CORINE land-cover classification . The accuracy of the distribution model ( GAMs ) wa cross-validated , using percentage of explained deviance and the area under the curve derived from the receiver-operating characteristic plot . Results Our result indicated that emergent aquatic macrophytes will expand their distribution northward from the current catchment and percentage cover will increase in all of the catchment in all climate scenario . Growing degree-days wa the primary determinant affecting distribution of emergent aquatic macrophytes . Inclusion of geomorphological variable clearly improved model performance in both model exercise compared with pure climate variable . Main conclusion Emergent aquatic macrophyte distribution will expand due to climate change . Many emergent aquatic plant specie have already expanded their distribution during the past decade , and this process will continue in the year 2051-80 . Emergent aquatic macrophytes pose an increasing overgrowth risk for sensitive macrophyte specie in boreal freshwater ecosystem , which should be acknowledged in management and conservation action . We conclude that prediction based on GIS data can provide useful 'first-filter ' estimate of change in aquatic-terrestrial ecotones .

aVThe impact of global climate change on the Basque coast and the pelagic system within the southeastern Bay of Biscay are reviewed . Climate projection under greenhouse gas emission scenario indicate that this area will experience change in climate throughout the 21st century , including warming of surface air ( especially heat wave episode ) , intensification of extreme daily rainfall ( 10 % ) , warming of the upper 100 m of the ocean layer ( 1.5 to 2.05 degree C ) , and sea level rise ( SLR ; 29 to 49 cm ) . Observations made in the bay throughout the 20th century for air temperature and mean sea level are in agreement with these projection . Trends in ocean-climatic historical observation within the area , including sea temperature , precipitation , upwelling/downwelling , turbulence and wave climate , are also reviewed . The main impact on the coast are expected to be from SLR , especially in low-lying area ( mostly urbanised ) within estuary . Sandy beach are also expected to undergo significant mean shoreline retreat of between 25 and 40 % of their width . As the sea level rise , the natural migration of saltmarshes and intertidal seagrass landward will be constrained , in most case , by existing anthropogenic fixed boundary . Empirical relationship between the distribution and dynamic of the long-term biological measure ( plankton , primary production , benthos , and fishery ) on the one hand , and ocean-climatic variability on the other , indicate that pelagic and coastal water ecosystem will be affected by ocean warming , increased stratification , shift in anomaly pattern and streamflow regime . The largest uncertainty are associated with the lack of down-scaled projection within the bay on ocean circulation , ocean-meteorological index , wave climate and ocean acidification .

aVStable isotope paleoaltimetry ha been widely used to estimate Cenozoic surface elevation of major orogens . The influence of global climate change on stable isotope paleoaltimetry is uncertain , with proposal that warming could cause either overestimate or underestimate of past surface elevation . In this study we increase atmospheric pCO ( 2 ) by two and four time in an isotope-tracking atmospheric general circulation model to investigate the effect of global warming on oxygen isotopic composition of precipitation ( delta ( 18 ) O ( p ) ) over the continent . As in other climate model , the response in the GENESIS version 3 model to global warming is an amplification of upper troposphere temperature through enhanced infrared absorption and a reduction in the surface to upper-level temperature gradient . Due to the temperature dependence of isotopic fractionation , vapor delta ( 18 ) O ( delta ( 18 ) O ( v ) ) follows suit , leading to a reduction in the surface to upper troposphere delta ( 18 ) O ( v ) gradient . In region of subsidence , including the major orogens and desert , downward mixing of ( 18 ) O-enriched vapor from the troposphere to the near surface further reduces the lapse rate of delta ( 18 ) O ( v ) . As a consequence of these effect , the isotopic composition of precipitation in high-elevation region , including the Tibetan Plateau , Rocky Mountains , European Alps , and Andean Plateau , increase by 3 % -6 % relative to that at low elevation . Neglect of this climate effect on high-elevation delta ( 18 ) O ( p ) ha likely led to underestimate of the surface elevation of Cenozoic orogens .

aVVariation in climatic temperature is frequently cited a playing a powerful role in driving host/pathogen dynamic , and a a consequence future pattern of disease are predicted to change owing to global warming . However , the preponderance of data is correlative and few quantitative test exist that dissect the relative effect of changing temperature on host and pathogen response . In this study , we experimentally tested the effect overwintering temperature had on the susceptibility of a vertebrate ectothermic host , the common toad Bufo bufo , to infection and mortality caused by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis ( Bd ) . We show that a 'poor ' ( warmer ) overwintering regime increase the probability of infection , supporting the concept that the dynamic of infection are altered by changing environmental temperature profile . We also show once established , the proliferation of Bd in the host wa better in toadlets that experienced a 'good ' ( colder ) winter . We find no relationship between survival and the different overwintering regime or any consistent deleterious influence of disease on survival . Instead , survival is overwhelmingly predicted by measurement of condition ( mass , mass lost over winter ) that were not determined by overwintering temperature . We conclude that the survival of a cohort of overwintering toadlets is primarily driven by pattern of growth during the larval period rather than winter temperature or infectious disease .

aVMerck suppressed data on harmful effect of it drug Vioxx , and Guidant suppressed data on electrical flaw in one of it heart-defibrillator model . Both case reveal how financial conflict of interest can skew biomedical research . Such conflict also occur in electric-utility-related research . Attempting to show that increased atomic energy can help address climate change , some industry advocate claim nuclear power is an inexpensive way to generate low-carbon electricity . Surveying 30 recent nuclear analysis , this paper show that industry-funded study appear to fall into conflict of interest and to illegitimately trim cost data in several main way . They exclude cost of full-liability insurance , underestimate interest rate and construction time by using `` overnight '' cost , and overestimate load factor and reactor lifetime . If these trimmed cost are included , nuclear-generated electricity can be shown roughly 6 time more expensive than most study claim . After answering four objection , the paper concludes that , although there may be reason to use reactor to address climate change , economics doe not appear to be one of them .

aVConvincing data now show that temperature are increasing , and that changing precipitation pattern are already affecting agriculture . Predicted future impact vary by region , but all are projected to suffer productivity decline by the late twenty-first century unless successful mitigation measure are implemented soon . Exacerbating the climate change challenge , doubling of overall crop productivity will be required by mid-century . Clearly , crop protection will become increasingly difficult a higher-yielding variety present a larger and more tempting target to all pest , and the pest themselves extend their range poleward and into other new geography owing to reduced winter kill and longer growing season . Fortunately , good progress on enhancing crop protection technology to meet these challenge is already being made , but the scope of this climatic provocation is such that complacency is not an option . Increased investment into new technology and adoption of new agricultural practice with improved adaptive and mitigation potential are both essential . ( C ) 2011 Society of Chemical Industry

aVDoes climate determine specie ' range ? Rapid rate of anthropogenic warming make this classic ecological question especially relevant . We ask whether climate control range limit by quantifying relationship between climatic variable ( precipitation , temperature ) and tree growth across the altitudinal range of six Pacific Northwestern conifer on Mt . Rainier , Washington , USA . Results for three specie ( Abies amabilis , Callitropsis nootkatensis , Tsuga mertensiana ) whose upper limit occur at treeline ( > 1600 m ) imply climatic control on upper range limit , with low growth in cold and high snowpack year . Annual growth wa synchronized among individual at upper limit for these high-elevation specie , further suggesting that stand-level effect such a climate constrain growth more strongly than local process . By contrast , at lower limit climatic effect on growth were weak for these high-elevation specie . Growth-climate relationship for three low-elevation specie ( Pseudotsuga menziesii , Thuja plicata , Tsuga heterophylla ) were not consistent with expectation of climatic control on upper limit , which are located within closed-canopy forest ( < 1200 m ) . Annual growth of these specie wa poorly synchronized among individual . Our result suggest that climate control altitudinal range limit at treeline , while local driver ( perhaps biotic interaction ) influence growth in closed-canopy forest . Climate-change-induced range shift in closed-canopy forest will therefore be difficult to predict accurately .

aVGlobal climate change will pose a wide range of challenge to freshwater resource , altering water quantity , quality , system operation , and imposing new governance complication . Among the many unresolved challenge is how to integrate information on future hydroclimatological condition into the politically complex system of transboundary water agreement , including formal treaty , international agreement , and transnational management institution . Yet , most treaty and international agreement lack important tool for dealing with current challenge , such a flood control and water quality , and they lack adequate mechanism for addressing changing social , economic or climate condition . There are various approach that can be incorporated into existing treaty to allow for flexibility in the face of climate change , including : ( 1 ) adjustable allocation strategy and water-quality standard ; ( 2 ) response strategy for extreme event ; ( 3 ) amendment and review procedure ; and ( 4 ) joint management institution . We offer some explicit example where specific strategy have been successfully implemented in way that both reduce the risk of political conflict over shared water and lessen vulnerability to climatic change .

aVReconstruction of past climate change and ecosystem response is important to correctly ass the impact of global warming . In this study , we provide a paleoenvironmental record of in-lake and catchment change in northern Poland during the Late Glacial and early Holocene using various biotic proxy ( pollen , macrofossils and Cladocera ) preserved in the lake sedimentary record . Chronology wa derived from palynological correlation with a well-dated pollen sequence from nearby-lying Lake Ostrowite and some well-dated event of vegetation history in Central Europe . Pollen analysis provided information on regional climate change affecting vegetation dynamic , whereas macrofossils supplied substantial information on the response of local flora and fauna to climatic , geomorphological and limnological change . Data were supplemented by analysis of Cladocera remains , which are of special importance because of their quick response to change in trophic condition and climate ( especially temperature ) . The bottom of the sediment core reflects an initial stage of the lake formed during the late Allerod . The Younger Dryas cooling apparently resulted in forest recession and presence of cold tolerant Cladocera specie . Due to amelioration of climate at the end of the Younger Dryas and melting of ice , the lake deepened . The beginning of the Holocene wa characterised by forest shrinkage and induced clear change in local flora and fauna community . The regional vegetation development deduced from the lake 's core is generally consistent with the vegetation history of central Europe . Due to the location of the site near the seashore ( oceanic climate and western wind ) , signal of warming came earlier than inland and in eastern Poland .

aVCarbon dioxide ( CO ( 2 ) ) emission from biomass combustion are traditionally assumed climate neutral if the bioenergy system is carbon ( C ) flux neutral , i.e . the CO ( 2 ) released from biofuel combustion approximately equal the amount of CO ( 2 ) sequestered in biomass . This convention , widely adopted in life cycle assessment ( LCA ) study of bioenergy system , underestimate the climate impact of bioenergy . Besides CO ( 2 ) emission from permanent C loss , CO ( 2 ) emission from C flux neutral system ( that is from temporary C loss ) also contribute to climate change : before being captured by biomass regrowth , CO ( 2 ) molecule spend time in the atmosphere and contribute to global warming . In this paper , a method to estimate the climate impact of CO ( 2 ) emission from biomass combustion is proposed . Our method us CO ( 2 ) impulse response function ( IRF ) from C cycle model in the elaboration of atmospheric decay function for biomass-derived CO ( 2 ) emission . Their contribution to global warming are then quantified with a unit-based index , the GWP ( bio ) . Since this index is expressed a a function of the rotation period of the biomass , our result can be applied to CO ( 2 ) emission from combustion of all the different biomass specie , from annual row crop to slower growing boreal forest .

aVAccumulation of greenhouse gas , especially carbon dioxide , is believed to be the key factor in global climate change . To develop effective way to remove CO ( 2 ) from the atmosphere , it is helpful to understand the mechanism of CO ( 2 ) solvation first . Here we investigate the thermodynamics of CO ( 2 ) hydration using quasi-chemical theory . Two approach for estimating hydration free energy are carried out . Both agree reasonably well with experimental measurement . Analysis of the free energy component reveals that the weak hydration free energy result from a balance of unfavorable molecular packing and favorable chemical association .

aV2 . In this study , we ass whether increased CO ( 2 ) quantitatively affect multiple defensive and nutritive trait in different leaf stage of cyanogenic wildtype lima bean plant ( Phaseolus lunatus ) , and whether plant response influence performance and choice behaviour of a natural insect herbivore , the Mexican bean beetle ( Epilachna varivestis ) . 3 . We cultivated lima bean plant in climate chamber at ambient , 500 , 700 , and 1000 ppm CO ( 2 ) and analysed cyanogenic precursor concentration ( nitrogen-based defence ) , total phenolic ( carbon-based defence ) , leaf mass per area ( LMA ; physical defence ) , and soluble protein ( nutritive parameter ) of three defined leaf age group . 4 . In young leaf , cyanide concentration wa the only parameter that quantitatively decreased in response to CO ( 2 ) treatment . In intermediate and mature leaf , cyanide and protein concentration decreased while total phenolic and LMA increased . 5 . Depending on leaf stage , CO ( 2 ) -mediated change in leaf trait significantly affected larval performance and choice behaviour of adult beetle . We observed a complete shift from highest herbivore damage in mature leaf under natural CO ( 2 ) to highest damage of young leaf under elevated CO ( 2 . ) Our study show that leaf stage is an essential factor when considering CO ( 2 ) -mediated change of plant defence against herbivore . Since in the long run preferred consumption of young leaf can strongly affect plant fitness , variable effect of elevated CO ( 2 ) on different leaf stage should receive highlighted attention in future research .

aVThe Newport Member of the Astoria Formation , exposed on the central Oregon coast , wa deposited at shallow marine depth during the Early Miocene global warming that led to the Middle Miocene Climate Optimum . This record thus provides the opportunity to examine a coastal environment over past warming and ask if the low oxygen condition observed in recent year on the modern Oregon shelf is a recent phenomenon or a repeated symptom of global warming . Although delta ( 18 ) O variation can be influenced by freshwater flux , if due to temperature delta ( 18 ) O value suggest 2.4-4.5 4.5 degree C of local warming during deposition of the Newport Member . Species of Buliminacea . Fursenkoina , and Nonionella , abundant in organic-rich , low-oxygen sediment in modern sea , increased in proportional abundance after warming began . In addition , the offset in delta ( 13 ) C value between epifaunal to shallow infaunal taxon and a deeper infaunal specie is greater in sediment with higher abundance of these taxon , further supporting increased organic carbon flux . An increase in laminated sediment coincident with these faunal and geochemical change suggests dysoxic condition accompanied the increase in organic carbon . Taken together , this multiproxy record suggests that high-organic , low-oxygen , environment developed in shallow water during Early Miocene warming , perhaps driven by similar upwelling mechanism thought to drive hypoxia on the modern Oregon coast .

aVAgainst the background of global climate change and increasing price of fossil fuel , the importance of producing sustainable renewable energy increase significantly . CO ( 2 ) -neutral energy generation using biomass or organic waste is an alternative option that deserves attention particularly in developing country . The aim of this paper is to provide an integrated framework for the preparation of feasibility study for the renewable energy sector there , considering technical , environmental , economic , socio-cultural , legal and institutional aspect which are particular applicable for developing country .

aVThe main objective of this study is to combine the environmental evaluation of a basic wood box used to store wine bottle by mean of the integration of two environmental methodology : a quantitative methodology known a life cycle assessment ( LCA ) and a qualitative methodology which is useful in integrating environmental aspect into design , that is , the design for the environment ( DfE ) . The LCA study cover the life cycle of wood box production from a cradle-to-gate perspective . A wood processing company located in Galicia ( NW , Spain ) wa analysed in detail , dividing the process chain into five stage : cogeneration unit , material assembling , painting , packaging and distribution to client . Abiotic depletion ( AD ) , acidification , eutrophication , global warming , ozone layer depletion ( OD ) , photochemical oxidant formation ( PO ) , human toxicity ( HT ) and toxicological impact category ( HT , fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity , marine aquatic ecotoxicity and terrestrial ecotoxicity ) were the impact category analysed in the LCA study . According to the environmental result , the assembling stage contributed more than 57 % to all impact category , followed by the cogeneration unit and packaging . Contributions from packaging are mainly due to transoceanic transport activity related to the rope distribution and wood-based material production . In addition , it is interesting to remark that all energy requirement were produced by on-site cogeneration boiler using a non-renewable fossil fuel . Several process were identified a hot spot in this study : medium density fibreboard ( MDF ) production ( with large contribution to ecotoxicity category ) , energy production ( with contribution to AD , GW and OD ) and finally , the transportation of jute fibre ( the main contributor to all the impact category ) . Concerning the result from the DfE , the proposed eco-design strategy were evaluated from a technological , economic and social point of view by an interdisciplinary team of researcher and enterprise 's worker . The result show that the strategy with more viability of improvement were : reduction of resource used , multifunctional design , substitution of MDF by plywood , substitution of jute fibre , alternative to the ink , optimization of energy requirement , transport alternative for the final product and input distribution and definition of a protocol for disassembling the product . The result obtained in this work allow forecasting the importance of the chosen raw material a well a their origin for the environmental burden associated with the wood-based box manufacture . Future work will focus on the manufacturing of a prototype eco-designed wood-based box .

aVWater is essential for human life and sustainable development . Most of the world agricultural production , hydroelectric power and water supply depend on the water cycle . Water is scarce and will be scarcer in future due to global warming and increasing population and technology . The purpose of this paper wa to compare two widely accepted energy recovery system used in seawater reverse osmosis ( SWRO ) desalination , which were with either pressure exchanger ( PX ) or turbine device , based on cost . Systems were compared based on their first cost and energy consumption cost for different water flow capacity . It wa concluded that the system with PX wa economically more advantageous than the system with turbine .

aVSea ice thickness play a critical role in global climate change , but it can not be measured directly from space . Alternatively , sea ice freeboard is measured and converted to sea ice thickness with assumption made for snow depth and snow/ice density . This paper investigates the relationship between snow-freeboard ( ice-freeboard plus snow ) and total thickness ( ice thickness plus snow ) and address the uncertainty that arise from the unknown snow depth and snow/ice density . A unique data set of coincident measurement of snow-freeboard and total thickness wa collected in the Arctic and Antarctic . Snow-freeboard wa determined by laser altimetry , and total thickness wa determined by electromagnetic induction with a helicopter-borne instrument . Obtained total thickness/snow-freeboard ratio range from 2 to 12 in the Arctic and from 2 to 8 in the Antarctic . The principal finding is that the ratio vary greatly within each region , and a fixed ratio per profile should not be used , a this can induce incorrect ice thickness . The ratio uncertainty can induce a relative thickness error of 5.4 % and 4.9 % in the first-year and multiyear ice mode . Additionally , the coincident measurement allow the calculation of snow depth that can be used to densify existing in situ measurement . To ass accuracy , calculated snow depth were compared to in situ measurement and agree within +/- 5 cm . This increase if measurement and calculation differ spatially . The method of deriving snow-freeboard from laser altimetry is briefly described , and the variability of the total thickness/snow-freeboard ratio is shown for one profile in the Lincoln Sea and one in the Weddell Sea .

aVThe future climate change projection are essentially based on coupled general circulation model ( CGCM ) simulation , which give a distinct global warming pattern with arctic winter amplification , an equilibrium land-sea warming contrast and an inter-hemispheric warming gradient . While these simulation are the most important tool of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) prediction , the conceptual understanding of these predicted structure of climate change and the cause of their uncertainty is very difficult to reach if only based on these highly complex CGCM simulation . In the study presented here we will introduce a very simple , globally resolved energy balance ( GREB ) model , which is capable of simulating the main characteristic of global warming . The model shall give a bridge between the strongly simplified energy balance model and the fully coupled 4-dimensional complex CGCMs . It provides a fast tool for the conceptual understanding and development of hypothesis for climate change study , which shall build a basis or starting point for more detailed study of observation and CGCM simulation . It is based on the surface energy balance by very simple representation of solar and thermal radiation , the atmospheric hydrological cycle , sensible turbulent heat flux , transport by the mean atmospheric circulation and heat exchange with the deeper ocean . Despite some limitation in the representation of the basic process , the model climate sensitivity and the spatial structure of the warming pattern are within the uncertainty of the IPCC model simulation . It is capable of simulating aspect of the arctic winter amplification , the equilibrium land-sea warming contrast and the inter-hemispheric warming gradient with good agreement to the IPCC model in amplitude and structure . The result give some insight into the understanding of the land-sea contrast and the polar amplification . The GREB model suggests that the regional inhomogeneous distribution of atmospheric water vapor and the non-linear sensitivity of the downward thermal radiation to change in the atmospheric water vapor concentration partly cause the land-sea contrast and may also contribute to the polar amplification . The combination of these characteristic cause , in general , dry and cold region to warm more than other region .

aVClimate warming challenge our approach to building system of protected area because it is likely to drive accelerating shift in specie distribution , and the projection of those future specie distribution are uncertain . There are several important source of uncertainty intrinsic to using specie occurrence projection for reserve system design including uncertainty in the number of occurrence captured by any reserve selection solution , and uncertainty arising from the different approach used to fit predictive model . Here we used the present and future predicted distribution of Iberian herptiles to analyze how dynamic and uncertainty in specie distribution may affect decision about resource allocation for conservation in space and time . We identified priority area maximizing coverage of current and future ( 2020 and 2080 ) predicted distribution of 65 specie , under `` Mild '' and `` Severe '' uncertainty . Next , we applied a return-on-investment analysis to quantify and make explicit trade-off between investing in area selected when optimizing for different time and with different uncertainty level . Areas identified a important for conservation in every time frame and uncertainty level were the one considered to be robust climate adaptation investment , and included chiefly already protected area . Areas identified only under `` Mild '' uncertainty were considered good candidate for investment if extra resource are available and were mainly located in northern Iberia . However , area selected only in the `` Severe '' uncertainty case should not be completely disregarded a they may become climatic refugia for some specie . Our study provides an objective methodology to deliver `` no regret '' conservation investment . ( C ) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVIn an environment of uncertain climatic change , there is an urgent need to develop robust reserve network , i.e. , network that conserve specie across multiple climatic future . Using climatic envelope based on multiple future climatic scenario , we first estimate the impact that these scenario might have on the distribution of 63 native tree specie in the Province of Ontario . Next , an optimization model is applied to expand an existing system of reserve in this province by determining the minimum number of optimal location for additional reserve both with and without the need for migration . The optimization model formulated differs from previous work in that it meet the need for present and future distribution to occur in the same reserve and accommodates multiple differing climate change scenario rather than a single scenario . The reserve selection approach described here can be applied anywhere that specie ' distribution and environmental grid are available . Although this approach is designed to produce a robust solution to the uncertainty over future climatic scenario , it doe not eliminate these uncertainty because the proposed solution inherit the uncertainty of the global climate change model .

aVOcean acidification , which like global warming is an outcome of anthropogenic CO ( 2 ) emission , severely impact marine calcifying organism , especially those living in coral reef ecosystem . However , knowledge about the response of reef calcifiers to ocean acidification is quite limited , although coral response are known to be generally negative . In a culture experiment with two algal symbiont-bearing , reef-dwelling foraminifer , Amphisorus kudakajimensis and Calcarina gaudichaudii , in seawater under five different pCO ( 2 ) condition , 245 , 375 , 588 , 763 and 907 mu atm , maintained with a precise pCO ( 2 ) -controlling technique , net calcification of A. kudakajimensis wa reduced under higher pCO ( 2 ) , whereas calcification of C. gaudichaudii generally increased with increased pCO ( 2 ) . In another culture experiment conducted in seawater in which bicarbonate ion concentration were varied under a constant carbonate ion concentration , calcification wa not significantly different between treatment in Amphisorus hemprichii , a specie closely related to A. kudakajimensis , or in C. gaudichaudii . From these result , we concluded that carbonate ion and CO ( 2 ) were the carbonate specie that most affected growth of Amphisorus and Calcarina , respectively . The opposite response of these two foraminifer genus probably reflect different sensitivity to these carbonate specie , which may be due to their different symbiotic algae .

aVSoil respiration ( R ( s ) ) is overwhelmingly the sum of autotrophic respiration ( R ( a ) , root and rhizosphere ) and heterotrophic respiration ( R ( h ) , microbe and soil fauna ) . Separating R ( s ) into R ( a ) and R ( h ) component is a major challenge but necessary for understanding the implication of environmental change on soil C cycling and sequestration . In this study , a trenching method wa employed to partition R ( s ) source in Chinese fir plantation in Southern China . Soil CO ( 2 ) efflux ( FCO ( 2 ) ) rate were measured using an infrared gas analyser system with soil chamber at the trenched and untrenched ( Control ) plot from January 2007 to December 2008 . Soil temperature ( T ( soil ) ) and soil water content ( W ( soil ) ) were also measured at the plot during the study period . The result showed that the mean soil FCO ( 2 ) rate from trenched plot ( 0.88 +/- 0.12 mu mol m ( -2 ) s ( -1 ) , mean +/- s.e . ) wa significantly lower than that from untrenched plot ( 1.22 +/- 0.18 mu mol m ( -2 ) s ( -1 ) ) ( P < 0.001 ) during the study period . Compared with R ( a ) , R ( h ) made a major contribution to annual flux ofRs in Chinese fir forest . The relative proportion of R ( h ) to R ( s ) averaged 76 and 69 % in 2007 and 2008 , respectively . The seasonal change of R ( a ) to R ( s ) ratio ranged from 13 to 56 % with a mean of 33 % . The annual mean R ( s ) wa 455 +/- 249 gCm ( -2 ) year ( -1 ) in the study site for the study period , of which R ( h ) and R ( a ) were 330 +/- 219 and 125 +/- 65 gCm ( -2 ) year ( -1 ) , respectively . Both R ( s ) and R ( h ) wa strongly correlated with T ( soil ) at a 5-cm depth , while R ( a ) had no relationship with T ( soil ) . Temporal variation in W ( soil ) had little effect on R ( s ) and R ( h ) . The result indicated that the flux of R ( a ) and R ( h ) were controlled by different factor and the microbial community , compared with root , were likely more sensitive to global warming in affecting soil C flux in Chinese fir ecosystem in subtropical region .

aVThe well established excellent correlation between low-level cloud and primary cosmic ray intensity , which act a nucleus for cloud condensation , clearly show that a decrease in primary cosmic ray intensity result in lesser low cloud cover . Reduced albedo radiation reflected back into space , due to lesser low cloud cover , result in an increase in the surface temperature on the earth . Extrapolation of the intensity of galactic cosmic radiation using ( 10 ) Be measurement in deep polar ice a the proxy , clearly show that the primary cosmic ray intensity ha decreased by 9 % during the last 150 year , due to the continuing increase in solar activity . We present evidence to show that the radiative forcing component due to the decrease in primary cosmic ray intensity during the last 150 year is 1.1 Wm ( -2 ) , which is about 60 % of that due to CO ( 2 ) increase . We conclude that the future prediction of global warming presented by IPCC4 requires a relook to take into the effect due to long-term change in the galactic cosmic ray intensity .

aVOceanic uptake of carbon dioxide substantially reduces the rate at which anthropogenic carbon accumulates in the atmosphere ( 1 ) , slowing global climate change . Some study suggest that the rate at which the ocean take up carbon ha significantly decreased in recent year ( 2-8 ) . Others suggest that decadal variability confounds the detection of long-term trend ( 9-11 ) . Here , we examine trend in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the surface water of three large biogeographic region in the North Atlantic , using observational data collected between 1981 and 2009 . We compare these oceanic observation with trend in atmospheric carbon dioxide level , taken from a global observational network . We show that trend in oceanic carbon dioxide concentration are variable on a decadal timescale , often diverging from trend in atmospheric carbon dioxide . However , when the entire 29-year period is considered , oceanic trend converge with atmospheric trend in all three region ; it take 25 year for this long-term trend to emerge and overcome the influence of decadal-scale variability . Furthermore , in the southernmost biome , the data suggest that warming-driven by a multidecadal climate oscillation and anthropogenic forcing ( 12,13 ) -has started to reduce oceanic uptake of carbon in recent year .

aVCoral reef ecosystem are among the most biologically diverse ecosystem on the planet . In addition to their value in term of biodiversity , coral reef provide food and resource for over 500 million people . Despite their importance , coral reef are declining at a rapid rate ( 1-2 % per year ) a a result of a range of local ( e.g. , overexploitation of fishery , declining water quality ) and global ( e.g. , global warming and ocean acidification ) driver . Extensive experimental and field evidence suggests that atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration of 450 ppm will lead to the loss of coral-dominated reef system , with the prospect that dangerous level of atmospheric carbon dioxide for coral reef were exceeded in 1979 when mass coral bleaching wa reported for the first time . The exact response of coral reef remains uncertain although it is highly unlikely that coral-dominated reef system will be present in future ocean at the current rate of warming and acidification of the world 's tropical ocean . The loss of these important coastal ecosystem will diminish the resource available to hundred of million of people along tropical coastline . Understanding the impact on people and industry is an imperative if we are to devise effective system by which tropical coastal community are to adapt to rapidly changing tropical coastal environment . Our current understanding of these important issue , however , is in a relatively undeveloped state and must be a priority of future research .

aVWhile it ha been known that toxic and non-toxic Microcystis coexist in lake and their relative proportion vary depending on environmental factor , the main driving force for such variation is still unclear . Therefore , this study attempted to verify the environmental factor related to the dynamic of the abundance of toxic and non-toxic Microcystis in the Daechung Reservoir , Korea . Water sample were collected at weekly interval from June to October , 2006 . Microcystis wa a dominant cyanobacterial genus during this period . The proportion of toxic Microcystis genotype wa quantified using a real-time PCR with 2 primer set for the cpcBA-IGS and mcyJ gene to determine the total Microcystis and potentially toxic genotype , respectively . Cell density of toxic and non-toxic Microcystis were strongly related , implying that their growth may be governed by the same environmental factor . Although nontoxic Microcystis wa generally dominant over potentially toxic genotype , the toxic proportion briefly predominated during the Microcystis bloom . While the phosphorus concentration wa the fundamental regulating factor for cyanobacterial proliferation , the proportion change of potentially toxic Microcystis genotype were more closely related with the water temperature ( P < 0.01 ) , suggesting that eutrophication together with global warming could lead to more frequent toxic bloom .

Alterations of biotic pattern caused by GCC have usually been predicted on the scale of taxonomically recognized morphospecies ( 1 ) . However , the effect of climate change at the most fundamental level of biodiversity-intraspecific genetic diversity-remain elusive ( 4 ) . Here we show that the use of morphospecies-based assessment of GCC effect will result in underestimation of the true scale of biodiversity loss . Species distribution modelling and assessment of mitochondrial DNA variability in nine montane aquatic insect specie in Europe indicate that future range contraction will be accompanied by severe loss of cryptic evolutionary lineage and genetic diversity within these lineage . These loss greatly exceed those at the scale of morphospecies . We also document that the extent of range reduction may be a useful proxy when predicting loss of genetic diversity . Our result demonstrate that intraspecific pattern of genetic diversity should be considered when estimating the effect of climate change on biodiversity .

aVWe discus the current status of waste to power generation ( WPG ) in Japan and various scenario involving indirect reduction of carbon dioxide emission by WPG . The number of WPG facility domestically a of 2005 wa 286 . Power generation capacity attained 1,515 MW and power generation 7,050 GWh/year . This amount substitute energy otherwise acquired from natural resource such a fossil fuel in thermal power plant . If the basic unit of carbon dioxide is 0.555 kg-CO ( 2 ) /kWh , then the corresponding carbon dioxide emission reduction is calculated to be 3.9 million ton , equivalent to 26.7 % of the 14.6 million ton emitted by municipal solid waste incinerator ( MSWI ) in 2005 . Using various existing technological option , the power generation efficiency could reach more than 20 % in MSWI facility with capacity of 300 tons/day , although present efficiency is only 12.0 % . If about 85 % of MSW were incinerated in MSWI with power generation efficiency of 20 % a a feasible assumption , the total power generation and the corresponding carbon dioxide reduction would be 16,540 GWh/year and 9.18 million ton , respectively , equivalent to 62.7 % of the carbon dioxide emitted by MSWI . Also , the ratio of the additional reduction of carbon dioxide emission by WPG to the total additional reduction ( 20,000 ktons/year ) in Japan during the first commitment period would be 26.3 % , suggesting that promotion of WPG in MSWI is an effective option for prevention of global warming .

aVA scientific challenge is to ass the role of Deccan volcanism in the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary ( KTB ) mass extinction . Here we report on the stratigraphy and biologic effect of Deccan volcanism in eleven deep well from the Krishna-Godavari ( K-G ) Basin , Andhra Pradesh , India . In these well , two phase of Deccan volcanism record the world 's largest and longest lava mega-flows interbedded in marine sediment in the K-G Basin about 1500 km from the main Deccan volcanic province . The main phase-2 eruption ( similar to 80 % of total Deccan Traps ) began in C29r and ended at or near the KTB , an interval that span planktic foraminiferal zone CF1-CF2 and most of the nannofossil Micula prinsii zone , and is correlative with the rapid global warming and subsequent cooling near the end of the Maastrichtian . The mass extinction began in phase-2 preceding the first of four mega-flows . Planktic foraminifera suffered a 50 % drop in specie richness . Survivors suffered another 50 % drop after the first mega-flow , leaving just 7 to 8 survivor specie . No recovery occurred between the next three mega-flows and the mass extinction wa complete with the last phase-2 mega-flow at the KTB . The mass extinction wa likely the consequence of rapid and massive volcanic CO ( 2 ) and SO ( 2 ) gas emission , leading to high continental weathering rate , global warming , cooling , acid rain , ocean acidification and a carbon crisis in the marine environment . Deccan volcanism phase-3 began in the early Danian near the C29R/C29n boundary correlative with the planktic foraminiferal zone P1a/P1b boundary and account for similar to 14 % of the total volume of Deccan eruption , including four of Earth 's longest and largest mega-flows . No major faunal change are observed in the intertrappeans of zone P1b , which suggests that environmental condition remained tolerable , volcanic eruption were le intense and/or separated by longer time interval thus preventing runaway effect . Alternatively , early Danian assemblage evolved in adaptation to high-stress condition in the aftermath of the mass extinction and therefore survived phase-3 volcanism . Full marine biotic recovery did not occur until after Deccan phase-3 . These data suggest that the catastrophic effect of phase-2 Deccan volcanism upon the Cretaceous planktic foraminifera were a function of both the rapid and massive volcanic eruption and the highly specialized faunal assemblage prone to extinction in a changing environment . Data from the K-G Basin indicates that Deccan phase-2 alone could have caused the KTB mass extinction and that impact may have had secondary effect .

aVThe Hindu Kush-Himalayan ( HKH ) region hold the largest mass of ice in Central Asia and is highly vulnerable to global climate change , experiencing significant warming ( 0.21 +/- 0.08 degree C/decade ) over the past few decade . Accurate monitoring of the timing and duration of snowmelt across the HKH region is important , a this region is expected to experience further warming in response to increased greenhouse gas forcing . Despite the many advantage and application of satellite-derived radar scatterometer data shown for capturing ice and snow melt dynamic at high latitude , similar comprehensive freeze/thaw detection study at lower latitude ( including the HKH region ) are still absent from the scientific literature . A comprehensive freeze/thaw detection study is utilized on perennial snow/ice and seasonal snow cover for the first time in the Himalayan and Karakoram region . A dynamic threshold-based method is applied to enhanced QuikSCAT Ku-band backscatter observation from 2000 to 2008 that ( a ) provides spatial map of the timing of melt , freeze , and melt season duration , and ( b ) emphasizes regional variability in freeze/thaw dynamic . The resulting average melt duration for 2000-2008 are 161 +/- 11 day ( early May-mid-October ) for the eastern Himalayas , 130 +/- 16 day ( late May-early October ) for the central Himalayas , 124 +/- 13 day ( mid-May-mid-September ) for the western Himalayas , and 124 +/- 12 day ( late May-late September ) for the Karakoram region . The eastern Himalayan region ha on average an earlier melt onset , a later freeze-up , and therefore a longer melt season ( similar to 5 week ) relative to the central and western Himalayan and the Karakoram region . Snowmelt dynamic exhibit regional and interannual variability with clear connection to terrain feature , in particular elevation and aspect . With respect to ongoing controversy surrounding melt in the Himalayan region , this study provides an overall perspective of regional difference in melt onset , freeze-up , and melt duration that have important implication for glaciological and hydrological process across the HKH region .

aVAs temperature increase the metabolic rate , the effect of warming on animal will also enhance animal-driven nutrient cycling with important consequence on ecosystem dynamic . We tested the effect of increased temperature ( 15 and 20 degree C , optimal and suboptimal temperature , respectively ) on metabolic rate of the shredder larva Sericostoma vittatum fed on three diet , Alnus glutinosa ( L. ) Gaertn. , Eucalyptus globulus Labill . and Quercus robur L. We measured P and N content in leaf , faeces and excreta and calculated C , N , and P assimilation efficiency , and mass balance . Carbon assimilation efficiency ( AE ) wa reduced at 20 degree C when larva fed on Q. robur ; nitrogen-AE wa reduced at 20 degree C in all diet and phosphorus-AE wa not affected by temperature . Larvae achieved a net N gain in all treatment , however , increased temperature had a negative effect on N incorporation into body tissue . The mass balance of P wa negatively affected by temperature ; larva fed on Q. robur and on E. globulus had null balance at 15 degree C and negative at 20 degree C. Our result showed that high temperature increased nutrient excretion and affected N : P ratio in excreta , thus change in temperature may have severe consequence on larval mediated leaf litter processing and nutrient cycling . However , the type of diet seemed to modulate the way temperature affect larval metabolism regarding excretion rate and assimilation efficiency . The extent to which optimal-suboptimal temperature variation will alter detritivore metabolism performance , internal nutrient balance and hence , cycling of element in the environment seems crucial under global warming scenario .

aVThis study investigates the change in winter cold extreme event over East Asia in the present and future climate . Two distinct term to indicate cold extreme event are analyzed : `` cold day , '' which describes a temperature below a certain threshold value ( e. g. , simply cold weather ) , and `` cold surge , '' which describes an abrupt temperature drop ( e. g. , relatively colder weather than a previous day ) . We analyze both observation and long-term climate simulation from 13 atmospheric and oceanic coupled global climate model ( CGCMs ) . The geographical distribution of sea level pressure corresponding to a cold day ( cold surge ) is represented by a dipole ( wave train ) feature . Although cold day and cold surge show similar pattern of surface air temperature , they are induced by the out-of-phase sea level pressure . From the result of our analysis of a series of future projection for the mid and late twenty-first century using the 13 CGCMs , cold day occurrence clearly decrease with an increasing mean temperature ( a correlation coefficient of -0.49 ) , but the correlation between cold surge occurrence and the mean temperature is insignificant ( a correlation coefficient of 0.08 ) , which is supported by the same result in recent observation period ( 1980-2006 ) . Thus , it is anticipated that cold surge occurrence will remain frequent even in future warmer climate . This deduction is based on the future projection in which the change in the day-to-day temperature variability is insignificant , although the mean temperature show significant increase . The present result suggest that living thing in the future , having acclimatized to a warmer climate , would suffer the strong impact of cold surge , and hence the issue of vulnerability to cold surge should be treated seriously in the future .

aVHFO-1234yf ( Hydrofluoro-Olefin ) is a new , low global warming refrigerant developed for automotive air-conditioning ( A/C ) system [ Nielsen et al. , Chem Phys Lett 439 ( 2007 ) , 18-22 ] . It wa developed to replace R-134a , which is being phased out in the European Union because of it high global warming potential ( IPCC , Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report Climate Change 2007 : Synthesis Report , 2007 ) . HFO-1234yf is highly energy efficient , exhibit low toxicity , and can be potentially used in direct expansion automotive A/C system with minimal design modification . Significant work ha been previously completed to confirm the mild flammability characteristic of HFO-1234yf To understand the impact of accidental release of HFO-1234yf into a garage environment , computational fluid dynamic ( CFD ) modeling wa used to simulate release of HFO-1234yf under various A/C line rupture scenario . In panicular ; release were simulated using a leak source in . a calm open area , a room with no forced ventilation and the same space but impinging on a flat plate . The refrigerant concentration wa determined a function of distance ( x , y , and z direction ) from the leak point during leak event . The size and shape of the portion of the refrigerant plume above the lower flammability limit wa also determined . This work enforces the benefit of using the inherently safer practice of minimization of refrigerant quantity . This article will review CID modeling result for given refrigerant leak scenario .

aVThe recent failure of Copenhagen negotiation show that concrete action are needed to create the condition for a consensus over global emission reduction policy . A wide coalition of country in international climate change agreement could be facilitated by the perceived fairness of rich and poor country of the abatement sharing at international level . In this paper I use two popular climate change integrated assessment model to investigate the path and decompose component and source of future inequality in the emission distribution . Results prove to be consistent with previous empirical study and robust to model comparison and show that gap in GDP across world region will still play a crucial role in explaining different country contribution to global warming .

aVFloristically , Taiwan is a very rich island due to her varied geography , topography and habitat . Through extended historical research involving past and present botanical inventory of the central mountain , particularly of the Hehuanshan area of Taiwan , we are now able to examine the floristic composition of four elevation zone , 2,000-2,500 m , 2,500-3,000 m , 3,000-3,500 m , and 3,500-3,950 m. We selected four study site , namely Shinjenkan ( SJK ) at 2,250-2,585 m , Shihmenshan ( SMS ) at 3,000 m , Hehuan East Peak ( HEP ) at : 3,401 m , and Hehuan Major Peak ( HMP ) at 3,408 m , and determined their alpha , beta , and gamma diversity along with their Simpson '' s diversity index . Our result clearly showed that the specie richness ( alpha diversity ) wa significantly high and decreased a the altitude increased . Coincidently , Simpson 's diversity index at 2,250 m wa significantly high at 0.85 , drastically decreased to 0.17 at 3,145 m , and continued to decrease to 0.10 at both site at 3408 m. On the other hand , by comparing plant distribution data collected over a century for the Hehuanshan , Alishan and Yushan area , we were able to predict that plant would migrate mostly from a lower to a higher elevation when the global temperature increase . For instance , in the Hehuanshan area , 16 specie would move towards higher elevation and seven specie would remain in their original zone . In the Alishan area , seven specie would migrate and four would remain in their original zone , and in Yushan , 15 specie would migrate out of their zone and five would remain . Of all of the specie , at least six risk extinction , since their expected migration would take them far beyond the limit of the land available above 3,950 m. It is concluded that the alpine vegetation will be redistributed , many plant specie will move towards a higher elevation and , eventually , at least six plant specie ( Anaphalis morrisonicola , Artemisia morrisonensis , Swertia randaiensis , Hypericum nagasawai , Angelica morrisonicola , and Cirsium arisanensis ) will become extinct .

aVAgricultural management practice that enhance C sequestration , reduce greenhouse gas emission ( nitrous oxide [ N ( 2 ) O ] , methane [ CH ( 4 ) ] , and carbon dioxide [ CO ( 2 ) ] ) , and promote productivity are needed to mitigate global warming without sacrificing food production . The objective of the study were to compare productivity , greenhouse gas emission , and change in soil C over time and to ass whether global warming potential and global warming potential per unit biomass produced were reduced through combined mitigation strategy when implemented in the northern U.S. Corn Belt . The system compared were ( i ) business a usual ( BAU ) ; ( ii ) maximum C sequestration ( MAXC ) ; and ( iii ) optimum greenhouse gas benefit ( OGGB ) . Biomass production , greenhouse gas flux , change in total and organic soil C , and global warming potential were compared among the three system . Soil organic C accumulated only in the surface 0 to 5 cm . Three-year average emission of N ( 2 ) O and CH ( 4 ) wa similar among all management system . When integrated from planting to planting , N ( 2 ) O emission wa similar for MAXC and OGGB system , although only MAXC wa fertilized . Overall , the three system had similar global warming potential based on 4-yr change in soil organic C , but average rotation biomass wa le in the OGGB system . Global warming potential per dry crop yield wa the least for the MAXC system and the most for OGGB system . This suggests management practice designed to reduce global warming potential can be achieved without a loss of productivity . For example , MAXC system over time may provide sufficient soil C sequestration to off set associated greenhouse gas emission .

aVRuminant livestock are responsible for production of a portion of greenhouse gas , particularly methane ( 61 Tg/yr ) which is believed to contribute to global warming and climate change . Methane is an end product of fermentation of plant material by the microbial ecosystem in the rumen . Methanogenesis is undertaken by methanogenic archaea and is a mechanism by which H ( 2 ) is removed from fermentation in order to regenerate biochemical co-factors such a NAD+ . The microbial ecosystem is very complex and involves thousand of specie of bacteria ( 10 ( 10 ) -10 ( 11 ) cells/ml ) , archaea ( 10 ( 7 ) -10 ( 9 ) cells/ml ) , protozoa ( 10 ( 4 ) -10 ( 6 ) cells/ml ) , fungi ( 10 ( 3 ) -10 ( 6 ) cells/ml ) , and virus ( 10 ( 9 ) -10 ( 10 ) cells/ml ) , which interact with the feed , their host and each other . This ecosystem is relatively poorly understood , particularly inter-species interaction and interaction with the host . Less than 15 % of the microbial specie in the gastrointestinal tract have been cultured and characterised . However , knowledge of this ecosystem is accumulating , particularly with the advent of molecular biology and culture independent technology . New high throughput sequencing methodology , such a pyrosequencing , will greatly improve the rate of knowledge acquisition and technique such a Stable Isotope Probing will enhance our ability to understand specie inter-relationships . While we can expect an increase in our knowledge of this complex ecosystem , and an improved ability to predictably lower CH ( 4 ) emission , example of successful reduction already exist , including use of feed ( e.g. , cereal grain ) and chemical additive ( e.g. , 2-bromo-ethane sulfonate , bromochloromethane ) . Achieving meaningful reduction in CH ( 4 ) emission may be possible with advance in our knowledge of the intricacy of this complex ecosystem .

aVRecord low austral winter rainfall total over southwest Western Australia ( SWWA ) in 2010 saw a continuation of the multidecade-long winter drought plaguing the region . During this season , the highest recorded positive Southern Annular Mode ( SAM ) value wa measured , adding weight to an association of a positive SAM with anomalously low SWWA winter rainfall ( SWR ) , and vice-versa . However , such a SAM-SWR teleconnection ha been recently questioned . Using observational data in the post-1979 satellite era , it is shown that such a SAM influence doe exist . This coherence is confirmed with 1150 year of modelled 20th century SWR anomaly and SAM value from 23 climate model , showing that a nonlinear impact operates : the influence from a negative SAM is greater than that from a positive SAM . This explains why a small positive shift in the SAM can cause a large SWR reduction , a ha been observed . A further test show that model with a greater positive SAM trend systematically produce a greater future SWR reduction . As all climate model project an increase in the SAM these result suggest that a global warming continues unabated , SWWA winter drought will be more persistent a atmospheric condition become more unfavourable for drought-breaking rain .

aVThe upcoming ban on battery cage in the European Union is expected to cause a shift in husbandry system from predominantly battery cage to enriched cage and loose housing system , such a barn , free range and organic system . To gain insight into ecological and economic consequence of such a ban , we quantified the ecological and economic performance of the most commonly used egg production system in the Netherlands , and identified which parameter explain difference in performance . We included the conventional battery cage system and the following loose housing system : single and multi-tiered barn system , single and multi-tiered free range system , and single and multi-tiered organic system . Ecological indicator used were deduced from a life cycle assessment , and were : global warming potential , energy use , land occupation , fossil phosphorus use , acidification potential , nitrogen and phosphorus deficit , and nitrogen and phosphorus surplus , each expressed per kg of egg . Economic indicator used wa net farm income per full time employee . Based on our ecological evaluation of Dutch egg production system , we predict that a ban on battery cage in the European Union will increase global warming potential , land occupation and acidification potential per kg of egg produced , whereas the effect on energy use , fossil phosphorus use , nitrogen and phosphorus deficit , and nitrogen and phosphorus surplus depends on relative importance of different loose housing system . Of all loose housing system , organic system had lowest global warming potential , energy use , fossil phosphorus use , and nitrogen and phosphorus surplus , whereas land occupation and nitrogen and phosphorus deficit wa lowest for barn system . Acidification potential wa lowest for a multi-tiered barn system . Differences in LCA result among production system can be explained mainly by difference ; in feed conversion , in parameter that determine ecological impact per kg feed ingredient ( e.g. , crop yield per ha ; number field operation , type and amount of fertilization ) , in drying of grain , in transport of concentrate and manure , in type of hen house and in N excretion per hen per year . Free range system had highest net farm income , followed by organic system . Multi-tiered system had a higher net farm income than single-tiered system . In case difference among egg and cost price of different system do not change after a ban on the battery cage , multitiered free range and organic system are economically most favourable .

aVBackground : Dengue is a leading cause of severe illness and hospitalization in Vietnam . This study sought to elucidate the linkage between climate factor , mosquito index and dengue incidence . Methods : Monthly data on dengue case and mosquito larval index were ascertained between 2004 and 2008 in the Dak Lak province ( Vietnam ) . Temperature , sunshine , rainfall and humidity were also recorded a monthly average . The association between these ecological factor and dengue wa assessed by the Poisson regression model with adjustment for seasonality . Results : During the study period , 3,502 case of dengue fever were reported . Approximately 72 % of case were reported from July to October . After adjusting for seasonality , the incidence of dengue fever wa significantly associated with the following factor : higher household index ( risk ratio [ RR ] : 1.66 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 1.62-1.70 per 5 % increase ) , higher container index ( RR : 1.78 ; 95 % CI : 1.73-1.83 per 5 % increase ) , and higher Breteau index ( RR : 1.57 ; 95 % CI : 1.53-1.60 per 5 unit increase ) . The risk of dengue wa also associated with elevated temperature ( RR : 1.39 ; 95 % CI : 1.25-1.55 per 2 degree C increase ) , higher humidity ( RR : 1.59 ; 95 % CI : 1.51-1.67 per 5 % increase ) , and higher rainfall ( RR : 1.13 ; 95 % CI : 1.21-1.74 per 50 mm increase ) . The risk of dengue wa inversely associated with duration of sunshine , the number of dengue case being lower a the sunshine increase ( RR : 0.76 ; 95 % CI : 0.73-0.79 per 50 hour increase ) . Conclusions : These data suggest that index of mosquito and climate factor are main determinant of dengue fever in Vietnam . This finding suggests that the global climate change will likely increase the burden of dengue fever infection in Vietnam , and that intensified surveillance and control of mosquito during high temperature and rainfall season may be an important strategy for containing the burden of dengue fever .

aVThis study wa conducted to evaluate the causality between energy consumption , GDP growth and carbon emission for eight Asia-Pacific country from 1971 to 2005 using the panel data . The result indicate that there are long-run equilibrium relationship between these variable . Additionally , causality from energy consumption to CO ( 2 ) emission wa observed generally , but there were some opposite relationship also . Parameter estimation of the panel data model indicate that there are great difference in the carbon emission , the efficiency of energy use , carbon emission of unit GDP and unit energy consumption between developed and developing country . The base carbon emission , per caput energy consumption and efficiency of energy use in developing country are far lower than in developed country ; however , the CO ( 2 ) emission per unit of energy use is higher . Although developing country may reduce their CO ( 2 ) emission per unit energy use , total energy consumption will rise rapidly with economic development . Thus , developing country must determine how to undergo economic growth while conserving energy and reducing emission . To respond to global climate change , it is necessary to develop innovative technology for energy use , transform the energy structure and conduct the clean development mechanism .

aVBackgrounds Global warming ha increased concern about the synergistic or interactive effect of temperature and air pollution on human health . The aim of this study wa to examine the effect of change in season and temperature on mortality associated with air pollution in Seoul , Korea , from June 1999 to December 2007 . Methods We used Poisson regression model with natural cubic spline . The effect of modification wa explored with two model : a time-varying coefficient model and a temperature-stratified model . Results In the summer season with high temperature , we observed a considerable increase in the association between mortality and air pollution . The elevated risk wa pronounced particularly in the effect of SO ( 2 ) , and the increase of RR on non-accidental mortality wa 0.83 % ( 95 % CI 0.42 to 1.25 ) at high temperature ( > = 26.2 degree C ) whereas the overall estimate wa 0.21 % ( 95 % CI 0.07 to 0.36 ) per 0.5 ppb increment of SO ( 2 ) . Those aged 65 y and over generally showed a higher risk of mortality . At extremely high temperature , the age group 85 y and older wa especially vulnerable to air pollution . In a two-pollutant model , the significant effect of SO ( 2 ) at high temperature ( > = 26.2 degree C ) wa not confounded by adjusting for other pollutant and the effect of CO at temperature of 19.1-26.2 degree C remained largely unchanged by adjusting for other pollutant . The dominant adverse effect of SO ( 2 ) at high temperature might be explained by an increase in concentration of sulfate by enhanced photochemical reaction , whereas at milder temperature without vigorous photochemical activity the effect of CO may predominate in increasing mortality . Conclusions Season and temperature strongly modified the adverse effect of air pollution , which implicates that an increase in the number of hot summer day by global warming may alter the health effect of air pollution .

aVSeasonal foraging activity of termite depends principally on air temperature which are increasing in recent year due to global warming . To examine the seasonal foraging activity of termite , a walking belt transects of 1 m wide wa randomly laid every two week in four plot . Inside the frame of each plot , 100 wood log were examined for the presence or absence of termite during one year . To determine the effect of temperature on termite foraging activity , the relation between the monthly mean temperature ( maximum and minimum ) and the termite foraging activity were analyzed . The effect of climate change on this activity wa analyzed by comparing our result with a previous study . In our study period , termite foraged throughout all the year . Their activity were low ( but occurred ) in winter . Foraging increased significantly in summer , reaching a maximum in autumn ( especially for Odontoterms formosanus ) . Odontotermes specie were the most active termite in our study site . The specie of this genus attacked 23 % of the examined wood log . Odontotermes dimorphus wa also recorded for the first time in Hangzhou . The foraging activity of termite wa positively correlated with air temperature . The occurrence of termite activity in winter and the presence of O. dimorphus in our study site could be a result of global warming . We suggest that any management strategy against termite in these site should be carried out at the period of high foraging activity .

aVGlobal warming is likely to increase spring temperature in region with a cool climate . To examine the effect of this change on rice productivity , we exposed rice plant to a higher ( by +2.7 to +2.8 degree C ) water temperature ( T ( w ) ) during the vegetative growth period ( for 35-50 day ) under three level of N fertilization . High T ( w ) during vegetative growth made the heading stage occur 4-7 day earlier for all level of N fertilization in both year . The crop growth rate during the treatment period wa greatly enhanced by high T ( w ) : by 51-82 % in 2008 and by 49-62 % in 2009 . There wa no T ( w ) x N fertilizer interaction . This increased growth wa associated with increased leaf expansion and increased canopy radiation capture rather than with increased radiation-use efficiency . However , the positive effect decreased during subsequent growth stage under all level of N fertilization , leading to no significant difference in total biomass at maturity . High T ( w ) during vegetative growth greatly reduced SPAD value during the grain-filling stage compared with SPAD value in the control T ( w ) treatment , for all level of N fertilization , and decreased leaf photosynthesis during the mid-grain filling stage . Grain yield wa not significantly affected by high T ( w ) at any N fertilizer level or in either year . ( C ) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All right reserved .

aVCoastal biogeochemical cycle are expected to be affected by global warming . By mean of a mesocosm experiment , the effect of increased water temperature on the biogeochemical cycle of coastal sediment affected by organic-matter enrichment wa tested , focusing on the carbon , sulfur , and iron cycle . Nereis diversicolor wa used a a model specie to simulate macrofaunal bioirrigation activity in natural sediment . Although bioirrigation rate of N. diversicolor were not temperature dependent , temperature did have a major effect on the sediment metabolism . Under organic-enrichment condition , the increase in sediment metabolism wa greater than expected and occurred through the enhancement of anaerobic metabolic pathway rate , mainly sulfate reduction . There wa a twofold increase in sediment metabolism and the accumulation of reduced sulfur . The increase in the benthic metabolism wa maintained by the supply of electron acceptor through bioirrigation and a a result of the availability of iron in the sediment . As long a the sediment buffering capacity toward sulfide is not surpassed , an increase in temperature might promote the recovery of organic-enriched sediment by decreasing the time for mineralization of excess organic matter .

aVMidseason aeration ( MSA ) of rice paddy field function to mitigate CH ( 4 ) emission by a large margin , while simultaneously promoting N ( 2 ) O emission . Alternation of timing and duration of MSA would affect CH ( 4 ) and N ( 2 ) O emission from intermittently irrigated rice paddy . A pot trial and a field experiment were conducted to study the effect of timing and duration of MSA on CH ( 4 ) and N ( 2 ) O emission from irrigated lowland rice paddy soil in China . Four different water regime , i.e. , early aeration , normal aeration ( the same a the local practice in timing and duration of aeration ) , delayed aeration , and prolonged aeration , were adopted separately and compared with respect to global warming potential ( GWP ) of CH ( 4 ) and N ( 2 ) O emission and rice yield a well . Total emission of CH ( 4 ) from the rice field ranged from 28.6 to 64.1 kg CH ( 4 ) ha ( -1 ) , while that of N ( 2 ) O did from 1.71 to 6.30 kg N ( 2 ) O-N ha ( -1 ) during the study period . Compared with the local practice , early aeration reduced CH ( 4 ) emission by 13.3-16.2 % and increased N ( 2 ) O emission by 19.1-68.8 % , while delayed aeration reduced N ( 2 ) O emission by 6.8-26.0 % and increased CH ( 4 ) emission by 22.1-47.3 % . The lowest GWP of CH ( 4 ) and N ( 2 ) O emission occurred in prolonged aeration treatment , however , rice grain yield wa reduced by 15.3 % in this condition when compared with normal practice . It wa found in the experiment that midseason aeration starting around D 30 after rice transplanting , just like the local practice , would optimize rice yield while simultaneously limiting GWPs of CH ( 4 ) and N ( 2 ) O emission from irrigated lowland rice field in China .

aVIntegrated gasification fuel cell ( IGFC ) power plant combining gasification and solid oxide fuel cell ( SOFC ) technology are very promising for highly efficient and environmentally friendly power generation from coal . IGFC plant amenability to carbon capture for sequestration make the technology more attractive given the increasing concern over global climate change caused by greenhouse gas emission . With the support of the US Department of Energy and the National Energy Technology Laboratory , the Advanced Power and Energy Program ha conducted a study to identify promising conceptual design for IGFC plant . The most promising IGFC concept identified so far is a system with catalytic hydro-gasification , a pressurized ( operating pressure of 10 bar ) SOFC followed by a turbo-expander and a steam cycle . The design requirement for recycling de-carbonized anode exhaust back to the gasifier for hydro-gasification not only produce a synergistic integration of SOFC and gasification subsystem , but also make carbon separation a natural result . The current analysis of this system show an efficiency of 58.4 per cent ( coal higher heating value basis ) while capturing 94 per cent of the CO ( 2 ) . Using this system a a baseline case , this work investigates the sensitivity of IGFC system performance on the extent of carbon capture . It is shown that the proposed IGFC system can achieve ultra-high carbon capture ( > 99 per cent ) at small system efficiency expense while reducing carbon capture to below 90 per cent actually diminishes the system efficiency because le fuel is converted in the SOFC .

aVChanges in the soil water regime , predicted a a consequence of global climate change , might influence the N cycle in temperate forest soil . We investigated the effect of decreasing soil water potential on gross ammonification and nitrification in different soil horizon of a Norway spruce forest and tested the hypothesis that i ) gross rate are more sensitive to desiccation in the Oa and EA horizon a compared to the uppermost Oi/Oe horizon and ii ) that gross nitrification is more sensitive than gross ammonification . Soil sample were adjusted by air drying to water potential from about field capacity to around -1.0 MPa , a range that is often observed under field condition at our site . Gross rate were measured using the ( 15 ) N pool dilution technique . To ensure that the addition of solute label to dry soil and the local rewetting doe not affect the result by re-mineralization or preferential consumption of ( 15 ) N , we compared different extraction and incubation time . To time ranging from 10 to 300 min and incubation time of 48 h and 72 h did not influence the rate of gross ammonification and nitrification . Even small change of water potential decreased gross ammonification and nitrification in the 0 horizon . In the EA horizon , gross nitrification wa below detection limit and the response of the generally low rate of gross ammonification to decreasing water potential wa minor . In the Oi/Oe horizon gross ammonification and nitrification decreased from 37.5 to 18.3 mg N kg ( -1 ) soil d ( -1 ) and from 15.4 to 5.6 mg N kg ( -1 ) soil d ( -1 ) when the water potential decreased from field capacity to -0.8 MPa . In the Oa horizon gross ammonification decreased from 7.4 to 4.0 mg N kg ( -1 ) soil d ( -1 ) when the water potential reached -0.6 MPa . At such water potential nitrification almost ceased , while in the Oi/Oe horizon nitrification continued at a rather high level . Hence , only in the Oa horizon nitrification wa more sensitive to desiccation than ammonification . Extended drought period that might result from climate change will cause a reduction in gross N turnover rate in forest soil even at moderate level of soil desiccation . ( C ) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

aVThis work investigates the relationship between plant growth , grain yield , nutrient acquisition and partitioning in rice ( Oryza saliva L. ) under elevated CO ( 2 ) . Plants were grown hydroponically in growth chamber with a 12-h photoperiod at either 370 or 700 mu mol CO ( 2 ) mol ( -1 ) concentration . Plant dry mass ( DM ) , grain yield and macro- and micronutrient concentration of vegetative organ and grain were determined . Elevated CO ( 2 ) increased biomass at tillering , and this wa largely due to an increase in root mass by 160 % . Elevated CO ( 2 ) had no effect on total nutrient uptake ( N , P , K. Mg and Ca ) . However , nutrient partitioning among organ wa significantly altered . N partitioning to leaf blade wa significantly decreased , whereas the N partitioning into the leaf sheath and root wa increased . Nutrient use efficiency of N , P , K , and Mg in all organ wa significantly increased at elevated CO ( 2 ) . At harvest maturity , grain yield wa increased by 27 % at elevated CO ( 2 ) while grain ( protein ) concentration wa decreased by a similar magnitude ( 28 % ) , suggesting that critical nutrient requirement for rice might need to be reassessed with global climate change .

aVEffects of elevated CO ( 2 ) ( twice ambient vs. ambient ) and Bt Cry1Ac transgene ( Bt cotton cv . 33 ( B ) vs. it nontransgenic parental line cv . DP5415 ) on the interspecific competition between two ecologically similar specie of cotton aphid Aphis gossypii and whitefly biotype-Q Bemisia tabaci were studied in open-top chamber . The result indicated that elevated CO ( 2 ) and Bt cotton both affected the population abundance of A. gossypii and biotype-Q B. tabaci when introduced solely ( i.e. , without interspecific competition ) or two specie coexisted ( i.e. , with interspecific competition ) . Compared with ambient CO ( 2 ) , elevated CO ( 2 ) increased the population abundance of A. gossypii and biotype-Q B. tabaci a fed on Bt and nontransgenic cotton on 45 ( i.e. , seedling stage ) and 60 ( i.e. , flowering stage ) day after planting ( DAP ) , but only significantly enhanced aphid abundance without interspecific competition on the 45-DAP nontransgenic cotton and 60-DAP Bt cotton , and significantly increased whitefly abundance with interspecific competition on the 45-DAP Bt cotton and 60-DAP nontransgenic cotton . In addition , compared with nontransgenic cotton at elevated CO ( 2 ) , Bt cotton significantly reduced biotype-Q B. tabaci abundance without and with interspecific competition during seedling and flowering stage , while only significantly decreasing A. gossypii abundance without interspecific competition during the seedling stage . When the two insect specie coexisted , the proportion of biotype-Q B. tabaci were significantly higher than those of A. gossypii on Bt and nontransgenic cotton at the same CO ( 2 ) level , and elevated CO ( 2 ) only significantly increased the percentage of biotype-Q B. tabaci and significantly reduced the proportion of A. gossypii on seedling and flowering nontransgenic cotton . Therefore , the effect of elevated CO ( 2 ) were favorable for biotype-Q B. tabaci to out-compete A. gossypii under the predicted global climate change .

aVThe effect of elevated partial pressure of CO ( 2 ) ( pCO ( 2 ) ) and temperature on the coccolithophore Syracosphaera pulchra were investigated in isolation and in combination . Both the diploid and the haploid life stage were studied . Batch culture were grown under 4 condition : 400 mu atm and 19 degree C ; 400 mu atm and 22 degree C ; 740 mu atm and 19 degree C ; and 740 mu atm and 22 degree C. The growth rate ( mu ) significantly increased under elevated pCO ( 2 ) only in the haploid stage and showed a different pattern with respect to temperature : it wa higher at an elevated temperature in the haploid stage at 400 mu atm whereas it decreased in the diploid stage at 740 mu atm . Increasing both parameter together increased the growth rate by 11 % in the haploid stage only . Elevated pCO ( 2 ) had a negative impact on the content of particulate organic carbon ( POC ) , production and cell size in both life stage at 19 degree C , while no significant effect wa observed at 22 degree C. Increasing temperature significantly increased the content of POC and production in the diploid stage at 740 mu atm , while at 400 mu atm it significantly decreased both the content of POC and production in the haploid stage . A simultaneous increase in pCO ( 2 ) and temperature had a negative effect on the content of POC and production in the haploid stage only . Neither the rate of calcification ( production of particulate inorganic carbon , PIC ) nor the PIC : POC ratio were significantly affected by elevated pCO ( 2 ) , temperature or their interaction . These result showed a strong interactive effect between pCO ( 2 ) and temperature in affecting the physiology of S. pulchra , an effect that wa often more pronounced in the haploid life stage . Elevated pCO ( 2 ) had a stronger effect than temperature .

aVThe atmospheric CO2 concentration is rising , and model predict that by the end of the century it will have increased to twice the amount seen at any given time during the last 15 million yr . This will cause a decrease in average surface water pH of 0.4 , and planktonic protist will be among the organism to be affected first by this change . We tested whether reduced pH ( and increased free CO2 ) would affect plankton community over an incubation period of 14 d. In a laboratory microcosm setup using a natural plankton community from the Derwent River estuary , Australia , 2 treatment with reduced pH ( 8.0 and 7.7 ) were compared to an unaltered control of pH 8.3 . An extreme pH 6.3 wa included for comparison . Measured parameter included community photosynthesis , nutrient uptake and biomass build-up a well a enumeration of 25 protist taxon and quantitative HPLC of phytoplankton pigment . A major succession wa seen during the 14 d , but no effect at all were found in pH treatment 8.0 and 7.7 , whereas the extreme pH 6.3 clearly affected the community for all measured parameter . Thus , it is unlikely that the investigated plankton community would be significantly affected by a pH and CO2 change a predicted for the 21st century . This ha previously been found for other coastal plankton assemblage a well , and we suggest that high pH resilience is a necessity for protist specie living in coastal water with relatively large pH fluctuation .

aVMethane is a potent greenhouse gas and it release to the atmosphere is widely believed to contribute to global warming . Ruminal enteric CH ( 4 ) production represents a loss of 2-15 % of the animal 's gross energy ( GE ) intake and contributes nearly 20 % of US CH ( 4 ) emission . Studies have evaluated the CH ( 4 ) inhibiting potential of select short chain nitrocompounds , such a nitroethane , but result demonstrating their effect on ruminant exhaled CH ( 4 ) emission are lacking . Our study determined effect of oral nitroethane administration on CH ( 4 ) emission , accumulation of volatile fatty acid ( VFA ) and on ruminal CH ( 4 ) producing activity in steer fed a forage based diet containing 8.8 MJ/kg of metabolizable energy on a dry matter ( DM ) basis . Effects of nitroethane administration on ruminal nitroethane reducing activity were also determined . Holstein steer ( n = 24 ) of 317 +/- 6.5 kg body weight ( BW ) were assigned to 4 treatment that included : 0 , 30 , 60 and 120 mg nitroethane/kg BW/d . Treatments were administered via oral gavage twice daily at 08:00 and 16:00 h for 8 d. DM intake decreased quadratically a level of nitroethane increased with steer administered 60 and 120 mg nitroethane/kg BW consuming 14 and 7 % lower DM , respectively , than steer administered 0 or 30 mg nitroethane/kg BW . Methane emission a a proportion of GE intake and ruminal CH ( 4 ) producing activity both decreased linearly ( P < 0.001 ) a level of nitroethane increased . Compared to control steer , daily administration of nitroethane at 60 and 120 mg/kg BW reduced CH ( 4 ) emission a a proportion of GE intake 9-22 % and ruminal CH ( 4 ) producing activity 24-26 % . Ruminal VFA accumulation were unaffected by nitroethane treatment . Results demonstrate that short term oral administration of nitroethane may be an effective anti-methanogenic compound in steer fed high forage diet . Further research is warranted to determine if strategy using nitroethane lower enteric CH ( 4 ) emission in ruminant long term . Ultimately , nitrocompounds which can be reduced by rumen microbe to yield compound with nutritional value for the host , such a amino acid , would be preferred .

aVP > 1 . Many river and stream experience pronounced ice dynamic caused by the formation of anchor and frazil ice , leading to flooding and disturbance of riparian and aquatic community . However , the effect of dynamic ice condition on riverine biota are little known . 2 . We studied the formation of anchor ice in natural stream over 2 year and assessed the effect of anchor ice on riparian vegetation by comparing site with frequent or abundant and little or no anchor ice formation . We also studied the direct impact of ice on riparian plant by experimentally creating ice in the riparian zone over three winter and by exposing plant of different life form to -18 degree C cold ice in the laboratory . 3 . Riparian specie richness per 1-m2 plot wa higher at site affected by anchor ice than at site where anchor ice wa absent or rare , whereas dominance wa lower , suggesting that disturbance by ice enhances specie richness . Species composition wa more homogenous among plot at anchor ice site . By experimentally creating riparian ice , we corroborated the comparative result , with specie richness increasing in ice-treated plot compared to control , irrespective of whether the site showed natural anchor ice . 4 . Because of human alteration of running water , the natural effect of river ice on stream hydrology , geomorphology and ecology are little known . Global warming in northern stream is expected to lead to more dynamic ice condition , offering new challenge for aquatic organism and river management . Our result should stimulate new research , contributing to a better understanding of ecosystem function during winter .

aVEstablishment and growth of three perennial herb and a small tussock grass were studied in an experiment that provided simulated rainfall of 6 mm week ( -1 ) or 25 mm once per month and nitrogen fertilization in combination with the different simulated rainfall regime . Wild onion , Allium macropetalum , failed to establish in plot receiving 25 mm month ( -1 ) simulated rainfall . The perennial composite , Bahia absinthifolia , occurred at higher density in plot that were not irrigated but there were no difference in biomass in any of the irrigation or fertilization treatment . Desert holly , Perezia nana , failed to establish in nitrogen fertilized plot and developed higher abundance and biomass in plot receiving 25 mm month ( -1 ) . Nitrogen fertilization had either no effect or an adverse effect on the perennial herb . The tussock grass . Dasychloa pulchella exhibited highest abundance and biomass with 6 mm week ( -1 ) added water plus nitrogen . Since global climate change will affect both rain storm frequency and size and atmospheric nitrogen deposition , the result of this study are applicable to understanding vegetation response climate change .

aVWe investigated the effect of elevated [ CO ( 2 ) ] , [ O ( 3 ) ] and temperature on plant productivity and if these climate factor interacted with each other in multifactor treatment . The climate effect were studied in 14 different cultivars/lines of European spring oilseed rape ( Brassica napu L. ) and spring barley ( Hordeum vulgare L. ) . Seven genotype of each specie were cultivated in six single-and multifactor treatment with ambient or elevated CO ( 2 ) ( 385 ppm and 700 ppm ) , O ( 3 ) ( 20 ppb and 60 ppb ) and temperature ( 12/19 degree C and 17/24 degree C ) . Growth and production parameter were measured . Elevated CO ( 2 ) increased yield and biomass . Seed number increased by about 47 % in barley and by 26 % in oilseed rape , but in oilseed rape , the TSW wa significantly decreased , possibly because of shortening of the seed filling period . Higher temperature decreased yield and biomass significantly in both specie . A significantly decreased yield and thousand grain weight wa also seen in barley due to elevated O ( 3 ) . The multifactor combination of elevated CO ( 2 ) , O ( 3 ) and temperature showed a decrease in growth and production in the two specie , though not statistically significant for all parameter . This trend suggests that the expected increase in the plant production in northern Europe , indicated by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) a a consequence of increased [ CO ( 2 ) ] and temperature , may not hold , due to interaction between these abiotic factor .

aVWe analysed the evolution of drought on the NW Iberian Peninsula from 1930 to 2006 , and identified difference between the effect of precipitation variability and warming process on drought severity and surface water resource . Two drought index were used , one based on precipitation ( the standardised precipitation index , SPI ) and the other based on water balance , a reflected by the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration , PET ( the standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index , SPEI ) . The result show that precipitation ha increased in the region , but a significant increase ha also occurred in PET . No statistically significant difference were found over the study period for the severity of drought , a assessed by both the SPI and SPEI . In addition , although in the last 3 decade the mean duration of drought episode ha increased by approximately 1 mo a a consequence of the increase of the PET rate , the difference are not statistically significant . River discharge is mainly driven by precipitation variability , whereas warming process did not have a noticeable influence on the streamflow variability between 1930 and 2006 . The implication of global warming projected by global climate model on future drought severity and the availability of water resource are highly relevant in the near future .

aVSTEP ( solar thermal electrochemical production ) theory is derived and experimentally verified for the electrosynthesis of energetic molecule at solar energy efficiency greater than any photovoltaic conversion efficiency . In STEP the efficient formation of metal , fuel , chlorine , and carbon capture is driven by solar thermal heated endothermic electrolyses of concentrated reactant occuring at a voltage below that of the room temperature energy stored in the product . One example is CO2 , which is reduced to either fuel or storable carbon at a solar efficiency of over 50 % due to a synergy of efficient solar thermal absorption and electrochemical conversion at high temperature and reactant concentration . CO2-free production of iron by STEP , from iron ore , occurs via Fe ( III ) in molten carbonate . Water is efficiently split to hydrogen by molten hydroxide electrolysis , and chlorine , sodium , and magnesium from molten chloride . A pathway is provided for the STEP decrease of atmospheric carbon dioxide level to pre-industial age level in 10 year .

aVAtmospheric CO2 concentration ( C-a ) is rising , predicted to cause global warming , and alter precipitation pattern . During 1994 , spring barley ( Hordeum vulgare L cv . Alexis ) wa grown in a strip-split-plot experimental design to determine the effect that the main plot C-a treatment [ A : Ambient at 370 mu mol ( CO2 ) mol ( -1 ) ; E : Enriched with free-air CO2 enrichment ( FACE ) at similar to 550 mu mol ( CO2 ) mol ( -1 ) ] had on several gas exchange property of fully expanded sunlit primary leaf . The interacting strip-split-plot irrigation treatment were Dry or Wet [ 50 % ( D ) or 100 % ( W ) replacement of potential evapotranspiration ] at ample nitrogen ( 261 kg N ha ( -1 ) ) and phosphorous ( 29 kg P ha ( -1 ) ) fertility . Elevated C-a facilitated drought avoidance by reducing stomatal conductance ( g ( s ) ) by 34 % that conserved water and enabled stoma to remain open for a longer period into a drought . This resulted in a 28 % reduction in drought-induced midafternoon depression in net assimilation rate ( A ) . Elevated C-a increased A by 37 % under Dry and 23 % under Wet . Any reduction in A under Wet condition occurred because of nonstomatal limitation , whereas under Dry it occurred because of stomatal limitation . Elevated C-a increased the diurnal integral of A ( A ' ) that resulted in an increase in the seasonal-long integral of A ' ( A '' ) for barley leaf by 12 % ( P = 0.14 ) under both Dry and Wet - 650 , 730 , 905 and 1020 +/- 65 g ( C ) m ( -2 ) y ( -1 ) for AD , ED . AW and EW treatment , respectively . Elevated C-a increased season-long average dry weight ( DWS ; crown , shoot ) by 14 % ( P = 0.02 ) , whereas deficit irrigation reduced DWS by 7 % ( P = 0.06 ) , although these value may have been affected by a short but severe pea aphid [ Acyrthosiphon pisum ( Harris ) ] infestation . Hence , an elevated-C-a-based improvement in gas exchange property enhanced growth of a barley crop . ( C ) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V .

aVActively-growing , single-stemmed plant of five Scandinavian and British cultivar of black currant ( Ribes nigrum L. ) were exposed to autumn temperature of 9 degree , 12 degree , 18 degree , and 24 degree C in daylight phytotron compartment with natural daylength condition at As , Norway ( 59 degree 40 ' N ) in order to evaluate the effect of elevated autumn temperature on growth cessation and floral initiation in this specie . The treatment were started on 11 August and lasted until 13 October ( 9 week ) when the plant were moved outdoors for cold-hardening for 7 week , then cold-stored at -2 degree C over the Winter . The following Spring , the plant were moved into a heated greenhouse at 15 degree C with natural daylength condition and monitored for bud burst and flowering and fruiting performance . Unexpectedly , the cessation of growth in the Autumn wa promoted by increasing temperature , and wa earliest at 24 degree C. The high-latitude cultivar , 'Ojebyn ' , and the Norwegian-bred 'Kristin ' were the most temperature-responsive cultivar , while the Norwegian cultivar , 'Narve Viking ' wa least influenced by Autumn temperature . Leaf senescence and abscission , which followed in due course , were also promoted by high Autumn temperature in 'Ojebyn ' , but by low Autumn temperature in all other cultivar . Bud burst in the following Spring wa consistently delayed by a few day by high Autumn temperature , while flowering wa earliest in plant from intermediate temperature . Furthermore , the magnitude of flowering wa increased several-fold by elevated Autumn temperature , usually reaching an optimum at 18 degree C. Again , this enhancement effect wa least in `Narve Viking ' , in which the extent of flowering wa also significantly reduced when autumn temperature increase from 18 degree C to 24 degree C. It is concluded that elevated Autumn temperature , a a consequence of global warming , doe not represent a threat to the normal cessation of growth or floral initiation in black currant .

aVGlobal CO ( 2 ) emission are understood to be the largest contributor to anthropogenic climate change , and have , to date , been highly correlated with economic output . However , there is likely to be a negative feedback between climate change and human wealth : economic growth is typically associated with an increase in CO ( 2 ) emission and global warming , but the resulting climate change may lead to damage that suppress economic growth . This climate-economy feedback is assumed to be weak in standard climate change assessment . When the feedback is incorporated in a transparently simple model it reveals possible emergent behaviour in the coupled climate-economy system . Formulae are derived for the critical rate of growth of global CO ( 2 ) emission that cause damped or long-term boom-bust oscillation in human wealth , thereby preventing a soft landing of the climate-economy system . On the basis of this model , historical rate of economic growth and decarbonization appear to put the climate-economy system in a potentially damaging oscillatory regime .

aVToday , much interest ha been given to the utilization of material of plant origin a substitution of fossil fuel in meeting energy need to reduce the level of atmospheric pollutant emission and global warming threat . Special emphasis ha been placed on the co-combustion of coal and biomass . In this study , SO2 and NOx emission level during volatile evolution and combustion period of single pellet of one high sulfur content lignite , demineralized lignite , poplar wood , and their blend were studied by burning them in a cylindrical wire mesh basket placed into a preheated tube furnace . Flue gas composition revealed that majority of sulfur-containing component evolved and oxidized to SO2 during volatile combustion , and no SO2 wa involved during the most length of char combustion period . NOx emission were only in the form of NO , confined mostly in volatile matter combustion period , and continued after disappearance of volatile flame in very smaller level . NO formation can be explained mostly by fuel and volatile flame NO mechanism . Except lignite-wood blend , no synergy wa observed in the combustion of demineralized lignite-wood blend in term of pollutant component .

A crucial moment in the process of dealing with this issue wa the opening of the discussion on global warming . One of the effect of this discussion is that the pressure on a fast introduction of new technology , procedure and new legislation , which would result in reducing energy performance of outdoor a well a indoor lighting system , ha been increasing . This paper deal with the relationship between the technical parameter of illumination and the energy performance of lighting and describes possible trend in achieving energy efficient lighting system .

aVVentilation is ambiguously related to the energy saving rationale originating from the mitigation of global warming , the reaching of peak oil or health concern related to fossil fuel burning . Since it make up for about half of the energy consumption in well-insulated building , it is an attractive target for energy saving measure . However , simply reducing ventilation rate ha unwanted repercussion on the indoor air quality . Two main strategy have been developed to reconcile these seemingly opposing interest : heat recovery and demand control ventilation . This paper focus on the energy saving potential of demand controlled mechanical exhaust ventilation in residence and on the influence such system may have on the indoor air quality to which the occupant of the dwelling are exposed . The conclusion are based on simulation done with a multi-zone airflow model of a detached house that is statistically representative for the average Belgian dwelling . Four approach to demand based control are tested and reported . Within the paper exposure to carbon dioxide and to a tracer gas are used a indicator for indoor air quality . Both energy demand and exposure are reported and compared to the result for a standard , building code compliant , exhaust system , operating at continuous flow rate . The sensitivity of the control strategy to environmental and user variation is tested using Monte-Carlo technique . Under the condition that were applied , reduction on the ventilation heat loss of 25-60 % are found , depending on the chosen control strategy ( with the exclusion of adventitious ventilation and infiltration ) .

aVEnergy use is a very important question nowadays in the context of global warming and the cost of energy . `` Energy conservation '' is paradoxal : environmental awareness is increasing , but so is energy demand . Sociological knowledge concerning energy us and energy saving remain important to understand the possible evolution of practice and value and thus possible future energy policy . Can the `` consumer society '' become a `` le energy-intensive '' society ? This paper 's purpose wa to understand how individual , at each stage of life , in the context of historic event and intra-familial relationship , build a specific relationship to energy and `` energy care '' ( paying attention to energy ) and a specific appropriation of public policy , energy-efficient technology and environmental discourse . The notion of `` logic of action '' provides a way to combine the analysis of historical event and the analysis of daily practice , integrating the way people act , the justification of action and the dynamic of life course stage . The social age approach ha policy implication , for example , helping to segment people 's profile and to tailor the tool to age group . The paper also question the fact that some policy focus on child to transmit their message . This paper is based on the analysis of several qualitative study in various age group of French people .

aVLignocellulosic ethanol ha received special research interest , driven by concern over high fuel price , security of energy supply , global climate change a well a the search of opportunity for rural economic development . A well-to-wheel analysis wa conducted for ethanol obtained from black locust ( Robinia pseudoacacia L. ) by mean of the life cycle assessment ( LCA ) methodology . This study ass the environmental profile of using ethanol in mixture E10 and E85 a transport fuel in comparison with conventional gasoline ( CG ) . In addition , the best model of black locust cultivation wa analysed under an environmental point of view . The standard framework of LCA from International Standards Organisation wa followed . To compare the environmental profile , the study addressed the impact potential taking into account the distance travelled by vehicle with the fuel tank full of CG . The product system includes all the process involved from the black locust cultivation to the final use of fuel in a vehicle . The transport of all the chemical and product is also included in the system boundary . According to the result , fuel ethanol derived from black locust biomass may help to reduce the contribution to global warming , acidification , eutrophication and fossil fuel use specifically due to the low input production regime of the agricultural stage . These reduction would be increased with the increasing ratio of ethanol in the blend . Moreover , the use of lignin , biogas and other solid waste a fuel to meet the energy requirement of the plant , positively contribute to the environmental profile of cellulosic ethanol . On the contrary , ethanol blend are le environment friendly that CG in term of photochemical oxidant formation . The cultivation of black locust following a low-input production regime , without agrochemicals application and extra irrigation is an important reason for the environmental improvement . Efforts should be made to promote the production of black locust according to principle of sustainable cultivation . Moreover , technological development in ethanol production could help to improve the environmental profile in the life cycle of ethanol-based fuel . It could be interesting to develop a strategic planning which allows identifying the potential region not only in Italy but also in other European country in order to increase the black locust biomass yield . The cultivation of short rotation forestry and/or short rotation coppice under low-input regime present potential environmental benefit and advantage for the future of second-generation ethanol production in Europe .

aVThe correlation between skeletal parameter ( bulk density , micro-density and porosity ) , coral age and sea surface temperature were assessed along a latitudinal gradient in the zooxanthellate coral Balanophyllia europaea and in the azooxanthellate coral Leptopsammia pruvoti . In both coral specie , the variation of bulk density wa more influenced by the variation of porosity than of micro-density . With increasing polyp age , B. europaea formed denser and le porous skeleton while L pruvoti showed the opposite trend , becoming le dense and more porous . B. europaea skeleton were generally le porous ( more dense ) than those of L pruvoti , probably a a consequence of the different habitat colonized by the two specie . Increasing temperature had a negative impact on the zooxanthellate specie , leading to an increase of porosity . In contrast , micro-density increased with temperature in the azooxanthellate specie . It is hypothesized that the increase in porosity with increasing temperature observed in B. europaea could depend on an attenuation of calcification due to an inhibition of the photosynthetic process at elevated temperature , while the azooxanthellate specie appears more resistant to variation of temperature , highlighting possible difference in the sensitivity/tolerance of these two coral specie to temperature change in face of global climate change .

These aim have been crystallized in recent year within the context of global climate change and environmental pollution , increasing the urgency of the need to predict how vegetation will respond across spatial scale . We investigated whether genetic diversity is associated with the way in which phenotypic plasticity within plant population is realized and whether this is related to genotype abundance . We used environmental metabolomics to demonstrate biochemical variation between co-occurring genotype of Carex caryophyllea L. A novel combined metabolomic/functional trait analysis wa used to test the functionality of this variation in governing plasticity to variation in edaphic condition , with particular reference tometabolic pathway that play important role in growth-related trait . We show that genetic diversity within a wild C. caryophyllea population relates to difference in metabolic composition and functional trait in response to soil nutrient variation , influencing genotype abundance within a community . Our finding highlight the vital role genetic diversity play within a population in facilitating plant phenotypic plasticity and the potential usefulness of environmental metabolomics to future ecological study .

aVThe ice crystal enhancement ( IE ) factor , defined a the ratio of the ice crystal to ice nucleus ( IN ) number concentration for any particular cloud condition , is needed to quantify the contribution of change in IN to global warming . However , the ensemble characteristic of IE are still unclear . In this paper , a representation of the IE factor is incorporated into a three-ice-category microphysical scheme for use in long-term cloud-resolving model ( CRM ) simulation . Model result are compared with remote sensing observation , which suggest that , absent a physically based consideration of how IE come about , the IE factor in tropical cloud is about 10 3 time larger than that in midlatitudinal one . This significant difference in IE between the tropic and middle latitude is consistent with the observation of stronger entrainment and detrainment in the tropic . In addition , the difference also suggests that cloud microphysical parameterizations depend on spatial resolution ( or subgrid turbulence parameterizations within CRMs ) .

aVThis article present a review of the literature on tick-borne encephalitis virus and epidemiology of tick-borne encephalitis . Tick-borne encephalitis virus ( TBEV ) is a member of the Flaviviridae family . The most important antigen of TBEV is the envelope protein E , which induces protective immunity , function a the ligand to the cell receptor and is responsible for the virulence of TBEV . TBEV consists of three subtypes : the European , Far Eastern and Siberian . Despite very similar antigen structure the virulence of different subtypes of TBEV differs . The main vector of TBEV are Ixodes spp . tick . Ticks can be infected by viremic , non-viremic , transovarial and transstadial tarnsmission . Non-viremic transmission of TBEV is the most important for the maintenance and spreading of TBEV in natural focus . 0.1-26.6 % of tick are infected with TBEV within endemic area . More than one hundred animal specie , including mammal , bird and reptile , can serve a host of the tick , which are divided into reservoir , indicator and accidental host . Small rodent are the main reservoir of TBEV . TBEV prevalence in small rodent is in a range from 15 to 47.9 % . Birds are not important a reservoir host , but can spread the virus into new area . The incidence of tick-borne encephalitis ( TBE ) in Europe ha increased 4 time over the last three decade . The reason of the increase in incidence of TBE are complex and associated with expanding vector and host population , influenced by global warming . Other reason are social , economical and associated with human activity . Increased awareness of tick-borne disease , improved diagnostics and epidemiological surveillance also influence the increasing number of TBE case .

aVThe runoff regime of glacierized headwater catchment in the Alps is essentially characterized by snow and ice melt . High Alpine drainage basin influence distant downstream catchment of the Rhine River basin . In particular , during the summer month , low-flow condition are probable with strongly reduced snow and ice melt under climate change condition . This study attempt to quantify present and future contribution from snow and ice melt to summer runoff at different spatial scale . For the small Silvretta catchment ( 103 km ( 2 ) ) in the Swiss Alps , with a glacierization of 7 % , the HBV model and the glacio-hydrological model GERM are applied for calculating future runoff based on different regional climate scenario . We evaluate the importance of snow and ice melt in the runoff regime . Comparison of the model indicates that the HBV model strongly overestimate the future contribution of glacier melt to runoff , a glacier are considered a static component . Furthermore , we provide estimate of the current meltwater contribution of glacier for several catchment downstream on the River Rhine during the month of August . Snow and ice melt process have a significant direct impact on summer runoff , not only for high mountain catchment , but also for large transboundary basin . A future shift in the hydrological regime and the disappearance of glacier might favour low-flow condition during summer along the Rhine .

aVthe red algae Porphyra yezoensis ha high commercial and nutritional value ; however , it cultivation and product quality are jeopardized by global warming . Screening of high-temperature-tolerant strain would greatly reduce cultivation risk and benefit the Porphyra industry . Single somatic cell isolated enzymatically from the wildtype ( WT ) blade irradiated by ( 60 ) Co-gamma ray were screened at 25 degree C ; one strain , T-17 , displayed significant high-temperature resistance . Further culture study showed that conchospore germlings of T-17 showed 76.2 % survival at 23 degree C and 65.7 % survival at 24 degree C , while the WT conchospore germlings survived at significantly lower percentage of 16.9 % and 11.5 % , respectively , over a period of 16 day . Furthermore , T-17 conchospore germlings divided at higher percentage of 100 % at both 23 and 24 degree C compared to the WT conchospores with 99.8 % and 81.8 % , respectively . When the 50-day-old F ( 1 ) gametophytic blade were transferred from the optimal temperature of 18 degree C to high temperature of 23 and 24 degree C , the T-17 blade sustained growth over a 45-day period without rot , and their mean length increased by 20 and 4.2 time , respectively . The mean length of WT blade only increased by a factor of 0.6 and 0.4 time and were severely decayed after being cultured for 15 day at high temperature . The mean wet weight of T-17 blade increased by 418.9 and 195.3 time , but only 7.8 and 4.6 time in WT at 23 and 24 degree C , respectively . These result indicate that T-17 is superior to WT in growth and high-temperature tolerance , which may offer a new cultivar for the nori industry a a high-temperature-resistant strain to counteract the effect of global warming .

aVWe apply an evolutionary game theoretic approach to the evolution of dispersal in explicitly spatial metacommunities , using a flexible parametric class of dispersal kernel , namely 2Dt kernel , and study the resulting evolutionary dynamic and outcome . We observe strong selective pressure on mean dispersal distance ( i.e. , the first moment ) , and weaker , but significant , one on the shape of dispersal kernel ( i.e. , higher moment ) . We investigate the effect of landscape topology and spatial heterogeneity on the resulting 'optimal ' dispersal kernel . The shape-importantly the tail structure-and stability of evolutionarily optimal dispersal strategy are strongly affected by landscape topology or connectivity . Specifically , the result suggest that the optimal dispersal kernel in the river network topology have heavier tail and are stable , while those in the direct topology , where organism are allowed to travel directly from one location to another , have relatively thin tail and may be unstable . We also find that habitat spatial heterogeneity enables coexistence and control spatial distribution of distinct group of dispersal strategy and that alteration in topology alone may not be sufficient to change such coexistence . This work provides a tool to translate environmental change such a global climate change and human intervention into change in dispersal behavior , which in turn may lead to important alteration of biodiversity and biological invasion pattern .

aVThe ongoing increase in extremely warm temperature event across large area of the globe is generally thought to be a signature of a more extreme climate . However , it is still unclear whether global warming is accompanied by change in statistical property beyond the mean , such a an increasing temperature variability . Here we shed light on this issue by uncovering the way probability of extreme are being influenced by temperature evolution . Focusing on Europe , we show how the behavior of warm and cold extreme can be determined to a high accuracy by statistically modeling daily temperature and their change . Detailed comparison with observation over the past decade put forward the dominant role of the mean in explaining exceptionally hot event , and rule out contribution from potential change in second and higher moment .

aVVirtually all specie have developed cellular oscillation and mechanism that synchronize these cellular oscillation to environmental cycle . Such environmental cycle in biotic ( e. g. food availability and predation risk ) or abiotic ( e. g. temperature and light ) factor may occur on a daily , annual or tidal time scale . Internal timing mechanism may facilitate behavioural or physiological adaptation to such change in environmental condition . These timing mechanism commonly involve an internal molecular oscillator ( a 'clock ' ) that is synchronized ( 'entrained ' ) to the environmental cycle by receptor mechanism responding to relevant environmental signal ( 'Zeitgeber ' , i.e . German for time-giver ) . To understand the evolution of such timing mechanism , we have to understand the mechanism leading to selective advantage . Although major advance have been made in our understanding of the physiological and molecular mechanism driving internal cycle ( proximate question ) , study identifying mechanism of natural selection on clock system ( ultimate question ) are rather limited . Here , we discus the selective advantage of a circadian system and how it adaptation to day length variation may have a functional role in optimizing seasonal timing . We discus various case where selective advantage of circadian timing mechanism have been shown and case where temporarily loss of circadian timing may cause selective advantage . We suggest an explanation for why a circadian timing system ha emerged in primitive life form like cyanobacteria and we evaluate a possible molecular mechanism that enabled these bacteria to adapt to seasonal variation in day length . We further discus how the role of the circadian system in photoperiodic time measurement may explain differential selection pressure on circadian period when specie are exposed to changing climatic condition ( e. g. global warming ) or when they expand their geographical range to different latitude or altitude .

aVIn the early 1990s it wa hypothesized that the global warming process would produce an increase in sea-land temperature gradient and , subsequently , enhance the wind pattern responsible for coastal upwelling . Hence , an increase in the intensity of coastal upwelling wa expected in the main upwelling ecosystem around the world . However , recently published analysis of the evolution of coastal upwelling process have shown contradictory evidence . For this reason , time series of sea-surface temperature ( SST ) and the upwelling index I ( w ) extracted from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis project database and covering the last 6 decade were studied . The time series analysis focused on the northern part of the Canary Current System and included comparison with upwelling system off NW Africa , California , Benguela and Peru . Climatic index , including the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation , Eastern Atlantic Pattern , Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation Index and North Atlantic Oscillation , were investigated to explain the variability found in the NCEP/NCAR time series . A general sea-surface warming and weakening of the upwelling intensity in the Iberian/Canary and NW African region were found and these have intensified in the last 4 decade . These trend were clearly observed in winter and autumn for both region , and a weakening in the upwelling intensity wa also detected in summer in the NW African region . The North Atlantic Oscillation and the Eastern Atlantic Pattern index correlated with both SST and I ( w ) , particularly in winter and spring , and also with both the Iberian/Canary and NW African region . No clear trend wa found for the California region , while , conforming to the hypothesis , the Benguela region exhibited enhancement of upwelling , but only slight sea-surface warming . In contrast , the Peru region indicated a weakening of upwelling accompanied by marginal sea-surface warming .

aVThere is growing evidence of the Lilliput effect in the end-Permian mass extinction and it aftermath . However , very little ha been published on assessing the Lilliput effect on protozoan in the Early Triassic based on quantitative analysis of a great quantity of sample from outcrop section . This study investigates foraminiferal test size variation through the Changhsingian to the Olenekian based on fossil record from three outcrop section in South China . The sharp reduction in foraminifer size coincides with the first or main episode of the end-Permian mass extinction . Foraminifers remained small in size in the early Induan . Their body size increased slowly in the late Induan to Olenekian , but never recovered to the pre-extinction test size level . The Lilliput effect on foraminifera in the aftermath of the end-Permian crisis is indicated by the extinction of large taxon , decrease in size for surviving taxon and rise of small-sized new form . Physiological reaction of various foraminifer group reveal that several defaunation event such a anoxia , ocean acidification , and global warming that prevailed through the Permian-Triassic interval may be responsible for both the end-Permian crisis and the Lilliput effect .

aVThe paper study a novel excitability type where a large excitable response appears when a system 's parameter is varied gradually , or ramped , above some critical rate . This occurs even though there is a ( unique ) stable quiescent state for any fixed setting of the ramped parameter . We give a necessary and a sufficient condition for the existence of a critical ramping rate in a general class of slow-fast system with folded slow ( critical ) manifold . Additionally , we derive an analytical condition for the critical rate by relating the excitability threshold to a canard trajectory through a folded saddle singularity . The general framework is used to explain a potential climate tipping point termed the 'compost-bomb instability'-an explosive release of soil carbon from peatlands into the atmosphere occurs above some critical rate of global warming even though there is a unique asymptotically stable soil carbon equilibrium for any fixed atmospheric temperature .

aVGlobal warming is expected to change plant defence through it influence on plant primary resource . Increased temperature ( T ) will increase photosynthesis , and thus carbon ( C ) availability , but may also increase soil mineralization and availability of nitrogen ( N ) . More access to C and N is expected to mainly increase plant growth , and , according to hypothesis on resource based defence , this could lower plant concentration of carbon-based secondary compound ( CBSCs ) . We used two already established warming experiment with open top chamber ( OTCs ) and control plot in alpine south-western Norway , one on a ridge ( 8 year ' treatment ) and a one in a leeside ( 3 year ' treatment ) , to study the effect of warming on plant and lichen defensive compound concentration . The study included five vascular plant and six lichen specie . One vascular plant specie had lower concentration of CBSCs under elevated T , while the others did not respond to the treatment . In lichen there were no effect of warming on CBSCs , but a tendency to reduced total C concentration . However , there were effect of warming on nitrogen , a the concentration decreased inside OTCs for three specie , while it increased for one lichen specie . Lichens generally had higher CBSC and total C concentration on the ridge than in the leeside , but no such pattern were seen for vascular plant . No elevated temperature effect on CBCSs is most probably a result of high constitutive defence under the limiting alpine condition , suggesting that chemical defence is little subject to change under climate warming , at least on a short-term basis . We suggest that the driving force of plant defence in the arctic-alpine should be tested individually under controlled condition , and suggest that competition from other plant may be a greater threat under climate warming than increased herbivory or disease attack .

aVSeveral carbon cycle model listed in the IPCC material are used for assessing the atmospheric CO ( 2 ) response to various scenario for the CO ( 2 ) anthropogenic emission into the atmosphere . The same material present the Green function expression of these model in term of this exponential approximation , i.e. , in the form of a sum of exponent . The uncertainty that occur when the Green function is substituted by it exponential approximation are investigated . The reason of such an analysis is a classic conclusion that a general problem of the exponential approximation refers to the class of inconsistent problem .

aVExtreme climatic event , including hot day , cold night and heavy rainfall day , were analysed for 7 climatic sub-regions in Vietnam , based on historical observed data and climate projection of the International Center for Theoretical Physics regional climate model version 3 ( RegCM3 ) . Firstly , historical observed data set covering 1961-2007 were analyzed to detect extreme event and their decade-by-decade trend . Extreme event and their change are quite different over the 7 sub-regions , owing to their different local climate . Secondly , the extreme of each sub-region detected from the simulation of RegCM3 for the baseline period 1980-1999 were applied to the projection in the year 2001-2050 , based on the IPCC SRES A1B and A2 scenario , to reveal the changing trend of extreme in the future . The RegCM3 projection indicate that , in general , hot summer day will increase and cold winter night will decrease a a consequence of global warming . The rainy season heavy rainfall event tend to decrease for all sub-regions except for 2 , in northwest and south-central Vietnam . Strong opposite projected change in precipitation extreme over the southern half of Vietnam seem to be linked to change in southwesterly air flow from the Bay of Bengal and the number of strong tropical cyclone coming from the South China Sea and the NW Pacific .

aVHeavy precipitation and the resulting flooding are the most serious weather-related hazard over the west coast of North America . This paper analyzes the trend in heavy precipitation for the period 1950-2009 by examining the decadal distribution of the top 60 , 40 , and 20 two-day precipitation event for a collection of station along the coastal zone of the United States and British Columbia , a well a the decadal distribution of maximum daily discharge for unregulated river from northern California to Washington State . During the past 60 year there ha been a modest increase in heavy precipitation event over southern and central coastal California , a decline in heavy event from northern California through the central Oregon coast , a substantial increase in major event over Washington , and a modest increase over coastal British Columbia . Most of these trend are not significantly different from zero at the 95 % level . The trend in maximum daily discharge of unregulated river are consistent with the above pattern , with increasing discharge over the past three decade over Washington and northern Oregon and decline over the remainder of Oregon and northern California . Finally , the above trend in heavy rainfall and daily discharge are compared to the future pattern indicated by general circulation model under various global warming scenario .

In no case we have found indication that fluctuation of these parameter have increased with time . ( C ) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVDeveloping management strategy for addressing global climate change ha become an increasingly important issue influencing forest management around the globe . Currently , management approach are being proposed that intend to ( 1 ) mitigate climate change by enhancing forest carbon store and ( 2 ) foster adaptation by maintaining compositionally and structurally complex forest . However , little is known about the compatibility of these two objective or the long-term efficacy of a given management regime at simultaneously achieving adaptation and mitigation . To address this need , we examined stand-level carbon and complexity response using five long-term ( > 50 yr ) silviculture experiment within the upper Great Lakes region , USA . In particular , live tree carbon store and sequestration rate , and compositional and structural complexity were analyzed from three thinning experiment in Pinus resinosa and two selection method experiment in northern hardwood system to elucidate the long-term effect of management on these ecosystem attribute and the general compatibility of mitigation and adaptation objective . As expected , we observed a general increase in large tree density with stand age and positive relationship between stand stocking level and live tree carbon store . More importantly , our result clearly identify tradeoff between the achievement of mitigation and adaptation objective across each study . For example , maintaining higher stocking level ( i.e. , enhanced mitigation by increasing carbon store ) resulted in decrease in stand-level structural and compositional complexity ( i.e. , reduced adaptation potential ) . In addition , rate of live tree carbon increment were also the lowest within the highest stocking level ; despite the benefit of these stand condition to maximizing carbon store . Collectively , these finding underscore the importance of avoiding rigid adherence to a single objective , such a maximum on-site carbon store , without recognizing potential consequence to other ecosystem component crucial to ensuring long-term ecosystem functioning within the context of environmental change . One potential stand-level strategy for balancing these goal may be to employ multi-aged management system , such a irregular shelterwood and selection system , that maintain a large proportion of carbon store in retained mature tree while using thinning to create spatial heterogeneity that promotes higher sequestration rate in smaller , younger tree and simultaneously enhances structural and compositional complexity .

aVPopulation-level effect of global warming result from concurrent direct and indirect process . They are typically described by physiologically structured population model ( PSPMs ) . Therefore , inverse modelling offer a tool to identify parameter of individual physiological process through population-level data analysis , e. g. the temperature dependence of growth from size-frequency data of a field population . Here , we make use of experiment under laboratory condition , in mesocosms and field monitoring to determine the temperature dependence of growth and mortality of Gammarus pulex . We found an optimum temperature for growth of approximately 17 degree C and a related temperature coefficient , Q ( 10 ) , of 1.5 degree C ( -1 ) , irrespective of whether we classically fitted individual growth curve or applied inverse modelling based on PSPMs to laboratory data . From a comparison of underlying data set we conclude that applying inverse modelling technique to population-level data result in meaningful response parameter for physiological process if additional temperature-driven effect , including within-population interaction , can be excluded or determined independently . If this is not the case , parameter estimate describe a cumulative response , e. g. comprising temperature-dependent resource dynamic . Finally , fluctuating temperature in natural habitat increased the uncertainty in parameter value . Here , PSPM should be applied for virtual monitoring in order to determine a sampling scheme that comprises important date to reduce parameter uncertainty .

aVThere is growing interest in what control the present distribution of terrestrial vegetation in Antarctica because of the potential use of biodiversity a an indicator or predictor of the effect of climate change . Recent advance in knowledge of distribution and ecophysiological performance of terrestrial vegetation mean that an initial analysis of the potential influence of temperature is now possible . Regressions of specie number of lichen , moss and hepatic on latitude and mean annual temperature ( standard macroclimatic data ) were carried out , and the terrestrial vegetation in Antarctica could be divided into two zone . The microenvironmental zone lie south of around 72 degree S , and biodiversity ( richness and location ) is uncoupled from the macroenvironment and is , instead , determined by the occasional coincidence of warmth , water , light and shelter . The macroenvironmental zone lie north of about 72 degree S , and biodiversity ( richness , cover and growth ) is strongly positively linked to mean annual temperature ; specie number increase at about 9-10 % per K ( 24.0 , 9.3 and 1.8 specie for lichen , moss and hepatic , respectively ) probably due to improved water availability through increased precipitation and longer active period ( monthly degree-days also reach zero at about 72 degree S ) allowing greater productivity , completion of metabolic process and a switch from survival to growth strategy . Cyanobacterial lichen appear to be a special case and may be expanding after being forced into northerly refugia . Warming will cause a southward movement of the boundary between the two zone but distribution in the microenvironmental zone will remain determined by local coincidence of environment and resource .

aVThis paper report the outcome from an International Workshop on 'Animal Production in a Changing World ' held in Clermont-Ferrand ( INRA-Theix , France ) on 9-10 September 2009 in which 35 participant from 15 different country participated . The main objective wa to discus the main challenge within the livestock sector : it environmental impact and role in global climate change ; balancing the need for increased production of animal product coupled with a lower footprint and addressing societal need in term of product quality for the consumer . Five key lecture presented the main driver of animal agriculture : population growth , environmental impact , mitigation and adaptation option , efficiency of production and quality of animal product . The key lecture highlighted the synergy between research need and strategy dedicated to improving food quality and safety and those devoted to decreasing the environmental impact of ruminant livestock production . After the lecture two discussion group were set up to discus the main research priority in relation to reducing environmental footprint and improving product quality . The main remark from the group working on product quality were that the existing knowledge is not fully applied , the priority with regard to quality differ between developing and developed country and that , a one component in assessing food quality , an environmental index need to be established taking into account carbon footprint , water and energy use . The discussion within the group working on environmental issue highlighted the importance of focusing on whole life cycle analysis in the mitigation area , while the adaptation strategy should be based on selection for profitable animal under different production system . In summary , a fundamental shift in designing our production system is required to help ensure present need for animal product are met without compromising future generation .

aVAs a result of new policy related to global warming announced by the European Union , avoiding unnecessary energy waste and reducing environmental pollution level are becoming a major issue in the automotive industry . Accordingly , the lap welding of Zn-coated steel process , which is commonly used for producing car door , ha been gradually developed to lap welding of Zn-coated steel to light material , such a Al alloy , Mg alloy and composite material , in order to effectively reduce the vehicle weight . In certain part of car manufacture , organic glue are used to temporally join the Zn-coated steel and Al alloy before permanent welding take place . The stability of such temporary joining by glue need improving . Laser `` stitching '' or low strength welding could be considered a an alternative . However , challenge exist in joining Zn-coated steel on Al alloy by laser welding , due to significant difference of material property between the two welding material . Porosity , spatter and intermetallic brittle phase are readily produced in the weld . In this study , the effect of welding speed , laser power , number of the welding pass and type of shielding gas in gap-free welding of Zn-coated steel on Al alloy were investigated using a 1 kW single mode continuous wave fibre laser . Results show that a weld with higher shear strength in the laser stitching application and le intermetallic phase could be obtained when nitrogen gas wa used a the shielding gas . The corrosion resistance and the surface finish of the weld could be improved in double pas welding , especially when argon gas wa used a the shielding gas .

aVGas exchange and water relation were evaluated under full-season in situ infrared ( IR ) warming for hard red spring wheat ( Triticum aestivum L. cv . Yecora Rojo ) grown in an open field in a semiarid desert region of the southwest USA . A temperature free-air controlled enhancement ( T-FACE ) apparatus utilizing IR heater maintained canopy air temperature above 3.0 m Heated plot of wheat by 1.3 and 2.7 degree C ( 0.2 and 0.3 degree C below the targeted set-points of Reference plot with dummy heater ) during daytime and nighttime , respectively . Control plot had no apparatus . Every 6 week during 2007-2009 wheat wa sown under the three warming treatment ( i.e. , Control , Heated , Reference ) in three replicates in a 3 x 3 Latin square ( LSQ ) design on six planting during 4 month ( i.e. , January , March , September , December ) , or in a natural temperature variation treatment ( i.e. , Control ) in three replicates in a randomized complete block ( RCB ) design on nine planting during 7 month ( i.e. , January , February , April , June , July , August , October ) . Soil temperature ( T ( s ) ) and volumetric soil-water content ( theta ( s ) ) were 1.3 degree C warmer and 14 % lower in Heated compared with Reference plot , respectively . Other than a 1 % shading effect , no artifact on gas exchange or water relation were associated with the IR warming apparatus . IR warming increased carbon gain characteristic of an increase in metabolic rate to higher temperature that may have been attributed to the well-watered wheat crop and the supplemental irrigation that minimized plant-to-air water vapor pressure difference between IR-warmed and nonwarmed plot . Nevertheless , seasonal oscillation in the IR warming response on carbon gain occurred . IR warming decreased leaf water status and provided thermal protection during freeze event . IR warming is an effective experimental methodology to investigate the impact of global climate change on agronomic cropping and natural ecosystem to a wide range of natural and artificially imposed air temperature .

aVMitigation of enteric methane ( CH ( 4 ) ) emission in ruminant ha become an important area of research because accumulation of CH ( 4 ) is linked to global warming . Nutritional and microbial opportunity to reduce CH ( 4 ) emission have been extensively researched ; but little is known about using natural variation to breed animal with lower CH ( 4 ) yield . Measuring CH ( 4 ) emission rate directly from animal is difficult and hinders direct selection on reduced CH ( 4 ) emission . However , improvement can be made through selection on associated trait ( e.g . ; residual feed intake , RFI ) or through selection on CH ( 4 ) predicted from feed intake and diet composition . The objective wa to establish phenotypic and genetic variation in predicted CH ( 4 ) output , and to determine the potential of genetics to reduce methane emission in dairy cattle . Experimental data were used and record on daily feed intake ; weekly body weight , and weekly milk production were available from 548 heifer . Residual feed intake ( MJ/d ) is the difference between net energy intake and calculated net energy requirement for maintenance a a function of body weight and for fat- and protein-corrected milk production . Predicted methane emission ( PME ; g/d ) is 6 % of gross energy intake ( Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change methodology ) corrected for energy content of methane ( 55.65 kJ/g ) . The estimated heritabilities for PME and RFI were 0.35 and 0.40 , respectively . The positive genetic correlation between RFT and PME indicated that cow with lower RFI have lower PME ( estimate ranging from 0.18 to 0.84 ) . Hence , it is possible to decrease the methane production of a cow by selecting more-efficient cow ; and the genetic variation suggests that reduction in the order of 11 to 26 % in 10 yr are theoretically possible , and could be even higher in a genomic selection program . However , several uncertainty are discussed ; for example , the lack of true methane measurement ( and the key assumption that methane produced per unit feed is not affected by RFI level ) , a well a the limitation of predicting the biological consequence of selection . To overcome these limitation , an international effort is required to bring together data on feed intake and methane emission of dairy cow .

aVWe need every tool we can get our hand on in the fight against global warming ; a truly low-carbon liquid fuel is clearly a tool we can not give up lightly and arguably a tool we can not do without . Unfortunately , our current policy do not require or reward broadly sustainably and truly low-carbon biomass . What 's more , the small policy step forward are under atttack and the comprehensive policy solution are not even being debated . As a result , any supply estimate that doe not start by identifying the policy that would guide the market to choose sustainably managed feedstock in sustainable quantity can be nothing more than a proof of concept , technical assessment . These estimate are misleadingly high in the current policy climate . Nevertheless to stop global warming we must try to get the right policy in place and with an aggressive package of policy , they might actually turn out to be low . A modest proposal for a billion gallon challenge with rich incentive and rigorous environmental requirement ( perhaps building of voluntary sustainability certification standard such a the Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels ) is offered a a way to launch the advanced biofuels industry on the right track in a way will build public support .

aVThe recent rapid mass loss of mountain glacier in response to climate warming ha been reported for high and low latitude all over the Earth . The paper analysis and discus the recent evolution of a representative glacierized group within the Italian Alps , the Piazzi-DosdS , where small glacier are experiencing considerable retreat and shrinking . We analysed aerial photo to calculate area and geometry change in the time window 1954-2003 , and glaciological and geomorphological survey were also performed . The estimated area change during 1954-2003 wa -3.97 km ( 2 ) ( -51 % of the area coverage in 1954 ) . Area reduction increased more recently : area change during 1991-2003 ( 12 year ) wa -1.74 km ( 2 ) , against -0.67 km ( 2 ) during 1981-1991 ( 10 year ) , and -1.57 km ( 2 ) during 1954-1981 ( 27 year ) . Moreover , analysis of the most recent orthophotos acquired during the summer of 2003 under exceptional condition ( i.e . total absence of snow cover ) allowed observation and mapping of change affecting glacier shape and morphology , including growing rock outcrop , tongue separation , formation of proglacial lake , increasing supraglacial debris and collapse structure . Such process cause positive feedback that accelerate further glacier disintegration once they appear . From a geodynamical perspective , the DosdS Piazzi is now experiencing transition from a glacial system to a paraglacial one ; area where in the past the shaping and driving factor were glacier are now subject to the action of melting water , slope evolution and periglacial process .

aVTransport today is mostly sustained by liquid fossil fuel , despite the fact that the invention of the combustion engine started with biofuels . However , known environmental impact and the instability of the fossil-fuel market have revived the status of biofuels . Some concern have appeared regarding how emerging global climate change will affect biofuels ' feedstock production , since agriculture is strongly dependent on climate variable . Therefore , numerical model were introduced to calculate how temperature and precipitation could affect crop production for biodiesel and bioethanol production . Furthermore , 4 scenario projected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change were put into the calculation . The result show that temperature ha significant impact on feedstock production in all case ( P < 0.05 ) , while precipitation seems to be le significant . If the temperature increase by 6.4 degree C a the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts , production of bioethanol made from sugar beet will decrease by a much a 70 % . For other feedstock , the share of production decrease will be smaller . Only biodiesel made of soybean will be positively affected by a temperature increase . Since global climate change will have negative impact on feedstock for biofuel production , it is a challenge to meet the projected increase in biofuels ' share in the fuel market .

aVTens of million of people around the world are already exposed to coastal flooding from tropical cyclone . Global warming ha the potential to increase hurricane flooding , both by hurricane intensification and by sea level rise . In this paper , the impact of hurricane intensification and sea level rise are evaluated using hydrodynamic surge model and by considering the future climate projection of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change . For the Corpus Christi , Texas , United States study region , mean projection indicate hurricane flood elevation ( meteorologically generated storm surge plus sea level rise ) will , on average , rise by 0.3 m by the 2030s and by 0.8 m by the 2080s . For catastrophic-type hurricane surge event , flood elevation are projected to rise by a much a 0.5 m and 1.8 m by the 2030s and 2080s , respectively .

aVCarbon emission reduction scheme by improving residential building energy performance are often developed and assessed upon the assumption of current or stationary climate . This study investigated the heating and cooling ( H-C ) energy requirement and corresponding carbon emission of residential house in different climatic condition in relation to global warming . This included assessing and quantifying the efficacy of emission reduction scheme based on emission reduction capacity ( ERG ) . ERC represents the percentage of projected carbon emission reduction under changing climate in a specific year compared to the expected reduction by a scheme at current or stationary climate . It is shown that in a heating-dominated region with a cold climate or temperate climate with cold winter , ERC is projected to increase ( or the projected emission reduction is higher than the expected reduction under the emission reduction scheme ) in the presence of global warming . In contrast , in a cooling-dominated region with a hot dry or hot humid climate or an H-C balanced temperate climate , ERC is projected to decline . This implies that emission reduction will be lower than those initially targeted by the emission reduction scheme without consideration of global warming . Additionally , to reflect the changing carbon emission over year due to climate change , the average emission reduction capacity ( AERC ) wa also proposed for the assessment of reduction scheme . It wa concluded that the design and assessment of carbon emission reduction scheme for residential building need to move beyond it assumption of a current or stationary climate to take into account climate change impact .

aVWhile many study of the effect of global warming on hurricane predict an increase in various metric of Atlantic basin-wide activity , it is le clear that this signal will emerge from background noise in measure of hurricane damage , which depend largely on rare , high-intensity landfalling event and are thus highly volatile compared to basin-wide storm metric . Using a recently developed hurricane synthesizer driven by large-scale meteorological variable derived from global climate model , 1000 artificial 100-yr time series of Atlantic hurricane that make landfall along the U. S. Gulf and East Coasts are generated for four climate model and for current climate condition a well a for the warmer climate of 100 yr hence under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) emission scenario A1b . These synthetic hurricane damage a portfolio of insured property according to an aggregate wind-damage function ; damage from flooding is not considered here . Assuming that the hurricane climate change linearly with time , a 1000-member ensemble of time series of property damage wa created . Three of the four climate model used produce increasing damage with time , with the global warming signal emerging on time scale of 40 , 113 , and 170 yr , respectively . It is pointed out , however , that probability of damage increase significantly well before such emergence time scale and it is shown that probability density distribution of aggregate damage become appreciably separated from those of the control climate on time scale a short a 25 yr. For the fourth climate model , damage decrease with time , but the signal is weak .

aVMost refrigerant used today are potent chlorofluorocarbon ( CFC ) , hydrochlorofluorocarbon ( HCFC ) , and hydrofluorocarbon ( HFC ) , greenhouse gas ( GHG ) that can contribute significantly to anthropogenic climate change and stratospheric ozone depletion . In a business-as-usual scenario , HFC emission in 2050 have been predicted to be equivalent to 9-19 % ( CO ( 2 ) -eq . basis ) of projected global CO ( 2 ) emission . This percentage increase to 28-45 % if projected CO ( 2 ) emission result in a 450-ppm CO ( 2 ) stabilization scenario . Half of current direct HFC emission are from mobile air conditioning ( MAC ) and alternative refrigerant with lower global warming potential ( GWP ) should have higher energy efficiency . The European f-Gas Directive phase out the use of refrigerant with GWP > 150 , including HFC-134a ( GWP = 1430 ) from MACs by 2017 . Life-Cycle Climate Performance ( LCCP ) identifies environmentally superior technology to minimize GHG emission from refrigeration and air conditioning application . The comprehensive LCCP model , GREEN-MAC-LCCP ( c ) focus on the current choice among alternative refrigerant that meet the f-Gas requirement starting in 2011 . Using GREEN-MAC-LCCP ( c ) we estimate that the current MAC technology based on HFC-134a refrigerant demand additional fuel during vehicle A/C operation in the : USA by 7 % , in the EU by 7 % , in Japan by 9 % , in India by 15-20 % , and in China by 7-10 % depending on the humidity . We compare these data with the projected LCCP CO ( 2 ) -eq . saving by the year 2017 when HFC-134a will be replaced by a low GWP alternative ( GWP < 150 ) according to the f-Gas rule . We find that refrigerant HFO-1234yf ha the potential to reduce global LCCP CO ( 2 ) -eq . greenhouse gas emission by about 7 % in 2017 , whereas greenhouse gas emission from air conditioning system using R-744 ( carbon dioxide ) refrigerant are estimated to be about 2 % greater , compared to the current HFC-134a MAC baseline system .

aVCarbon dioxide and methane are major compound involved in global warming . The process of CO ( 2 ) and CH ( 4 ) molecule absorption by water cluster wa investigated by the molecular dynamic method . The frequency spectrum of dielectric permittivity for system consisting of ( H ( 2 ) O ) ( n ) , ( CO ( 2 ) ) ( i ) ( H ( 2 ) O ) ( 10 ) and ( CH ( 4 ) ) ( i ) ( H ( 2 ) O ) ( 10 ) cluster mixed in various proportion were determined . The IR radiation absorption spectrum of these system were calculated and compared . Also , the radiating power of these system wa established . The capture of greenhouse gas ' molecule by ultra disperse water medium reduces the ability of the medium to absorb the Earth 's radiation , i.e. , it reduces the greenhouse effect .

aVThe conversion of native forest by cutting and burning into farming area lead to alteration in the dynamic of soil organic matter , with change in emission of greenhouse gas ( GHGs : CO ( 2 ) , CH ( 4 ) and N ( 2 ) O ) from the biosphere to the atmosphere . These cause an average temperature rise and , consequently , global climate change . The aim of this study wa to examine relationship between the flux of CO ( 2 ) , CH ( 4 ) and N ( 2 ) O with moisture , microbial biomass and inorganic N form in soil with different land us in the Cerrado biome ( Rio Verde county , State of Goias - Brazil ) . The climate ( Koppen-Geiger ) wa classified a Aw and the soil a Latossolo Vermelho distrofico caulinitico I a clayey kaolinitic Oxisol under original Cerrado ( Brazilian savanna ) vegetation . The experiment wa arranged in a completely randomized design ( CRD ) with four treatment ( area ) : Native vegetation - Cerrado ( CE ) ; brachiaria pasture ( PA ) ; soybean in conventional tillage ( SC ) and no-tillage ( NT ) corn followed by millet . No significant difference in annual CO ( 2 ) and N ( 2 ) O emission were observed between treatment . This can be explained by the variability of gas flux due to climate seasonality , with lower emission in the winter due to low soil moisture . Mean emission of CO ( 2 ) were 108.9 +/- 85.6 mu g m ( -2 ) h ( -1 ) , and N ( 2 ) O 13.5 +/- 7.6 mu g m ( -2 ) h ( -1 ) . For CH ( 4 ) significant difference in the flux were only observed in pasture ( 32 mu g m ( -2 ) h ( -1 ) ) , while in the other area inflow between 46 and 15 mu g m ( -2 ) h ( -1 ) were observed . The GHG flux showed close correlation with soil moisture . The N-NO ( 3 ) ( - ) emission were significantly correlated with CO ( 2 ) -emissions in all area . Considering all treatment together , the three GHG flux were correlated with the microbial C and N content . However , the Cmicro : Nmicro ratio wa not significantly correlated with the GHG flux . Only for pasture the CO ( 2 ) and N ( 2 ) O flux were correlated with the content of soil inorganic-N . Results suggested that the GHG flux in the Cerrado are related to rainfall , mainly in farming area treated with high fertilizer close to increase productivity .

aVAnaerobic digester provide clean , renewable energy ( biogas ) by converting organic waste to methane , and are a key part of China 's comprehensive rural energy plan . Here , experimental and modeling result are used to quantify the net greenhouse gas ( GHG ) reduction from substituting a household anaerobic digester for traditional energy source in Sichuan , China . Tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy and radial plume mapping were used to estimate the mass flux of fugitive methane emission from active digester . Using household energy budget , the net improvement in GHG emission associated with biogas installation wa estimated using global warming commitment ( GWC ) a a consolidated measure of the warming effect of GHG emission from cooking . In all scenario biogas household had lower GWC than nonbiogas household , by a much a 54 % . Even biogas household with methane leakage exhibited lower GWC than nonbiogas household , by a much a 48 % . Based only on the averted GHG emission over 10 year , the monetary value of a biogas installation wa conservatively estimated at US $ 28.30 ( $ 16.07 ton ( -1 ) CO ( 2 ) .eq ) , which is available to partly offset construction cost . The interaction of biogas installation program with policy supporting improved stove , renewable harvesting of biomass , and energy intervention with substantial health cobenefits are discussed .

aVThe application of inorganic nitrogen ( N ) fertilizer strongly influence the contribution of agriculture to the greenhouse effect , especially by potentially increasing emission of nitrous oxide ( N ( 2 ) O ) , carbon dioxide ( CO ( 2 ) ) and methane ( CH ( 4 ) ) from soil . The present microcosm-study investigates the effect of different form of inorganic N fertilizer on greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emission from two different agricultural soil . The relationship between greenhouse gas emission and soil microbial community , N transformation rate and plant ( Hordeum vulgare L. cv . Morex ) growth were investigated . Repeated N fertilization led to increased N ( 2 ) O emission . In a parallel survey of functional microbial population dynamic we observed a stimulation of bacterial and archaeal ammonia oxidiser accompanied with these N ( 2 ) O emission . The ratio of archaeal to bacterial ammonium monooxygenase subunit A ( amoA ) gene copy ( data obtained from Inselsbacher et al. , 2010 ) correlated positively with N ( 2 ) O flux , which suggests a direct or indirect involvement of archaea in N ( 2 ) O flux . Repeated N fertilization also stimulated methane oxidation , which may also be related to a stimulation of ammonia oxidizer . The fertilizer effect differed between soil type : In the more organic Niederschleinz soil N-turnover rate increased more strongly after fertilization , while in the sandy Purkersdorf soil plant growth and soil respiration were accelerated depending on fertilizer N type . Compared to addition of NH ( 4 ) ( + ) and NO ( 3 ) ( - ) , addition of NH ( 4 ) NO ( 3 ) fertilizer resulted in the largest increase in global warming potential a a summary indicator of all GHG related effect . This effect resulted from the strongest increase of both N ( 2 ) O and CO ( 2 ) emission while plant growth wa not equally stimulated , compared to e.g . KNO ( 3 ) fertilization . In order to decrease N loss from agricultural ecosystem and in order to minimize soil derived global warming potential , this study point to the need for interdisciplinary investigation of the highly complex interaction within plant-soil-microbe-atmosphere system . By understanding the microbial process underlying fertilizer effect on GHG emission the N use efficiency of crop could be refined .

aVThe housing sector is a major consumer of energy . Studies on the future energy demand under climate change which also take into account future change of the building stock , renovation measure and heating system are still lacking . We provide the first analysis of the combined effect of these four influencing factor on the future energy demand for room conditioning of residential building and resulting greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emission in Germany until 2060 . We show that the heating energy demand will decrease substantially in the future . This shift will mainly depend on the number of renovated building and climate change scenario and only slightly on demographic change . The future cooling energy demand will remain low in the future unless the amount of air conditioner strongly increase . As a strong change in the German energy mix is not expected , the future GHG emission caused by heating will mainly depend on the energy demand for future heating . ( C ) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

aVIn order to examine the potential interactive pressure of local pollution and global climate change , we exposed coral and crustose coralline algae ( CCA ) to three agricultural photosystem II ( PSII ) herbicide at four temperature ( 26-32 degree C ) . The coral Acropora millepora wa 3- to 10-fold more sensitive to the three herbicide than the CCA Neogoniolithon fosliei . While the photosynthesis of CCA wa not affected by the herbicide concentration used ( < 1 mu g L ( -1 ) ) , temperature of 31 degree C and 32 degree C alone significantly inhibited photosynthetic efficiency ( Delta F : F ( m ) ' ) and caused chronic photoinhibition ( reduced F ( v ) : F ( m ) ) and substantial bleaching . Environmentally relevant concentration of each herbicide increased the negative effect of thermal stress on coral at 31 degree C and 32 degree C. Mixed model analysis of variance showed that the effect of elevated sea surface temperature ( SST ) and herbicide on photosynthetic efficiency of coral symbionts were additive . Furthermore , the effect of either diuron or atrazine in combination with higher SST ( 31 degree C and 32 degree C ) on chronic photoinhibition wa distinctly greater than additive ( synergistic ) . Reducing the herbicide concentration by 1 mu g L-1 diuron above 30 degree C would protect photosynthetic efficiency by the equivalent of 1.8 degree C and reduce chronic photoinhibition by the equivalent of a 1 degree C reduction . Reduced water quality increase the vulnerability of coral to elevated SSTs , and effective management of local water quality can reduce negative effect of global stressor such a elevated SST .

aVClimate change is expected to result in an increased occurrence of heat stress . The long-term population-level impact of this stress would be lessened in population able to genetically adapt to higher temperature . Adaptation requires the presence of genetically-based variation . At-risk population may undergo strong decline in population size that lower the amount of genetic variation . The objective of this study were to quantify the heritability of heat tolerance in population of the least killifish , Heterandria formosa , and to determine if heritabilities were reduced following a population bottleneck . Heritabilities of heat tolerance were determined for two line of each of two source population ; two bottlenecked line ( established with one pair of fish ) and two regular line . Heat tolerance wa quantified a temperature-at-death ( TAD ) , when fish acclimated at 28A degree C were subjected to an increase in water temperature of 2A degree C/day . Mid-parent/mean offspring regression and full-sib analysis were used to estimate the heritability of TAD . Heritability estimate from parent/offspring regression ranged from 0.185 to 0.462 , while those from sib analysis ranged from 0 to 0.324 , with an overall estimate of 0.203 ( 0.230 for the regular line , 0.168 for bottlenecked one ) . Fish from the bottlenecked line from one source population ( but not the other ) had a lower heritability than did those from the regular line . These result show that the population tested had some potential for adaptation to elevated water temperature , and that this potential may be reduced following a population bottleneck . This should not be construed a evidence that natural population will not suffer negative consequence from global warming ; this study only showed that these specific population have some potential to adapt under a very specific set of condition .

aVGlobal climate change is expected to trigger northward shift in the range of natural population of plant and animal , with subsequent effect on intraspecific genetic diversity . Investigating how genetic diversity is patterned among population that arose following the last Ice Age is a promising method for understanding the potential future effect of climate change . Theoretical and empirical work ha suggested that overall genetic diversity can decrease in colonial population following rapid expansion into postglacial landscape , with potential negative effect on the ability of population to adapt to new environmental regime . The crucial measure of this genetic variation and a population 's overall adaptability is the heritable variation in phenotypic trait , a it is this variation that mediates the rate and direction of a population 's multigenerational response to selection . Using two large full-sib quantitative genetic study ( N ( Manitoba ) = 144 ; N ( South Dakota ) = 653 ) and a smaller phenotypic analysis from Kansas ( N ( Kansas ) = 44 ) , we compared mean level of pigmentation , genetic variation and heritability in three pigmentation trait among population of the common garter snake , Thamnophis sirtalis , along a north-south gradient , including a postglacial northern population and a putative southern refuge population . Counter to our expectation , we found that genetic variance and heritability for the three pigmentation trait were the same or higher in the postglacial population than in the southern population .

aVLand-use change and water resource management increasingly impact stream and river temperature and therefore aquatic organism . Efforts at thermal mitigation are expected to grow in future decade . Yet the biological consequence of both human thermal impact and proposed mitigation option are poorly quantified . This study provides such context for river thermal management in two way . First , we summarize the full spectrum of human thermal impact to help thermal manager consider the relative magnitude of all impact and mitigation option . Second , we synthesize biological sensitivity to river temperature shift using thermal performance curve , which relate organism-level biological process to temperature . This approach supplement the popular use of thermal threshold by directly estimating the impact of temperature shift on the rate of key biological process ( e.g. , growth ) . Our result quantify a diverse array of human thermal impact , revealing that human action tend to increase more than decrease river temperature . Our result also provide a practical framework in which to quantify the sensitivity of river organism to such impact and related mitigation option . Finally , among the data and study we synthesized , river organism appear to be more sensitive to temperature above than below their thermal maximum , and fish are more sensitive to temperature change than invertebrate .

aVWe monitored breeding bird community and vegetation both before and after Hurricane Katrina category 2 wind severely damaged extensive bottomland hardwood forest of the Pearl River basin , south Louisiana . Many tree were felled by wind , most others were stripped of leaf and branch , and the canopy opened considerably ( 57 % ) . Blackberry thicket sprouted and expanded to cover almost all of what wa previously a patchily open forest understory . The bird community changed distinctively following the hurricane , driven primarily by increased density of specie that prefer dense understory ( regenerating ) habitat . Individual specie that increased significantly in density included one year-round resident , Carolina wren , and five breeding migrant , white-eyed vireo , Swainson 's warbler , Kentucky warbler , hooded warbler , and yellow-breasted chat . These pattern were predictable response to the opened canopy and increased density of understory vegetation . However , over three year following the storm , most specie , especially canopy breeder , showed no distinct numerical response to the hurricane , which suggests that the initial bird community wa resistant to hurricane disturbance . Only one specie . Acadian flycatcher , declined significantly after the hurricane , presumably because of loss of it preferred open understory breeding and feeding habitat . Our result thus document and reinforce the important role hurricane play along the Gulf coast in structuring forest bird community by altering understory habitat . We expect habitat change will continue a invasive plant specie further change forest community structure , and a large storm increase in frequency in relation to global climate change . Thus , we also expect continued change to the bird community , which may include additional future decline . ( C ) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All right reserved .

aVAlthough it account for only 4.2 % of the total global warming potential , aviation-generated CO ( 2 ) is projected to grow to approximately 5.7 % by 2050 , faster than any other sector . Rapidly emerging fuel-cell-based technology could be developed for future replacement of onboard electrical system in larger more-electric or all-electric aircraft . The Environmentally Friendly Inter City Aircraft Powered by Fuel Cells project , led by Politecnico di Torino in the Sixth Framework Programme , ha carried out a feasibility study on all-electric intercity aircraft to provide a preliminary definition of new form of aircraft system that can be obtained by fuel cell technology . Solid oxide fuel cell system could be advantageous for some aeronautical application , due to their capability of accepting hydrocarbon fuel with lower pollutant effect ( e.g. , natural gas ) , especially sustainable biofuels such a second-generation bioethanol . In this paper , the design of a hybrid solid oxide fuel cell and micro gas turbine energy system , a well a the simulation of complete mission of a regional jet , ha been performed . The system will be discussed in two fuel configuration , natural gas and bioethanol , and the difference in the system structure and regulation will be discussed . Preliminary estimation on size and weight of these new system have been carried out . The obtained result are discussed .

aVThe climate system is a prototypical nonlinear complex system exhibiting nonstationary temporal variation and complicated spatial pattern . One of the ideal location for studying climate system is the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau ( QTP ) , which is considered an amplifier of global climate change . In this study , recurrence quantification analysis ( RQA ) wa used to analyze the annual temperature series of 17 station in different climate zone of the QTP , based on station observation data of daily temperature ( minimum , maximum and mean ) from 1961 to 2008 . Spatial pattern and variation of RQA index of Determinism ( DET ) and Kolmogorov ( K ( 2 ) ) entropy suggested that there are marked difference in temperature pattern in the QTP . Correlation analysis between RQA index of temperature series and environmental factor , such a topographical variation and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index suggest that both the source and effect of climate complexity are nonlinear . Results of this study indicate that RQA measurement wa indeed an efficient approach to analyze the dynamic of a climate system .

aVHigh biological productivity combined with the poor ventilation produce severe oxygen depletion ( hypoxia ) in upper intermediate water of the Arabian Sea . The naturally developed Arabian Sea oxygen minimum zone ( OMZ ) is one of the most pronounced low oxygen ocean environment known today . The OMZ impinges the Indian margin where oxygen concentration reach value le than 0.05 ml/l leading denitrification . In recent study , it ha been observed that the OMZ strength ha varied considerably in the past , in tune with the global climate change . But the effect of change in natural mid-water hypoxic environment on the marine biota particularly of the eastern Arabian Sea is unknown . Here , we analyzed 30,000 yr record of temporal change in two major group of marine calcifying microfauna pteropods secreting aragonitic shell and foraminifera secreting calcitic shell in term of abundance and diversity variation . This study will provide an insight into our understanding of potential impact of rising atmospheric CO ( 2 ) on marine ecosystem .

aVSurface air temperature ( SAT ) over the globe , particularly the Northern Hemisphere continent , ha rapidly risen over the last 2-3 decade , leading to an abrupt shift toward a warmer climate state after 1997/98 . Whether the terrestrial warming might be caused by local response to increasing greenhouse gas ( GHG ) concentration or by sea surface temperature ( SST ) rise is recently in dispute . The SST warming itself may be driven by both the increasing GHG forcing and slowly varying natural process . Besides , whether the recent global warming might affect seasonal-to-interannual climate predictability is an important issue to be explored . Based on the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology ( JAMSTEC ) climate prediction system in which only observed SSTs are assimilated for coupled model initialization , the present study show that the historical SST rise play a key role in driving the intensified terrestrial warming over the globe . The SST warming trend , while negligible for short lead prediction , ha substantial impact on the climate predictability at long lead time ( > 1 yr ) particularly in the extratropics . The tropical climate predictability , however , is little influenced by global warming . Given a perfect warming trend and/or a perfect model , global SAT and precipitation could be predicted beyond two year in advance with an anomaly correlation skill above similar to 0.6 . Without assimilating ocean subsurface observation , model initial condition show a strong spurious cooling drift of subsurface temperature ; this is caused by large negative surface heat flux damping arising from the SST-nudging initialization . The spurious subsurface cooling drift act to weaken the initial SST warming trend during model forecast , leading to even negative trend of global SAT and precipitation at long lead time and hence deteriorating the global climate predictability . Concerning the important influence of the subsurface temperature on the global SAT trend , future effort are required to develop a good scheme for assimilating subsurface information particularly in the extratropical ocean .

aVThe present work considers the impact of hydrogen fuel on the environment within the cycle of it generation and combustion . Hydrogen ha been portrayed by the medium a a fuel that is environmentally clean because it combustion result in the formation of harmless water . However , hydrogen first must be generated . The effect of hydrogen generation on the environment depends on the production process and the related by-product . Hydrogen available on the market at present is mainly generated by using steam reforming of natural gas , which is a fossil fuel . Its by-product is CO ( 2 ) , which is a greenhouse gas and it emission result in global warming and climate change . Therefore , hydrogen generated from fossil fuel is contributing to global warming to the similar extent a direct combustion of the fossil fuel . On the other hand hydrogen obtained from renewable energy , such solar energy , is environmentally clean during the cycle of it generation and combustion . Consequently , the introduction of hydrogen economy must be accompanied by the development of hydrogen that is environmentally friendly . The present work considers several aspect related to the generation and utilisation of hydrogen obtained by steam reforming and solar energy conversion ( solar-hydrogen ) .

aVClimate change , sea level rise , over-pumping and saltwater intrusion present some of the future challenge of water resource management in coastal area . Over-abstraction is considered one of the main cause of seawater intrusion and the rise in sea level accelerates the intrusion . With the combined impact of sea level rise and over-pumping the problem becomes exacerbated and requires urgent solution . Previous study have mainly focused on the study of impact of sea level rise or over-abstraction on seawater intrusion separately and their combined effect have not been studied in the literature . This paper present application of a coupled transient density-dependent finite element model to simulate seawater intrusion in coastal aquifer and investigates the individual and combined effect of likely sea level rise and over-pumping on seawater intrusion . Three scenario are considered : rise in sea level due to climate change , decline in groundwater table due to over-pumping and combination of sea level rise and over-pumping . The result show that , in the case study considered in this paper , the rise in the sea level moved the transition zone inland by about 5 % . However , the combination of sea level rise and over-pumping resulted in further inland movement of the transition zone ( about 8 % ) . The amount of intrusion greatly depends on the depth , size and property of the aquifer . While the intrusion is a few metre in a small aquifer , it could be several kilometre in a large aquifer .

aVPrevious study have linked ongoing winter drought in southwest Western Australia ( SWWA ) to change in local , a well a large-area , sea-level pressure . Because the area of SWWA occupies only a few grid point of a typical global climate model ( GCM ) , it is difficult to infer the possible role of global climate change in the drought in SWWA . Since the Indian Ocean High is a robust and large scale feature of atmospheric general circulation , it is simulated qualitatively in all GCMs . A quantitative comparison of the simulated past change in it pressure and position in a GCM with those found in reanalysis data call be used to verify it suitability ill projecting future change in winter rainfall in southwest Western Australia . This paper examines the linkage between change in the Indian Ocean High and rainfall in SWWA , a well a a larger section of Western Australia . By introducing objective index for area-weighted pressure , the area-weighted latitude and longitude position of the High , this analysis show that winter rainfall in a large section of Western Australia and in SWWA is significantly correlated with longitudinal displacement of the Indian Ocean High . Rainfall in SWWA is also correlated with the area-averaged pressure of the High . A regression model of May to August rainfall in SWWA using the pressure and longitude of the Indian Ocean High a independent variable explains 52 per cent of the rainfall variance during 1951-2008 .

aVTemperate Australia is a global hotspot for marine biodiversity and it water have experienced well-above global average rate of ocean warming . We review the observed impact of climate change ( e.g . warming , ocean acidification , change in storm pattern ) on subtidal temperate coast in Australia and ass how these system are likely to respond to further change . Observed impact are region specific with the greatest number of specie response attributable to climate change reported in south-eastern Australia , where recent ocean warming ha been most pronounced . Here , a decline of giant kelp ( Macrocystis pyrifera ) and poleward range extension of a key herbivore ( sea urchin ) and other trophically important reef organism ha occurred . Although , evidence of change on other coastline around Australia is limited , we suggest that this is due to a lack of data rather than lack of change . Because of the east-west orientation of the south coast , most of Australia 's temperate water are found within a narrow latitudinal band , where any southward movement of isotherm is likely to affect specie across very large area . Future increase in temperature are likely to result in further range shift of macroalgae and associated specie , with range contraction and local extinction to be expected for specie that have their northern limit along the southern coastline . While there is currently no evidence of change attributable to non-temperature related climate impact , potentially due to a lack of long-term observational data , experimental evidence suggests that ocean acidification will result in negative effect on calcifying algae and animal . More importantly , recent experiment suggest the combined effect of climate change and non-climate stressor ( overharvesting , reduced water quality ) will lower the resilience of temperate marine community to perturbation ( e.g . storm , disease , and introduced specie ) , many of which are also predicted to increase in frequency and/or severity . Thus climate change is likely to , both by itself and in synergy with other stressor , impose change to southern Australian coastal specie , including important habitat-forming algae and the associated ecological functioning of temperate coast . Management of local and regional-scale stress may increase the resistance of temperate marine community to climate stressor and a such , provides an attractive tool for building resilience in temperate system .

aVThe current rate of warming due to increase in greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emission is very likely unprecedented over the last 10,000 y . Although the majority of country have adopted the view that global warming must be limited to 600 realization from climate model ensemble , we show that up to 86 % of terrestrial and 83 % of freshwater ecoregions will be exposed to average monthly temperature pattern > 2 SDs ( 2 sigma ) of the 1961-1990 baseline , including 82 % of critically endangered ecoregions . The entire range of 89 ecoregions will experience extreme monthly temperature with a local warming of < 2 degree C. Tropical and subtropical ecoregions , and mangrove , face extreme condition earliest , some with < 1 degree C warming . In contrast , few ecoregions within Boreal Forests and Tundra biome will experience such extreme this century . On average , precipitation regime do not exceed 2 of the baseline period , although considerable variability exists across the climate realization . Further , the strength of the correlation between seasonal temperature and precipitation change over numerous ecoregions . These result suggest many Global 200 ecoregions may be under substantial climatic stress by 2100 .

aVSimulations of present and future average regional ozone and PM ( 2.5 ) concentration over the United States were performed to investigate the potential impact of global climate change and emission on regional air quality using CMAQ . Various emission and climate condition with different biogenic emission and domain resolution were implemented to study the sensitivity of future air quality trend from the impact of changing biogenic emission . A comparison of GEOS-Chem and CMAQ wa performed to investigate the effect of downscaling on the prediction of future air quality trend . For ozone , the impact of global climate change are relatively smaller when compared to the impact of anticipated future emission reduction , except for the Northeast area , where increasing biogenic emission due to climate change have stronger positive effect ( increase ) to the regional ozone air quality . The combination effect from both climate change and emission reduction lead to approximately a 10 % or 5 ppbv decrease of the maximum daily average eight-hour ozone ( MDA8 ) over the Eastern United States . For PM ( 2.5 ) , the impact of global climate change have shown insignificant effect , where a the impact of anticipated future emission reduction account for the majority of overall PM ( 2.5 ) reduction . The annual average 24-h PM ( 2.5 ) of the future-year condition wa found to be about 40 % lower than the one from the present-year condition , of which 60 % of it overall reduction are contributed to by the decrease of SO ( 4 ) and NO ( 3 ) particulate matter . Changing the biogenic emission model increase the MDA8 ozone by about 5-10 % or 3-5 ppbv in the Northeast area . Conversely , it reduces the annual average PM ( 2.5 ) by 5 % or 1.0 mu g m ( -3 ) in the Southeast region .

aVThe objective of this study were : ( 1 ) to submit comprehensive information about the distinction among pan coefficient ( Kp ) , crop coefficient ( Kc ) , and crop-pan coefficient ( Kcp ) ; ( 2 ) to reveal the importance of using pan evaporation for irrigation scheduling . The amount of water allocated for agricultural production ha been decreasing due to rapid population growth , industrialization and contamination . Therefore , to obtain maximum yield and avoid excessive water application , the water requirement of the cultivated plant should be accurately determined , and irrigation water should be applied according to the need of the plant . Crop water consumption ( ETc ) varies from region to region depending on crop type , stage of growth , soil , and climate condition . Different evapotranspiration rate may be observed even in different part of the same region . Considering global warming and climate change in recent year , it is clear that the predicted ET value of a year can not be used safely for upcoming year . Research study have revealed a linear correlation between crop water consumption and the amount of water evaporated from open water surface . Therefore , irrigation scheduling through using the combination of proper crop-pan coefficient and pan evaporation ( Class-A pan ) is very important due to both ease of adjustment to the climate change and ease of application . Even though many study have been conducted on this issue , there is still need to collective and detailed information about use of evaporation pan for irrigation scheduling and above mentioned coefficient .

aVThe response of South Pacific Eastern Subtropical Mode Water ( SPESTMW ) to global warming is investigated by comparing solution from a set of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) Fourth Assessment Report ( AR4 ) coupled model between a present-day climate and a future , warmer climate . Under the warmer climate scenario , the SPESTMW extends southwestward and is significantly increased in volume . This is because all the local surface forcing mechanism ( i.e. , wind stress , heat and freshwater flux ) in the eastern subtropical South Pacific tends to de-stratify the upper ocean and thus deepen the mixed layer . Further , a suite of process-oriented experiment with an ocean general circulation model suggest that it is the intensified southeast trade wind under the warmer climate that promotes more heat flux from the ocean into the atmosphere that then result in a deepening of the mixed layer in the eastern subtropics of the South Pacific .

aVOne of the basic condition for the operation of nuclear installation is security operation . The complexity of the phenomenon in heavy water detritiation plant , determine the use of advanced equipment for technological process involved . Pilot Plant for Tritium and Deuterium Separation developed the cryogenic technology of tritium separation from tritiated heavy water . The process is based on an catalyzed isotopic exchange module , where the tritium is extracted from tritiated heavy water . An important process in this way is to extract moisture from the wet hydrogen gas coming from the exchange column . This process take place on two phase : extracting moisture from the gas resulting from isotopic exchange column on the primary system consists of a fully automated chiller ; cleaning system on molecular sieve adsorbent . The refrigeration system ( chiller system ) used Freon a refrigerant . Refrigerants are working fluid in any refrigeration system . They absorb heat from one source and send it to another source , usually through evaporation and condensation process due to phase change . Chlorofluorocarbons - CFCs and hydrochlorofluorocarbon HCFCs were developed a a series of non-toxic refrigerant , stable ( at normal temperature ) that belong to a larger family of substance known a halogen . These refrigerant contained , amongst other element , like chlorine . Refrigerants known a CFC12 ( R12 ) and HCFC22 ( R22 ) are stable , remaining in the atmosphere for many year , and eventually diffuse into the stratosphere . In the upper atmosphere the molecule of refrigerant with chlorine can destroys the ozone layer . In the lower atmosphere the molecule absorbs infrared radiation and contribute to global warming . Paper try to meet the safety of the operation requirement of nuclear facility , technological performance of work required by the thermodynamic condition but also environmental protection a an important factor in sustainable development of society .

aVThe application of pyrogenic carbon , biochar , to agricultural soil is currently discussed a a win-win strategy to sequester carbon in soil , thus improving soil fertility and mitigate global warming . Our aim wa to investigate if biochar may improve plant eco-physiological response under sufficient water supply a well a moderate drought stress . A fully randomized greenhouse study wa conducted with the pseudo-cereal Chenopodium quinoa Willd , using three level of biochar addition ( 0 , 100 and 200 t ha ( -1 ) ) to a sandy soil and two water treatment ( 60 % and 20 % of the water holding capacity of the control ) , investigating growth , water use efficiency , eco-physiological parameter and greenhouse gas ( GHG ) flux . Biochar application increased growth , drought tolerance and leaf-N- and water-use efficiency of quinoa despite larger plant-leaf area . The plant growing in biochar-amended soil accumulated exactly the same amount of nitrogen in their larger leaf biomass than the control plant , causing significantly decreased leaf N- , proline- and chlorophyll-concentrations . In this regard , plant response to biochar closely resembled those to elevated CO ( 2 ) . However , neither soil- nor plant-soil-respiration wa higher in the larger plant , indicating le respiratory C loss per unit of biomass produced . Soil-N ( 2 ) O emission were significantly reduced with biochar . The large application rate of 200 t ha ( -1 ) biochar did not improve plant growth compared to 100 t ha ( -1 ) ; hence an upper beneficial level exists . For quinoa grown in a sandy soil , biochar application might hence provide a win-win strategy for increased crop production , GHG emission mitigation and soil C sequestration .

aVOstreopsis ovata is a benthic dinoflagellate that produce palytoxin and it analogue . Since the end of the 1990s , toxic bloom of O. ovata have been recorded in many tropical and temperate marine water . These bloom often kill benthic invertebrate and cause health problem for human . We hypothesize that increase in seawater temperature might induce these bloom . A strain of O. ovata isolated from the southern coast of Japan wa selected for study . O. ovata cell were exposed to 7 different temperature from 24 to 30 degree C for 30 d , and growth rate were noted . The specific growth rate wa found to be highest at 25 degree C , next highest at 24 degree C and lower at 26 , 28 , 27 , 30 and 29 degree C , in that order . The hypothesis that increased seawater temperature cause increase in growth rate wa thus not supported . The cell toxicity and car bohydrate production of O. ovata were highest at the temperature range that is optimal for cell growth . Increasesing sea surface temperature , a a result of global warming , is therefore not likely to have a substantial effect on the bloom formation and toxicity of this Japanese strain of O. ovata .

aVBrazil must comply with international quality standard and animal welfare requirement in order to maintain it position a world 's largest exporter of poultry meat . With the scenario of global climate change there is the forecast of occurrence of extreme event with characteristic of both excess cold and heat for several region of the country . This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of using image of infrared thermography to evaluate the loss of sensible heat in young broiler fed different dietary energy level . Twenty bird were reared in a house with appropriate brooding using infrared lamp . Birds were distributed in a completely randomized experimental into two treatment : T1 ( control diet with 2950 kcal ME/kg ( -1 ) ) , and T2 ( high-energy diet with 3950 kcal ME/kg ( -1 ) ) . Infrared thermographic image of the bird were recorded for four consecutive day . One bird wa randomly chosen per treatment , and had special image taken and analyzed . Average surface temperature of the body area wa calculated using the surface temperature recorded at 100 spot ( 50 at the front and 50 at the lateral side of the bird 's body ) . Mean surface temperature of the flock wa calculated recording 100 spot on the group of bird . Total radiant heat loss wa calculated based on the average data of surface temperature . The result indicated that the young broiler fed the high-energy diet presented a metabolic energy loss equivalent to 0.64 kcal h ( -1 ) , while the bird fed with the control diet lost 2.18 kcal h ( -1 ) . This finding confirms that oil supplementation to the diet reduces bird heat loss . The infrared camera wa able to record young broiler ' surface temperature variation when bird were fed diet with different energy content .

aVThe effect of root-zone temperature ( RZT ) on the ion uptake , distribution and interaction of 21 ( 11 essential and 10 non-essential ) element using Lotus japonicus were studied . After acclimation in hydroponics at ambient ( 25 degree C ) RZT for three week , seedling were exposed to sub-optimal ( 15 degree C and 20 degree C ) and ambient RZTs . After one week , plant were harvested and then growth and mineral element were analyzed . The highest shoot and root biomass wa at 25 degree C and lowest at 15 degree C RZT . In shoot , the highest concentration of all element , except for nickel ( Ni ) , were at 25 degree C RZT . At lower RZTs , the reduction in concentration were more evident especially for trace element and heavy metal . Except for magnesium ( Mg ) , the highest root concentration were at 15 degree C RZT for all essential element . Unlike other non-essential element , the highest cadmium ( Cd ) and cobalt ( Co ) concentration in root were at 25 degree C RZT . The shoot/root ratio of almost all element were affected by sub-optimal RZTs . Only manganese ( Mn ) and Co showed increased shoot/root ratio at sub-optimal RZTs ; and this ratio decreased for other element . Nickel in shoot and Mn , Co and Cd in root tended to be negatively correlated with most other element ( either , essential or non-essential ) in each respective organ . The present study showed that RZT significantly changed the ion profile of L. japonicus and suggests possible connection between global warming and phyto-accumulation of heavy metal , especially in temperate region , since most metal tended to accumulate in shoot at higher RZT .

aVAlthough there is little controversy about global warming , there is still a debate regarding whether global warming is mainly due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission . Many researcher strongly believe that global warming is mainly due to greenhouse gas emission . However , other scientist argue that the standard model overstate the importance of CO ( 2 ) emission . We propose a reduced-form regression-based test . With the temperature and CO ( 2 ) emission data from the U.S. , we find little evidence in support of the notion that recent global warming is mainly due to CO ( 2 ) emission . Our result , therefore , call for more research on the cause of recent global warming .

aV[ 1 ] Studies indicate that , historically , terrestrial ecosystem of the northern high-latitude region may have been responsible for up to 60 % of the global net land-based sink for atmospheric CO ( 2 ) . However , these region have recently experienced remarkable modification of the major driving force of the carbon cycle , including surface air temperature warming that is significantly greater than the global average and associated increase in the frequency and severity of disturbance . Whether Arctic tundra and boreal forest ecosystem will continue to sequester atmospheric CO ( 2 ) in the face of these dramatic change is unknown . Here we show the result of model simulation that estimate a 41 Tg C yr ( -1 ) sink in the boreal land region from 1997 to 2006 , which represents a 73 % reduction in the strength of the sink estimated for previous decade in the late 20th century . Our result suggest that CO ( 2 ) uptake by the region in previous decade may not be a strong a previously estimated . The recent decline in sink strength is the combined result of ( 1 ) weakening sink due to warming-induced increase in soil organic matter decomposition and ( 2 ) strengthening source from pyrogenic CO ( 2 ) emission a a result of the substantial area of boreal forest burned in wildfire across the region in recent year . Such change create positive feedback to the climate system that accelerate global warming , putting further pressure on emission reduction to achieve atmospheric stabilization target .

aVChickpea is the third most important pulse crop worldwide . Changes in cropping system that necessitate late planting , scope for expansion in rice fallow and the global warming are pushing chickpea to relatively warmer growing environment . Such change demand identification of variety resilient to warmer temperature . Therefore , the reference collection of chickpea germplasm , defined based on molecular characterization of global composite collection , wa screened for high temperature tolerance at two location in India ( Patancheru and Kanpur ) by delayed sowing and synchronizing the reproductive phase of the crop with the occurrence of higher temperature ( > = 35 degree C ) . A heat tolerance index ( HTI ) wa calculated using a multiple regression approach where grain yield under heat stress is considered a a function of yield potential and time to 50 % flowering . There were large and significant variation for HTI , phenology , yield and yield component at both the location . There were highly significant genotypic effect and equally significant G x E interaction for all the trait studied . A cluster analysis of the HTI of the two location yielded five cluster group a stable tolerant ( n = 18 ) , tolerant only at Patancheru ( n = 34 ) , tolerant only at Kanpur ( n = 23 ) , moderately tolerant ( n 120 ) and stable sensitive ( n = 82 ) . The pod number per plant and the harvest index explained > = 60 % of the variation in seed yield and > = 49 % of HTI at Kanpur and > = 80 % of the seed yield and > = 35 % of HTI at Patancheru , indicating that partitioning a a consequence of poor pod set is the most affected trait under heat stress . A large number of heat-tolerant genotype also happened to be drought tolerant .

aVAgricultural drainage is thought to alter greenhouse gas emission from temperate peatlands , with CH ( 4 ) emission reduced in favor of greater CO ( 2 ) loss . Attention ha largely focussed on C trace gas , and le is known about the impact of agricultural conversion on N ( 2 ) O or global warming potential . We report greenhouse gas flux ( CH ( 4 ) , CO ( 2 ) , N ( 2 ) O ) from a drained peatland in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta , California , USA currently managed a a rangeland ( that is , pasture ) . This ecosystem wa a net source of CH ( 4 ) ( 25.8 +/- A 1.4 mg CH ( 4 ) -C m ( -2 ) d ( -1 ) ) and N ( 2 ) O ( 6.4 +/- A 0.4 mg N ( 2 ) O-N m ( -2 ) d ( -1 ) ) . Methane flux were comparable to those of other managed temperate peatlands , whereas N ( 2 ) O flux were very high ; equivalent to flux from heavily fertilized agroecosystems and tropical forest . Ecosystem scale CH ( 4 ) flux were driven by `` hotspot '' ( drainage ditch ) that accounted for le than 5 % of the land area but more than 84 % of emission . Methane flux were unresponsive to seasonal fluctuation in climate and showed minimal temporal variability . Nitrous oxide flux were more homogeneously distributed throughout the landscape and responded to fluctuation in environmental variable , especially soil moisture . Elevated CH ( 4 ) and N ( 2 ) O flux contributed to a high overall ecosystem global warming potential ( 531 g CO ( 2 ) -C equivalent m ( -2 ) y ( -1 ) ) , with non-CO ( 2 ) trace gas flux offsetting the atmospheric `` cooling '' effect of photoassimilation . These data suggest that managed Delta peatlands are potentially large regional source of greenhouse gas , with spatial heterogeneity in soil moisture modulating the relative importance of each gas for ecosystem global warming potential .

aVWe reconstruct trend in ice volume and deep ocean temperature for the past 108 Myr , resolving variation on timescales of similar to 2 Myr and longer . We use a sea level record a a proxy for ice volume , a benthic foraminiferal Mg/Ca-bf record a a proxy for temperature , and a benthic foraminiferal d ( 18 ) O ( bf ) record a a proxy for both . This allows u to construct dual estimate of temperature and ice volume variation for the interval 10-60 Ma : extracting temperature from d ( 18 ) O ( bf ) by using sea level a a proxy for ice volume to constrain the d ( 18 ) O ( sw ) component , and extracting seawater d ( 18 ) O ( sw ) ( which reflects ice volume ) from d ( 18 ) O ( bf ) by using Mg/Ca-bf to constrain the temperature component . Each of these approach requires numerous assumption , but the range of plausible solution are concordant on timescales > 2 Myr and within an uncertainty of +/- 2 degree C temperature and +/- 0.4 part per thousand delta O-18 ( sw ) . The agreement between the two approach for the last 50 Myr provides empirical justification for the use of d ( 18 ) O ( bf ) , Mg/Ca-bf , and sea level record a robust climate proxy . Our reconstruction indicate difference between deep ocean cooling and continental ice growth in the late Cenozoic : cooling occurred gradually in the middle-late Eocene and late Miocene-Pliocene while ice growth occurred rapidly in the earliest Oligocene , middle Miocene , and Plio-Pleistocene . These difference are consistent with climate model that imply that temperature , set by the long-term CO2 equilibrium , should change only gradually on timescales > 2 Myr , but growth of continental ice sheet may be rapid in response to climate threshold due to feedback that are not yet fully understood .

aVLandfills receiving a mix of waste , including organic , have developed dramatically over the last 3-4 decade ; from open dump to engineered facility with extensive control on leachate and gas . The conventional municipal landfill will in most climate produce a highly contaminated leachate and a significant amount of landfill gas . Leachate control may include bottom liner and leachate collection system a well a leachate treatment prior to discharge to surface water . Gas control may include oxidizing top cover , gas collection system with flare or gas utilization system for production of electricity and heat . The importance of leachate and gas control measure in reducing the overall environmental impact from a conventional landfill wa assessed by life-cycle-assessment ( LCA ) . The direct cost for the measure were also estimated providing a basis for assessing which measure are the most cost-effective in reducing the impact from a conventional landfill . This wa done by modeling landfill ranging from a simple open dump to highly engineered conventional landfill with energy recovery in form of heat or electricity . The modeling wa done in the waste LCA model EASEWASTE . The result showed drastic improvement for most impact category . Global warming went from an impact of 0.1 person equivalent ( PE ) for the dump to -0.05 PE for the best design . Similar improvement were found for photochemical ozone formation ( 0.02 PE to 0.002 PE ) and stratospheric ozone formation ( 0.04 PE to 0.001 PE ) . For the toxic and spoiled groundwater impact category the trend is not a clear . The reason for this wa that the load to the environment shifted a more technology were used . For the dump landfill the main impact were impact for spoiled groundwater due to lack of leachate collection , 2.3 PE down to 0.4 PE when leachate is collected . However , at the same time , leachate collection cause a slight increase in eco-toxicity and human toxicity via water ( 0.007E to 0.013PE and 0.002 to 0.003 PE respectively ) . The reason for this is that even if the leachate is treated , slight amount of contaminant are released through emission of treated wastewater to surface water . The largest environmental improvement with regard to the direct cost of the landfill wa the capping and leachate treatment system . The capping , though very cheap to establish , gave a huge benefit in lowered impact , the leachate collection system though expensive gave large benefit a well . The other gas measure were found to give further improvement , for a minor increase in cost . ( C ) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVBiodiesel ha attracted considerable attention a a renewable , biodegradable , and nontoxic fuel and can contribute to solving the energy problem , significantly reducing the emission of gas which cause global warming . The first stage of this work wa to simulate different alternative process for producing biodiesel . The method used for the production of biodiesel is the transesterification of vegetable oil with an alcohol in the presence of a catalyst . The raw material used were palm oil and waste cooking oil . The second stage wa a life cycle analysis for all alternative under study , followed by an economic analysis for the alternative that present minor impact and which are more promising from an economic point of view . Finally , we proceeded to compare the different alternative from both the point of view of life cycle and economic analysis . The feasibility of all process wa proven and the biodiesel obtained had good specification . From the standpoint of life cycle analysis , the best alternative wa the process of alkaline catalysis with acid pretreatment for waste cooking oil . The economic analysis wa done to the previous mentioned process and to the process that us raw virgin oil . methanol , and sodium hydroxide . This process ha lower investment cost but the process of alkaline catalysis with acid pre-treatment , whose main raw material is waste oil , is much more profitable and ha le environmental impact .

aVThe replacement of fossil fuel by biomass in the power generation process is an important strategy promoted by the European Union ( EU ) . This is aimed at reducing the effect of climate change along with increased security of supply and diversification of energy source . Life cycle assessment ( LCA ) is an increasingly popular method for research due to the difficulty associated with environmental impact assessment . This technique is aimed at analysing and evaluating the environmental impact of material , product or service through the entire cycle of production . The paper present the application of an LCA study to ass the impact of energy crop on the environment . The aim of the study wa to compare the environmental impact of various crop used for biofuel production . We have estimated the potential global warming , acidification and eutrophication for crop from the lignocelluloses group ( willow , Miscanthus ) and traditional plant for Polish agriculture ( wheat , rapeseed , potato ) .

aVRecovering energy from waste is a useful strategy for integrated waste and energy management in an eco-industrial park ( EIP ) and give promising reduction of waste , total energy consumption and operation cost . In Jinqiao EIP , Pudong New Area , Shanghai , an industrial symbiosis , based on the energy recovery from municipal sewage sludge and re-refined oil , wa proposed in the central heat-supplying company of Jinqiao EIP . It is expected that hot off-gas or part of the steam from the central heat-supplying company could be used for sludge drying and used oil re-refining while the dried sludge and refined oil can be partial substitution for fossil fuel . For the purpose of assessing the environmental performance of this industrial symbiosis , life cycle assessment ( LCA ) wa used and different scenario were set up in this study to evaluate the Global warming Potential ( GWP ) , Acidification Potential ( AP ) , Eutrophication Potential ( EP ) , Human toxicity air ( HTA ) and Total Environmental Impact Potential ( TEIP ) of the system . Results indicate that when the substitute ratio of coal by sludge is 14 % , the proposed industrial symbiosis ha the least environmental impact . Compared with the current situation ( sludge is landfilled ) , co-combustion of dried sludge and re-refined oil with coal at optimal scale will release le CO ( 2 ) , CH ( 4 ) , NO.. N ( 2 ) O and CO , but more SO ( 2 ) , H ( 2 ) S , NH ( 3 ) , HCl , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( PAHs ) , non-methane volatile organic compound ( NMVOC ) and heavy metal .

aVA life cycle assessment of hydrotreated vegetable oil ( HVO ) biofuel wa performed . The study wa commissioned by Volvo Technology Corporation and Volvo Penta Corporation a part of an effort to gain a better understanding of the environmental impact of potential future biobased liquid fuel for car and truck . The life cycle includes production of vegetable oil from rape , oil palm or Jatropha , transport of the oil to the production site , production of the HVO from the oil , and combustion of the HVO . The functional unit of the study is 1 kWh energy out from the engine of a heavy-duty truck and the environmental impact category that are considered are global warming potential ( GWP ) , acidification potential ( AP ) , eutrophication potential ( EP ) and embedded fossil production energy . System expansion wa used to take into account byproduct from activity in the system ; this choice wa made partly to make this study comparable to result reported by other study . The result show that HVO produced from palm oil combined with energy production from biogas produced from the palm oil mill effluent ha the lowest environmental impact of the feedstock investigated in this report . HVO ha a significantly lower life cycle GWP than conventional diesel oil for all feedstock investigated , and a GWP that is comparable to result for e.g . rape methyl ester reported in the literature . The result show that emission from soil caused by microbial activity and leakage are the largest contributor to most environmental impact category , which is supported also by other study . Nitrous oxide emission from soil account for more than half of the GWP of HVO . Nitrogen oxide and ammonia emission from soil cause almost all of the life cycle EP of HVO and contribute significantly to the AP a well . The embedded fossil production energy wa shown to be similar to result for e.g . rape methyl ester from other study . A sensitivity analysis show that variation in crop yield and in nitrous oxide emission from microbial activity in soil can cause significant change to the result . ( C ) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

aVLubricants are used in numerous application in our society , for instance , a hydraulic fluid . When used in forestry , 60-80 % of these hydraulic fluid are released into the environment . This is one of the reason for the growing interest for developing and utilising hydraulic fluid with good environmental performance . Another driving force in the development of hydraulic fluid is to replace fossil product with renewable one . The aim of this paper is to investigate the environmental impact of two type of hydraulic fluid , one based on mineral oil and one on vegetable oil . The difference in environmental impact of using chemical or biocatalytic production method is also assessed . This life cycle assessment is from cradle-to-gate , including waste treatment . A complementary , laboratory , biodegradability test wa also performed . The functional unit is 1 l of base fluid for hydraulic fluid , and mass allocation is applied . A sensitivity analysis is performed to ass the impact of the energy used and of the allocation method . The impact category studied are primary energy consumption , global warming potential ( GWP ) , eutrophication potential ( EP ) , acidification potential ( AP ) , photooxidant creation potential ( POCP ) and biodegradability . The contribution to GWP and primary energy consumption wa higher for the mineral oil-based hydraulic fluid than the vegetable oil-based hydraulic fluid . The contribution to EP and AP were higher for the vegetable oil-based hydraulic fluid than the mineral oil-based one . The vegetable oil-based hydraulic fluid had better biodegradability than the one based on mineral oil . The impact of production method wa minor , thus the biocatalytic method give no significant advantage over chemical method concerning energy and environmental performance . For the environmental impact category GWP , POCP and primary energy consumption , hydraulic fluid based on rapeseed oil make a lower contribution than a mineral oil-based hydraulic fluid . For EP and AP , the contribution of TMP oleate are higher than the contribution of mineral oil-based hydraulic fluid . The difference between the chemically catalysed method and the ezymatically catalysed method is negligible because the major environmental impact is due to the production of the raw material . The vegetable oil-based hydraulic fluid , TMP oleate , wa more biodegradable than the mineral oil-based hydraulic fluid .

aVHybrid life cycle assessment ha been used to ass the environmental impact of natural gas combined cycle ( NGCC ) electricity generation with carbon dioxide capture and storage ( CCS ) . The CCS chain modeled in this study consists of carbon dioxide ( CO ( 2 ) ) capture from flue gas using monoethanolamine ( MEA ) , pipeline transport and storage in a saline aquifer . Results show that the sequestration of 90 % CO ( 2 ) from the flue gas result in avoiding 70 % of CO ( 2 ) emission to the atmosphere per kWh and reduces global warming potential ( GWP ) by 64 % . Calculation of other environmental impact show the trade-off : an increase of 43 % in acidification , 35 % in eutrophication , and 120-170 % in various toxicity impact . Given the assumption employed in this analysis , emission of MEA and formaldehyde during capture process and generation of reclaimer waste contributes to various toxicity potential and cause many-fold increase in the on-site direct freshwater ecotoxicity and terrestrial ecotoxicity impact . NO ( x ) from fuel combustion is still the dominant contributor to most direct impact , other than toxicity potential and GWP . It is found that the direct emission of MEA contribute little to human toxicity ( HT < 1 % ) , however it make 16 % of terrestrial ecotoxicity impact . Hazardous reclaimer waste cause significant freshwater and marine ecotoxicity impact . Most increase in impact are due to increased fuel requirement or increased investment and operating input . The reduction in GWP range from 58 % to 68 % for the worst-case to best-case CCS system . Acidification , eutrophication and toxicity potential show an even large range of variation in the sensitivity analysis . Decreases in energy use and solvent degradation will significantly reduce the impact in all category . ( C ) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVIn the current scenario of depleting energy resource , increasing food insecurity and global warming , Jatropha ha emerged a a promising energy crop for India . The aim of this study is to examine the life cycle energy balance for Jatropha biodiesel production and greenhouse gas emission from post-energy use and end combustion of biodiesel , over a period of 5 year . It 's a case specific study for a small scale , high input Jatropha biodiesel system . Most of the existing study have considered low input Jatropha biodiesel system and have used NEB ( Net energy balance i.e . difference of energy output and energy input ) and NER ( Net energy ratio i.e . ratio of energy output to energy input ) a indicator for estimating the viability of the system . Although , many of them have shown these indicator to be positive , yet the value are very le . The result of this study , when compared with two previous study of Jatropha , show that the value for these indicator can be increased to a much greater extent , if we use a high input Jatropha biodiesel system . Further , when compared to a study done on palm oil and Coconut oil , it wa found even if the NEB and NER of biodiesel from Jatropha were lesser in comparison to those of Palm oil and Coconut oil , yet , when energy content of the co-products were also considered , Jatropha had the highest value for both the indicator in comparison to the rest two .

aVThe objective of this paper is to evaluate the greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emission impact of the use of different alternative biofuels in passenger vehicle in Spain in order to meet EU biofuel goal . Different crop production alternative are analysed , including the possible import of some raw material . Availability of land for national production of the raw material is analysed and indirect land use change and associated GHG emission are quantified . There are important difference in GHG emission of biofuels depending on the raw material used and whether this is domestically produced or imported . Ethanol production using imported cereal and FAME production using domestic rapeseed have the highest GHG emission per kilometre driven . Fatty acid methyl ester ( FAME ) production from sunflower ha shown the lowest emission . When taking into account the result of GHG emission saving per hectare , these finding are somehow reversed . Production of ethanol and around 12 % of FAME can be done domestically . The rest will need to be imported and will cause indirect land use change ( ILUC ) . Therefore , ethanol production will not displace any land , whereas FAME production will displace some amount of land . Calculated ILUC factor are 29 % -34 % . The additional GHG emission due to these indirect land use change are significant ( 67 % -344 % of life cycle GHG emission ) . Standalone , the EU biofuel target can have important benefit for Spain in term of global warming emission avoided . However , when considering the impact of land use change effect , these benefit are significantly reduced and can even be negative . ( C ) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVRocky shore faunal community are tractable system which are sensitive to climate change . Here , we resurveyed a historical census of rocky shore fauna conducted in the 19405 and 1950s to ass whether there were latitudinal change in distribution and abundance consistent with global climate change along Australia 's east coast . This region ha undergone rapid warming , with increase in temperature of similar to 1.5 degree C over the past 60 year . We also tested a historical hypothesis that a dramatic transition from tropical specie to temperate specie at 25 degree S represents a biogeographical boundary caused by environmental transition in wave action and dispersal barrier . Twenty-two rocky shore were sampled between 23 degree S and 35 degree S , covering 1500 km of the coastline . A total of 80 specie of macro-fauna were identified . Historical comparison of the 30 most common specie revealed little change in specie distribution with warming ocean temperature . We conclude that the environmental transition driven by wave exposure , local current and the presence of large sand island , and not temperature , is the primary factor influencing biogeographic distribution along the subtropical east coast of Australia .

aVAn understanding of the dynamic of soil organic carbon ( SOC ) a affected by farming practice is imperative for maintaining soil productivity and mitigating global warming . Results of a long-term ( 32 year ) experiment in the Indian Himalayas under rainfed soybean ( Glycine max L. ) - wheat ( Triticum aestivum L. ) rotation wa analyzed to determine the effect of mineral fertilizer and farmyard manure ( FYM ) application at 10 Mg ha ( -1 ) on SOC stock and depth distribution of the labile and recalcitrant pool of SOC . Results indicate all treatment increased SOC content over the control . The annual application of NPK significantly ( P < 0.05 ) enhanced total SOC , oxidizable soil organic C and it fraction over the control plot . The increase in these SOC fraction wa greater with the NPK + FYM treatment . Nearly 16 % ( mean of all treatment ) of the estimated added C wa stabilized into SOC both in the labile and recalcitrant pool , preferentially in the 0-30 cm soil layer . However , the labile : recalcitrant SOC ratio of applied C stabilized wa largest in the 15-30 cm soil layer . About 62 % of total SOC wa present in the labile pool . Plots under the N + FYM and NPK + FYM treatment contained a larger proportion of total SOC in the recalcitrant pool than the plot with mineral or no fertilizer , indicating that FYM application promoted SOC stabilization .

aVTo study how global warming and eutrophication affect water ecosystem , a multiplicative growth Monod model , modified by incorporating the Arrhenius equation , wa applied to Lake Taihu to quantitatively study the relationship between algal biomass and both nutrient and temperature using long-term data . To qualitatively ass which factor wa a limitation of the improved model , temperature variable were calculated using annual mean air temperature ( AT ) , water temperature ( WT ) , and their average temperature ( ST ) , while substrate variable were calculated using annual mean total nitrogen ( TN ) , total phosphorus ( TP ) , and their weighted aggregate ( R ) , respectively . The nine fitted curve showed that TN and AT were two important factor influencing algal growth ; AT limited growth a algal photosynthesis is mainly carried out near the water surface ; N leakage of phytoplankton and internal phosphorus load from sediment explains why TN wa the best predictor of peak biomass using the Monod model . The fitted result suggest that annual mean algal biomass increased by 0.145 time when annual mean AT increased by 1.0 degree C. Results also showed that the more eutrophic the lake , the greater the effect AT had on algal growth . Subsequently , the long-term joint effect of annual temperature increase and eutrophication to water ecosystem can be quantitatively assessed and predicted .

aVInvestigation of cost effective CO ( 2 ) adsorbent ha been a long demanding task in the present scenario of global warming . The present work investigates the high pressure carbon dioxide capture capacity of low cost magnetite decorated functionalized graphite nanoplatelets novel nanocomposite . Graphite nanoplatelets were prepared by acid intercalation followed by thermal exfoliation . Functionalization of graphite nanoplatelets wa done by treatment in acidic medium . Magnetite nanoparticles were decorated onto functionalized graphite nanoplatelets surface by a chemical method . Magnetite decorated functionalized graphite nanoplatelets nanocomposite wa characterized by electron microscopy , X-ray powder diffraction pattern , surface area analysis , Raman spectroscopy and FTIR spectroscopy technique . The carbon dioxide capture capacity wa measured using high pressure Sieverts apparatus . Adsorption capacity wa calculated using the gas equation and incorporating van der Waals correction at three different temperature ( 25 , 50 and 100 degree C ) . A large enhancement in carbon dioxide uptake capacity of 55 % , 80 % , and 90 % at near 11.5 bar pressure for 100 degree C , 50 degree C and 25 degree C , respectively , wa achieved by decorating magnetite nanoparticles onto functionalized graphite nanoplatelet surface .

aVGeochemical environment , fate , and effect are modeled for methane released into seawater by the decomposition of climate-sensitive clathrates . A contemporary global background cycle is first constructed , within the framework of the Parallel Ocean Program . Input from organic in the upper thermocline is related to oxygen level , and microbial consumption is parameterized from available rate measurement . Seepage into bottom layer is then superimposed , representing typical seabed fluid flow . The resulting CH ( 4 ) distribution is validated against surface saturation ratio , vertical section , and slope plume study . Injections of clathrate-derived methane are explored by distributing a small number of point source around the Arctic continental shelf , where stock are extensive and susceptible to instability during the first few decade of global warming . Isolated bottom cell are assigned dissolved gas flux from porous-media simulation . Given the present bulk removal pattern , methane doe not penetrate far from emission site . Accumulated effect , however , spread to the regional scale following the modeled current system . Both hypoxification and acidification are documented . Sensitivity study illustrate a potential for material restriction to broaden the perturbation , since methanotrophic consumer require nutrient and trace metal . When such factor are considered , methane buildup within the Arctic basin is enhanced . However , freshened polar surface water act a a barrier to atmospheric transfer , diverting product into the deep return flow . Uncertainties in the logic and calculation are enumerated including those inherent in high-latitude clathrate abundance , buoyant effluent rise through the column , representation of the general circulation , and bacterial growth kinetics .

aVChanges in surface air temperature during the last century are widely discussed among research in the field of climate change . This paper measure the variability of annual surface air temperature of five major city of Pakistan ( Lahore , Peshawar , Quetta , Hyderabad and Karachi ) for the period from 1882 to 2003 . We perform an exploratory analysis which show that the annual landmass air temperature series of five relatively more important climate station of Pakistan obey the normal distribution . A subsequent trend analysis show that the temperature ha been increasing in the twentieth century for the five ( major ) city of Pakistan , the increase being 0.3A degree C to 1.0A degree C. We computation based on Bayesian analysis for two sample ( e.g. , for Lahore , we use data for the period from 1882 to 1960 and 1961-2000 for first sample and second sample , respectively ) of temperature data of five cite show that the average of annual mean temperature for the second period is higher than the average of first period . Thus , Bayesian inferencing show that the general pattern of evolution of temperature over Pakistan is pretty similar to the current global warming configuration .

aVMethane is a greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 25-fold that of CO ( 2 ) , and animal agriculture is recognized a a source of CH ( 4 ) to the atmosphere . Dairy farm on the southern High Plains of New Mexico and Texas ( USA ) are typically open lot , and source of CH ( 4 ) are enteric emission from cattle and wastewater lagoon . Uncovered anaerobic lagoon are identified by the US Environmental Protection Agency a a source of CH ( 4 ) in dairy manure management system . Our objective wa to quantify summer CH ( 4 ) emission from wastewater lagoon of a commercial dairy farm in eastern New Mexico . Research wa conducted during 8 day in August ( 2009 ) at a 3500 cow open lot dairy farm with flush alley . Methane concentration over three lagoon ( total area of 1.8 ha ) wa measured using open path laser spectroscopy . Background CH ( 4 ) concentration wa measured using a back-flush gas chromatography system with flame ionization . Wind and turbulence data were measured using a three-axis sonic anemometer . Emissions were estimated using an inverse dispersion model . Methane concentration in the air over the lagoon ranged from 3 to 12 ppm , and averaged 5.6 ppm , with a background CH ( 4 ) concentration of 1.83 ppm . Methane flux density ( i.e. , emission rate/unit area ) ranged from 165 to 1184 mu g/m ( 2 ) /s , with a mean daily CH ( 4 ) flux density of 402 kg/ha/d . Methane emission rate averaged 0.211 kg/head/d . Uncovered anaerobic lagoon were a source of CH ( 4 ) emitted from this southern High Plains dairy farm , and lagoon could be a control point for emission reduction .

aVThe majority of Alpine glacier are currently receding because of global warming . Their forefields have become interesting site to study primary microbial colonisation and microbial adaptation . Here , the structure and enzyme activity of microbial community in exposed rock substrate and their change in a gradient of temperature and soil moisture condition within the forefield of the Damma glacier in the Swiss Central Alps are discussed . The temperature at the site differed in the course of a day and also showed differing mean temperature over the summer . Distinct bacterial community inhabit the differing site at the beginning of the experiment and even after transplantation they stay distinct . But a seasonal shift in the community could be observed , which followed the same pattern for all the sample . Interestingly , microbial enzyme activity wa highest at the site with the smallest temperature shift . ( C ) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVHuman exposure to microcystins , which are produced by freshwater cyanobacterial specie , is of growing concern due to increasing appearance of cyanobacterial bloom a a consequence of global warming and increasing water eutrophication . Although microcystins are considered to be liver-specific , there is evidence that they may also affect other tissue . These substance have been shown to induce DNA damage in vitro and in vivo , but the mechanism of their genotoxic activity remain unclear . In human peripheral blood lymphocyte ( HPBLs ) exposure to non-cytotoxic concentration ( 0 , 0.1 , 1 and 10 mu g/ml ) of microcystin-LR ( MCLR ) induced a dose- and time-dependent increase in DNA damage , a measured with the comet assay . Digestion of DNA from MCLR-treated HPBLs with purified formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase ( Fpg ) displayed a greater number of DNA strand-breaks than non-digested DNA , confirming the evidence that MCLR induces oxidative DNA damage . With the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay no statistically significant induction of micronuclei , nucleoplasmic bridge and nuclear bud wa observed after a 24-h exposure to MCLR . At the molecular level , no change in the expression of selected gene involved in the cellular response to DNA damage and oxidative stress were observed after a 4-h exposure to MCLR ( 1 mu g/ml ) . After 24 h , DNA damage-responsive gene ( p53 , mdm2 , gadd45a , cdkn1a ) , a gene involved in apoptosis ( bax ) and oxidative stress-responsive gene ( cat , gpx1 , sod 1 , gsr , gclc ) were up-regulated . These result provide strong support that MCLR is an indirectly genotoxic agent , acting via induction of oxidative stress , and that lymphocyte are also the target of microcystin-induced toxicity .

aVAnthropogenic carbon dioxide emission are thought to be one cause of global warming . Current method for CO ( 2 ) capture result in large energy penalty . Solid adsorbent are a potential method to capture CO ( 2 ) , but the sorbent-sorbate affinity is critical in determining the energetic viability of such process . In this study , the adsorption of CO ( 2 ) in a range of microporous organic polymer wa tested . These material adsorb up to 2.20 mmol/g CO ( 2 ) at 298 K and 1 bar , and thus performance is compared with related porous solid in the literature . The relationship between CO ( 2 ) uptake and apparent surface area and pore size is described , and this showed that heat of adsorption were important in the low pressure regime . The chemical tuning of gas-sorbent affinity provides a blueprint for the development of improved material in this area .

aVWe investigate the extent that Nigerian household engage in internal migration to ensure against ex ante and ex post agricultural risk due to weather-related variability and shock . We use data on the migration pattern of individual over a twenty-year period and temperature degree day to proxy agricultural risk . We find suggestive evidence of household response to ex ante risk by sending male to migrate . Robust finding show that male migrate in response to ex post risk . As global climate change increase risk , these result suggest that increased migration could result a household mitigate risk and strain limited resource in Nigerian city .

aVA coupled climate-ice-sheet model is used to investigate the response of climate at the millennial time scale under several global warming long-term scenario , stabilized at different level ranging from 2 to 7 time the pre-industrial CO ( 2 ) level . The climate response is mainly analyzed in term of change in temperature , oceanic circulation , and ice-sheet behaviour . For the 4 x CO ( 2 ) scenario , the climate response appears to be highly non-linear : abrupt transition occur in the Southern Ocean deep water formation strength with a period of about 1200 yr . These millennial oscillation do not occur for both lower and larger CO ( 2 ) level . We show that these transition are associated with internal oscillation of the Southern Ocean , triggered by the Antarctic freshwater budget . We first analyse the oscillatory mechanism . Secondly , through a series of 420 sensitivity experiment we also explore the range of temperature and freshwater flux for which such oscillation can be triggered . ( C ) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

aVIn this paper , a mathematical model of an oxy-fuel combustion boiler system with flue gas recirculation is investigated . The reduction of CO ( 2 ) emission from coal-fired power plant is an important research issue in alleviating the global warming . The entire dynamic are decomposed in two main part ; fireside dynamic and water-side dynamic . The fire-side dynamic consist of the mass and energy balance equation in the furnace ( combustion process ) and the flue gas dynamic represented by the mass balance equation of five gas ( O ( 2 ) , CO ( 2 ) , SO ( 2 ) , H ( 2 ) O and NO ( 2 ) ) . The water-side dynamic include a drum pressure equation and a steam temperature equation . To validate the developed model , the real experimental data in Karakas . Koumanakos , et al . ( 2007 ) are used . To investigate the local behavior near an operating point , a linearization method at it steady-state condition is pursued . The time response of the entire dynamic using step input ( the oxygen mass flow rate , the coal mass flow rate , the primary air mass flow rate , etc . ) are also discussed . ( C ) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

aVCarbon footprint is widely accepted a an indicator of greenhouse gas emission and global warming . Modeling carbon footprint based on life cycle assessment is applied a a way to evaluate the net contribution of greenhouse gas to the atmosphere from orchard production system over one growing year . This net balance approach considers the source and sink of carbon and therefore provides a better reflection of an orchard system 's net contribution to climate change . Carbon footprinting of organic kiwifruit and apple production system in New Zealand indicated that the studied system had a net sequestration from 2.4 to 5 t of CO ( 2 ) e/ha/year and therefore can be potentially considered a carbon sink under the Kyoto Protocol . This finding implies that the organic kiwifruit and apple orchardist can gain a monetary benefit by earning carbon credit . However , further research to improve and validate this approach is essential before it can be practically used for decision-making at the orchard level and for policymaking at the national level .

aVClimatic change threatens the future of coral reef in the Caribbean and the important ecosystem service they provide . We used a simulation model [ Combo ( `` COral Mortality and Bleaching Output '' ) ] to estimate future coral cover in the part of the eastern Caribbean impacted by a massive coral bleaching event in 2005 . Combo calculates impact of future climate change on coral reef by combining impact from long-term change in average sea surface temperature ( SST ) and ocean acidification with impact from episodic high temperature mortality ( bleaching ) event . We used mortality and heat dose data from the 2005 bleaching event to select historic temperature datasets , to use a a baseline for running Combo under different future climate scenario and set of assumption . Results suggest a bleak future for coral reef in the eastern Caribbean . For three different emission scenario from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ; B1 , A1B , and A1FI ) , coral cover on most Caribbean reef is projected to drop below 5 % by the year 2035 , if future mortality rate are equivalent to some of those observed in the 2005 event ( 50 % ) . For a scenario where coral gain an additional 1-1.5A degree C of heat tolerance through a shift in the algae that live in the coral tissue , coral cover above 5 % is prolonged until 2065 . Additional impact such a storm or anthropogenic damage could result in decline in coral cover even faster than those projected here . These result suggest the need to identify and preserve the location that are likely to have a higher resiliency to bleaching to save a many remnant population of coral a possible in the face of projected wide-spread coral loss .

aVSeasonal variation in temperature is known to drive annual pattern of tick activity and can influence the dynamic of tick-borne disease . An age-structured model of the dynamic of Ixodes ricinus population wa developed to explore how change in average temperature and different level of temperature variability affect seasonal pattern of tick activity and the transmission of tick-borne disease . The model produced seasonal pattern of tick emergence that are consistent with those observed throughout Great Britain . Varying average temperature across a continuous spectrum produced a systematic pattern in the time of peak emergence of questing tick which depends on cumulative temperature over the year . Examination of the effect of between-year stochastic temperature variation on this pattern indicated that peak emergence time are more strongly affected by temperature stochasticity at certain level of average temperature . Finally the model wa extended to give a simple representation of the dynamic of a tick-borne disease . A threshold level of annual cumulative temperature wa identified at which disease persistence is sensitive to stochastic temperature variation . In conclusion , the effect of changing pattern of temperature variation on the dynamic of I. ricinus tick and the disease they transmit may depend on the cumulative temperature over the year and will therefore vary across different location . The result also indicate that diapause mechanism have an important influence on seasonal pattern of tick activity and require further study . ( C ) 2011 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc .

aVTropical alpine grassland , locally known a paramos , are the water tower of the northern Andes . They are an essential water source for drinking water , irrigation scheme and hydropower plant . But despite their high socio-economic relevance , their hydrological process are very poorly understood . Since environmental change , ranging from small scale land-use change to global climate change , is expected to have a strong impact on the hydrological behaviour , a better understanding and hydrological prediction are urgently needed . In this paper , we apply a set of nine hydrological model of different complexity to a small , well monitored upland catchment in the Ecuadorian Andes . The model represent different hypothesis on the hydrological functioning of the paramo ecosystem at catchment scale . Interpretation of the result of the model prediction and uncertainty analysis of the model parameter reveals important insight in the evapotranspiration , surface runoff generation and base flow in the paramo . However , problem with boundary condition , particularly spatial variability of precipitation , pose serious constraint on the differentiation between model representation .

aVIn this study . ICESat altimetry data are used to provide precise lake elevation of the Tibetan Plateau ( IF ) during the period of 2003-2009 . Among the 261 lake examined ICESat data are available on 111 lake : 74 lake with ICESat footprint for 4-7 year and 37 lake with footprint for 1-3 year . This is the first time that precise lake elevation data are provided for the 111 lake . Those ICESat elevation data can be used a baseline for future change in lake level a well a for change during the 2003-2009 period . It is found that in the 74 lake ( 56 salt lake ) examined , 62 ( i.e . 84 % ) of all lake and 50 ( i.e . 89 % ) of the salt lake show tendency of lake level increase . The mean lake water level increase rate is 0.23 m/year for the 56 salt lake and 0.27 m/year for the 50 salt lake of water level increase . The largest lake level increase rate ( 0.80 m/year ) found in this study is the lake Cedo Caka . The 74 lake are grouped into four subareas based on geographical location and change tendency in lake level . Three of the four subareas show increased lake level . The mean lake level change rate for subareas I , II , III , IV , and the entire TP are 0.12 , 0.26 , 0.19 , -0.11 , and 0.2 m/year , respectively . These recent increase in lake level , particularly for a high percentage of salt lake , support accelerated glacier melting due to global warming a the most likely cause . ( C ) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

aVBackground : Vector control is a key strategy for eradication of filariasis , but it is limited , possibly due to rapid propagation from global warming . In Thailand , Mansonia mosquito are major vector of filariasis caused by Brugia malayi filarial nematode . However , little is yet known about vector biology and host-parasite relationship . Objectives : Demonstrate the preliminary data of salivary gland morphology and protein profile of human filarial mosquito M uniformis . Methods : Morphology of M. uniformis salivary gland in both sex wa comparatively studied under a light microscope . Total protein quantization and sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE ) wa performed to compare protein profile between male and female . In addition , quantitative analysis prior to and after blood feeding wa made at different time ( 0 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 , and 72 hour ) Results : Total salivary gland protein of male and female wa 0.32+/-0.03 and 1.38+/-0.02 mu g/pair gland , respectively . SDS-PAGE analysis of the female salivary gland protein prior to blood meal demonstrated twelve band of major protein at 21 , 22 , 24 , 26 , 37 , 39 , 44 , 53 , 55 , 61 , 72 , and 100 kDa . Compared to female , male salivary gland wa composed of seven major protein band at 39 , 44 , 53 , 55 , 61 , 83 , and 100 kDa . Quantitative study after blood feeding revealed that protein of 37 kDa decreased gradually whereas protein of 61 and 83 kDa started to increase dramatically at 24 hour . It wa postulated that the 37 kDa band , found only in the female , might serve a a candidate molecule for facilitating blood feeding . Conclusion : Morphology and protein component of M. uniformis salivary gland might relate to blood feeding process and filarial disease transmission .

aVI examined tree recruitment and mortality over a ten-year period at permanent plot in an urban forest , Forest Park , in Portland , Oregon . The density and diameter at breast height ( dbh ) for all tree living and dead were measured in 1993 and again in 2003 . Data were analyzed using paired Student t-tests . I found significantly fewer live and significantly more dead tree in 2003 than in 1993 . The increase in mortality wa significant for all specie of tree and for all size except large diameter tree . Mortality rate ranged from 0 % to 67 % at my site . Recruitment wa lower at all site in 2003 with significantly fewer seedling and sapling . The high mortality and low recruitment resulted in a net loss of tree at all site . Loss of tree wa not offset by increasing tree diameter , which suggests self-thinning is not the cause . No strong correlation with an urban to rural land use gradient wa observed . The result may be related to global climate change or pollution . The high mortality of tree of all specie in many diameter class without a concomitant increase in recruitment could lead to dramatic change in forest structure .

aVPotential change in precipitation extreme in July-August over China in response to CO ( 2 ) doubling are analyzed based on the output of 24 coupled climate model from the Twentieth-Century Climate in Coupled Models ( 2003M ) experiment and the 1 % per year CO ( 2 ) increase experiment ( to doubling ) ( 1pctto2x ) of phase 3 of the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project ( CMIP3 ) . Evaluation of the model ' performance in simulating the mean state show that the majority of model fairly reproduce the broad spatial pattern of observed precipitation . However , all the model underestimate extreme precipitation by similar to 50 % . The spread among the model over the Tibetan Plateau is similar to 2-3 time larger than that over the other area . Models with higher resolution generally perform better than those with lower resolution in term of spatial pattern and precipitation amount . Under the 1pctto2x scenario , the ratio between the absolute value of MME extreme precipitation change and model spread is larger than that of total precipitation , indicating a relatively robust change of extreme . The change of extreme precipitation is more homogeneous than the total precipitation . Analysis on the output of Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory coupled climate model version 2.1 ( GFDL-CM2.1 ) indicates that the spatially consistent increase of surface temperature and water vapor content contribute to the large increase of extreme precipitation over contiguous China , which follows the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship . Whereas , the meridionally tri-polar pattern of mean precipitation change over eastern China is dominated by the change of water vapor convergence , which is determined by the response of monsoon circulation to global warming .

aVThe North Brazil Current ( NBC ) connects the North and South Atlantic and is the major pathway for the surface return flow of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation ( AMOC ) . Here , we calculate the NBC geostrophic transport time series based on 5 decade of observation near the western boundary off the coast of Brazil . Results reveal a multidecadal NBC variability that lag Labrador Sea deep convection by a few year . The NBC transport time series is coherent with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation in sea surface temperature , which also ha been widely linked to AMOC fluctuation in previous modeling study . Our result thus suggest that the observed multidecadal NBC transport variability is a useful indicator for AMOC variation . The suggested connection between the NBC and AMOC is assessed in a 700 year control simulation of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory 's CM2.1 coupled climate model . The model result are in agreement with observation and further demonstrate that the variability of NBC transport is a good index for tracking AMOC variation . Concerning the debate about whether a slowdown of AMOC ha already occurred under global warming , the observed NBC transport time series suggests strong multidecadal variability but no significant trend .

aVGlobal climate change observed during the last two decade of the 20th century ha attracted the attention of the world 's scientific community . The non-uniqueness of atmospheric aerosol and the impact of cloud on warming ( or cooling ) of the atmosphere-underlying surface system need more detailed modelling to elucidate the optical property of the atmosphere and surface . In multi-angle remote sensing , inverse problem retrieval using radiance over only one pixel present a fundamental difficulty involving the multiplicity of solution . In particular , it wa found that different analytical approach for the retrieval of optical parameter give a multiplicity of solution , even in the simplest case of the slab homogeneous model and the standard scheme of illumination of the clear atmosphere . The phase function wa approximated with one parameter function . Only four parameter of the homogeneous atmosphere are retrieved in our simple variant . The found effect doe not link with the low information content of observational data in respect to the desired parameter . It is not a result of the ill-posed inverse problem , insofar a it concern property of integral functionals in customary comprehension and call for strong variation of vertical profile of parameter . It seems that the effect of solution multiplicity is a direct consequence of radiation field non-linear dependence on atmospheric and surface parameter that lead to closely coinciding radiation field forming with essentially different combination of optical parameter .

aVRemote sensing of global aerosol ha constituted a great scientific interest in a variety of application related to global warming and climate change . The present study us Level 2 ( 10 x 10 km ) and Level 3 ( 1 degree x 1 degree ) Terra/Aqua MODIS ( C005 ) derived aerosol optical depth at 550 nm ( AOD ( 550 ) ) and compare them with ground-based ( MICROTOPS-II , MT ) sun photometer measured AOD ( 550 ) in the period 2002-2008 over Hyderabad , India . The correlation coefficient ( R ( 2 ) ) between Level 3 Terra/Aqua MODIS and MT AOD ( 550 ) in all season range from 0.30 to 0.46 . Even lower correlation revealed when the Level 2 MODIS data are used ( R ( 2 ) = 0.16-0.30 ) . The Level 3 MODIS AOD ( 550 ) underestimate significantly the MT AOD ( 550 ) , while the Level 2 AOD ( 550 ) value are much larger than those of Level 3 . The comparison of the Terra/Aqua MODIS AOD ( 550 ) at regional scale , and especially over urban/industrial area with significant aerosol diurnal variation , constitutes a real challenge and may reveal the ability of the two sensor to capture the temporal variation of the aerosol loading within a time interval of 3 h. The result show relatively good correlation ( R ( 2 ) similar to 0.6-0.7 ) regarding the Level 3 dataset ; however , the Level 2 data showed large scatter and very poor correlation . On the other hand , the mean seasonal AOD ( 550 ) value are similar , while Terra AOD ( 550 ) is higher than that obtained from Aqua . Both satellite and ground-based measurement show remarkable increasing trend in AOD over Hyderabad , which are attributed to the extension of the urbanized area , the growing of population , motor vehicle and local emission .

aVNitrous oxide ( N ( 2 ) O ) is generated by natural and anthropogenic process and ha a critical role in environmental chemistry . It ha an ozone-depleting potential similar to that of hydrochlorofluorocarbon a well a a global warming potential exceeding that of CO ( 2 ) 300-fold ( 1,2 ) . In bacterial denitrification , N ( 2 ) O is reduced to N ( 2 ) by the copper-dependent nitrous oxide reductase ( N ( 2 ) OR ) ( 3 ) . This enzyme carry the mixed-valent Cu ( A ) centre and the unique , tetranuclear Cu ( Z ) site . Previous structural data were obtained with enzyme isolated in the presence of air that is catalytically inactive without prior reduction . Its Cu ( Z ) site wa described a a [ 4Cu : S ] centre , and the substrate-binding mode and reduction mechanism remained elusive . Here we report the structure of purple N ( 2 ) OR from Pseudomonas stutzeri , handled under the exclusion of dioxygen , and locate the substrate in N ( 2 ) O-pressurized crystal . The active Cu ( Z ) cluster contains two sulphur atom , yielding a [ 4Cu:2S ] stoichiometry ; and N ( 2 ) O bound side-on at Cu ( Z ) , in close proximity to Cu ( A ) . With the substrate located between the two cluster , electron are transferred directly from Cu ( A ) to N ( 2 ) O , which is activated by side-on binding in a specific binding pocket on the face of the [ 4Cu:2S ] centre . These result reconcile a multitude of available biochemical data on N ( 2 ) OR that could not be explained by earlier structure , and outline a mechanistic pathway in which both metal centre and the intervening protein act in concert to achieve catalysis . This structure represents the first direct observation , to our knowledge , of N ( 2 ) O bound to it reductase , and shed light on the functionality of metalloenzymes that activate inert small-molecule substrate . The principle of using distinct cluster for substrate activation and for reduction may be relevant for similar system , in particular nitrogen-fixing nitrogenase ( 4 ) .

aVGiven current international effort to reduce greenhouse gas emission and limit human-induced global-mean near-surface temperature increase to 2A degree C , relative to the pre-industrial era , we seek to determine the impact such a temperature increase might have upon the frequency of seasonal-mean temperature extreme ; further we seek to determine what global-mean temperature increase would prevent extreme temperature value from becoming the norm . Results indicate that given a 2A degree C global mean temperature increase it is expected that for 70-80 % of the land surface maximum seasonal-mean temperature will exceed historical extreme ( a determined from the 95th percentile threshold value over the second half of the 20th Century ) in at least half of all year , i.e . the current historical extreme value will effectively become the norm . Many region of the globe-including much of Africa , the southeastern and central portion of Asia , Indonesia , and the Amazon-will reach this point given the `` committed '' future global-mean temperature increase of 0.6A degree C ( 1.4A degree C relative to the pre-industrial era ) and 50 % of the land surface will reach it given a future global-mean temperature increase of between 0.8 and 0.95A degree C ( 1.6-1.75A degree C relative to the pre-industrial era ) . These result suggest substantial fraction of the globe could experience seasonal-mean temperature extreme with high regularity , even if the global-mean temperature increase remains below the 2A degree C target .

aVCapsule The population of Rock Ptarmigan in Japan have the southernmost distribution of Rock Ptarmigan in the world ; they nest in moderately open site which facilitate the detection of predator . Aims To ass nest site selection of this population of Rock Ptarmigan and to compare the data with those for other population of this specie . Methods Nest site characteristic were recorded and compared with random site . Nest success , clutch size , and hatching rate were determined . Results All nest ( n = 24 ) were found in Pinus pumila shrub . Vegetation height at nest wa significantly lower than at random site . While the nest were well concealed , one direction of lateral cover wa moderately open and it cover wa significantly le than at random site . Such nest placement may provide a good view from the nest , facilitating the detection of predator . Nesting success wa 75.3 % in 2006 and 61.1 % in 2007 , which is higher than reported in other population of this specie . Conclusion Rock Ptarmigan selected P. pumila shrub with moderately open site for their nest . We propose that these nest characteristic are related to nesting predation . Selection of nesting site may depend on several factor . We suggest how this information can be used to guide conservation measure for this and perhaps other population of Rock Ptarmigan . The population in Japan are at risk of extinction due to global warming and/or habitat loss .

aVBackground : Several recent climate change review have stressed the possibility of some malaria vector occupying region of higher altitude than previously recorded . Indeed , highland malaria ha been observed in several African nation , possibly attributable to change in land use , vector control and local climate . This study attempt to expand the current knowledge of the distribution of common Anopheles specie in Ecuador , with particular attention to highland region ( > 500 m ) of the Andes . Methods : Extensive field collection of larva were undertaken in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 throughout all region of Ecuador ( except the lower-altitude Amazonian plain ) and compared to historical distribution map reproduced from the 1940s . Larvae were identified using both a morphological key and sequencing of the 800 bp region of the CO1 mitochondrial gene . In addition , spatial statistic ( Getis-Ord Hotspot Analysis : Gi* ) were used to determine high and low-density cluster of each specie in Ecuador . Results : Distributions have been updated for five specie of Anopheles in Ecuador : Anopheles albimanus , Anopheles pseudopunctipennis , Anopheles punctimacula , Anopheles eiseni and Anopheles oswaldoi s.l.. Historical map indicate that An . pseudopunctipennis used to be widespread in highland Andean valley , while other specie were completely restricted to lowland area . By comparison , updated map for the other four collected specie show higher maximum elevation and/or more widespread distribution in highland region than previously recorded . Gi* analysis determined some highland hot spot for An . albimanus , but only cold spot for all other specie . Conclusions : This study document the establishment of multiple anopheline specie in high altitude region of Ecuador , often in area where malaria eradication program are not focused .

aVBackground : Copepods outnumber every other multicellular animal group . They are critical component of the world 's freshwater and marine ecosystem , sensitive indicator of local and global climate change , key ecosystem service provider , parasite and predator of economically important aquatic animal and potential vector of waterborne disease . Copepods sustain the world fishery that nourish and support human population . Although genomic tool have transformed many area of biological and biomedical research , their power to elucidate aspect of the biology , behavior and ecology of copepod ha only recently begun to be exploited . Discussion : The extraordinary biological and ecological diversity of the subclass Copepoda provides both unique advantage for addressing key problem in aquatic system and formidable challenge for developing a focused genomics strategy . This article provides an overview of genomic study of copepod and discus strategy for using genomics tool to address key question at level extending from individual to ecosystem . Genomics can , for instance , help to decipher pattern of genome evolution such a those that occur during transition from free living to symbiotic and parasitic lifestyle and can assist in the identification of genetic mechanism and accompanying physiological change associated with adaptation to new or physiologically challenging environment . The adaptive significance of the diversity in genome size and unique mechanism of genome reorganization during development could similarly be explored . Genome-wide and EST study of parasitic copepod of salmon and large EST study of selected free-living copepod have demonstrated the potential utility of modern genomics approach for the study of copepod and have generated resource such a EST library , shotgun genome sequence , BAC library , genome map and inbred line that will be invaluable in assisting further effort to provide genomics tool for copepod . Summary : Genomics research on copepod is needed to extend our exploration and characterization of their fundamental biological trait , so that we can better understand how copepod function and interact in diverse environment . Availability of large scale genomics resource will also open door to a wide range of system biology type study that view the organism a the fundamental system in which to address key question in ecology and evolution .

aVGiven the high cost of crude oil , uncertainty regarding future reserve a well a the phenomenon of global warming , alternative fuel such a bioethanol need to be developed and deployed . This work present an economic analysis ( operating cost analysis ) of one annexed African distillery operating in a landlocked and rural location . Specifically , the study attempt to analyze the impact that some of the critical factor influencing bioethanol production will have on it viability and also present an analysis of the breakdown of the operating cost of the distillery , in an equation format to enable easier and more rapid use of the data in numerical and economic model , and in the preliminary design and optimization of bioethanol plant . The cost of ethanol production wa estimated at $ 19.57/HL with cost of feedstock ( molasses `` type C '' ) constituting about one third of the production cost . The study also identified other major , intermediate , and minor input factor , which can provide insight to both the possible barrier to implementation that should be overcome , and on the technological improvement option that should be stimulated by research and development in ethanol industry . Finally , from the operating cost analysis of the annexed distillery , it emerged that the factorial approach to estimation is principally a sound one , with no indication of untypical cost item . Some of the typical cost item do however display ratio to the base cost that are outside of previously reported limit .

aVIn the current aviation context , one of the major concern of commercial aviation stakeholder is to improve the environmental footprint of aviation . This research , integrated into the European Clean Sky project , address the optimization of commercial aircraft departure procedure in order to minimize their environmental footprint . The environmental impact is defined by noise nuisance in the protected zone near airport , local air quality , and global warming . A recent , innovating method is proposed to solve the problem of a real-world aircraft departing from an ideal airport . A multiobjective , constrained , nonlinear optimization problem is formulated to obtain optimal departure procedure . The promising result obtained by the application of this methodology to a theoretical but representative scenario strongly encourage research activity in this direction .

aVOn the basis of landscape-climatic reconstruction for warming period in the past , likely scenario of future global warming have been developed for various warming level that might be reached during the current century . The paleoanalogue of global warming by 0.7-1 degree C is the Holocene climatic optimum ( 5.5-6 ka B.P . ) and that by 1.7-2 degree C is the last interglacial optimum ( about 125 ka B.P. ) . The complex analysis concerning response of the principal ecosystem component to the expected warming signifies that there will not be any shift of vegetation zone during the 21st century ; reconstruction will touch only the internal structure of vegetable association and broadening of interzonal ecotones .

aVThe penetration of Steller 's sea lion into the water of the Chukchi and East-Siberian sea to the west from Bering Strait , beyond the limit of the northern part of their main area are discussed . The information collected by the author during their own investigation and inquiry of local people and officer of different service , showed that at the end of the 1970s-1980s , Steller 's sea lion started to penetrate regularly into the water of the Chukchi and East-Siberian sea . They appeared to the west of the Kolyma river mouth and in the mouth of other river , especially frequently in the 2000s . Such far penetration of the Steller 's sea lion in the western direction may be connected with the phenomenon of global warming that resulted in the decrease of the ice cover in the Chukchi and East-Siberian Seas and rise of water temperature . The northern sea investigated appeared to become more attractive for these seal normally inhabiting warmer sea . Probably , the first stage of the colonization of new territory by the Steller 's sea lion wa revealed .

aVLeaf photosynthetic activity limited by summer heat stress represents large constraint to production process of fruit tree . To cope with this problem , we tested photosystem II ( PS II ) thermostability in clonal apple tree rootstock with different growth intensity - semi-vigorous-MM106 and dwarfing-J-TE-F experiencing summer heat stress , and related antioxidative activity and phytohormonal balance . For this purpose , expanded leaf were collected and utilized for determination of 3-indoleacetic acid ( IAA ) , cytokinin ( CKs ) , abscisic acid ( ABA ) concentration , and superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) , total peroxidase ( POX ) , catalase ( CAT ) , total antioxidative activity ( TAA ) and PS II thermostability before and after 30 min dark exposition to temperature of 42 degree C ( because of relatively-stable PS II ) . Leaves from dwarfing-J-TE-F showed higher PS II thermostability than that from semi-vigorous-MM106 a indicated by higher maximal quantum yield of primary photochemistry ( Phi ( Po ) ) , excitation transfer efficiency to electron transport chain ( psi ( o ) ) , electron transport yield ( Phi ( Eo ) ) and lower thermal dissipation yield ( Phi ( Do ) ) . From antioxidant parameter , genotypic specifity can be seen in total peroxidase activity and only JTE-F leaf predominated . Despite higher CKs concentration in leaf of MM106 , active CKs did not show any difference between two rootstock . IAA also exhibited balanced level , but ABA concentration wa four time higher in J-TE-F leaf than MM106 one . We can conclude that in PS II heat-hardening of apple tree rootstock leaf , which is at least partly provided by enhanced peroxidase activity , ABA play the central role and J-TE-F rootstock can be recomended to heat stress in the prone region .

aVThe vegetation in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau is thought to be highly sensitive and more vulnerable to global climate change than that of other area . The uplift of the plateau a well a the climatic oscillation during glacial period had a profound impact on plant specie distribution and genetic diversity there . In the present study , seven pair of cpSSR ( chloroplast Simple Sequence Repeat ) primer were utilized to detect genetic variety of Populus cathayana Rehd population from their natural range in the southeastern area of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau . A total of 28 allele and 12 different haplotype were detected . The proportion of haplotype variation among population ( G ( ST ) = 0.794 , N-ST = 0.900 ) indicated high level of genetic differentiation among population and a significant phylogeographic structure ( N-ST > G ( ST ) , P < 0.05 ) . This appears to support the hypothesis that these population were derived from multiple refugia area during the Quaternary climatic oscillation . Based on the haplotype network and mismatch distribution analysis , we found no evidence of postglacial range recolonization and expansion by P cathayana in this region . This might be mainly due to the complex topography of the southeastern part of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau . The lofty mountain range and deep valley in this region might have prevented long-distance migration of this specie during the climatic amelioration .

aVCarbon dioxide capture from point source like coal-fired power plant is considered to be a solution for stabilizing the CO ( 2 ) level in the atmosphere to avoid global warming . Methane is an important energy source that is often highly diluted by nitrogen in natural gas . For the separation of CO ( 2 ) and CH ( 4 ) from N ( 2 ) in flue gas and natural gas , respectively , sorbent with high and reversible gas uptake , high gas selectivity , good chemical and thermal stability , and low cost are desired . Here we report the synthesis and CO ( 2 ) , CH ( 4 ) , and N ( 2 ) adsorption property of hierarchically porous electron-rich covalent organonitridic framework ( PECONFs ) . These were prepared by simple condensation reaction between inexpensive , commercially available nitridic and electron-rich aromatic building unit . The PECONF material exhibit high and reversible CO ( 2 ) and CH ( 4 ) uptake and exceptional selectivity of these gas over N ( 2 ) . The material do not oxidize in air up to temperature of 400 degree C .

aVBackground : Vector-borne infectious disease are a significant cause of human and animal mortality and morbidity . Modeling study predict that change in climate that accompany global warming will alter the transmission risk of many vector-borne infectious disease in different part of the world . Global warming will also raise sea level , which will lead to an increase in saline and brackish water body in coastal area . The potential impact of rising sea level , a opposed to climate change , on the prevalence of vector-borne infectious disease ha hitherto been unrecognised . Presentation of the hypothesis : Mosquito specie possessing salinity-tolerant larva and pupa , and capable of transmitting arbovirus and parasite are found in many part of the world . An expansion of brackish and saline water body in coastal area , associated with rising sea level , can increase density of salinity-tolerant vector mosquito and lead to the adaptation of freshwater vector to breed in brackish and saline water . The breeding of non-mosquito vector may also be influenced by salinity change in coastal habitat . Higher vector density can increase transmission of vector-borne infectious disease in coastal locality , which can then spread to other area . Testing the hypothesis : The demonstration of increase in vector population and disease prevalence that is related to an expansion of brackish/saline water body in coastal area will provide the necessary supportive evidence . However the implementation of specific vector and disease control measure to counter the threat will confound the expected finding . Implications of the hypothesis : Rising sea level can act synergistically with climate change and then interact in a complex manner with other environmental and socio-economic factor to generate a greater potential for the transmission of vector-borne infectious disease . The resulting health impact are likely to be particularly significant in resource-poor country in the tropic and semi-tropics . Some measure to meet this threat are outlined .

aVGlobal concentration of CO ( 2 ) in the atmosphere is increasing rapidly . CO ( 2 ) emission have an impact on global climate change . Effective CO ( 2 ) emission abatement strategy such a Carbon Capture and Storage ( CCS ) are required to combat this trend . There are three major approach for CCS : post-combustion capture , pre-combustion capture and oxyfuel process . Post-combustion capture offer some advantage a existing combustion technology can still be used without radical change on them . This make post-combustion capture easier to implement a a retrofit option ( to existing power plant ) compared to the other two approach . Therefore , post-combustion capture is probably the first technology that will be deployed . This paper aim to provide a state-of-the-art assessment of the research work carried out so far in post-combustion capture with chemical absorption . The technology will be introduced first , followed by required preparation of flue gas from power plant to use this technology . The important research programme worldwide and the experimental study based on pilot plant will be reviewed . This is followed by an overview of various study based on modelling and simulation . Then the focus is turned to review development of different solvent and process intensification . Based on these , we try to predict challenge and potential new development from different aspect such a new solvent , pilot plant , process heat integration ( to improve efficiency ) , modelling and simulation , process intensification and government policy impact .

aVWildland fire is a natural force that ha shaped most vegetation type of the world . However , it inappropriate management during the last century ha led to more frequent and catastrophic fire . Wildland fire are also recognized a one of the source of CO ( 2 ) and other greenhouse gas ( GHG ) that influence global climate change . As one of the technique used to reduce the risk of destructive wildfire , prescribed burning ha the potential of mitigating carbon emission , and effectively contributes to the effort proposed a part of the Clean Development Mechanism within the Kyoto protocol . In order to apply this concept to a real case , a simulation study wa conducted in pine afforestation in the Andean region of Patagonia , Argentina , with the objective of evaluating the potential of prescribed burning for reducing GHG emission . The scenario wa established for a ten year period , in which simulated prescribed burning wa compared to the traditional management scheme , which included the probability of annual average of wildfire occurrence based on available wildfire statistic . The two contrasting scenario were : ( 1 ) managed afforestation , affected by the annual average rate of wildfire occurred in the same type of afforestation in the region , without prescribed burning , and ( 2 ) same a ( 1 ) but with the application of simulated prescribed burning . In order to estimate carbon stock , and CO2 removal and emission , we followed the guideline given for GHG inventory on the Agriculture , Forestry and Other Land Uses ( AFOLU ) sector of the International Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , while the terminology used wa the established by IPCC ( 2003 ) . Data of afforested area , thinning , and biomass growth were taken from previous survey in the study area . Downed dead wood and litter ( forest fuel load , FFL ) wa estimated adjusting equation fitted to those fuel , based on field data . Results show that comparing the two scenario , prescribed burning reduced CO2 emission by 44 % compared to the situation without prescribed burning . The prescribed burning scenario represented about 12 % of the total emission ( prescribed burning plus wildfire ) . Furthermore , avoided wildfire by simulated prescribed burning allowed an additional 78 % GHG emission mitigation due to extra biomass growth . Simulated prescribed burning in commercial afforestation of Patagonia appears to be an effective management practice not only to prevent wildfire , but also an efficient tool to mitigate GHG emission . However , more study in different scenario would be needed to generalize these benefit to other ecosystem . ( C ) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All right reserved .

aVSpatial pattern of future atmospheric warming presented by climate model projection indicate that the temperature of the lower troposphere will increase markedly at high latitude in the Northern Hemisphere and also the upper troposphere at low-middle latitude . In this study , potential impact of the spatial pattern of future atmospheric warming on Asian dust emission were investigated by performing numerical experiment using a dynamical downscaling method . After three significant Asian dust outbreak event were reproduced a control run , initial and boundary condition of the control run were updated by adding difference in atmospheric variable between the future climate ( 2091-2100 ) and the recent climate ( 1991-2000 ) to execute pseudo global warming run . The result showed that the dust emission flux in the main Asian dust source ( MADSs ) , i.e. , the Taklimakan and Gobi desert , decrease markedly in the future climate condition . The future decrease in the dust emission flux are likely to be caused by a combination of the relatively large increase in sea level pressure ( SLPs ) in MADSs and the small SLP change to the north of MADSs , which reduces the meridional SLP gradient between the two area and consequently weakens cold air outbreak . The large SLP increase in MADSs may be due to a northward shift of storm track and increased atmospheric stability caused by the large upper-tropospheric warming at low-middle latitude . The small SLP change to the north of MADSs corresponded to the large increase in surface air temperature , which would be influenced by the large lower-tropospheric warming at high latitude .

aVTo discover the mechanism of the continuous summer temperature decline in certain region against significant global warming , 456 national meteorological observational station with long term of observed daily temperature and precipitation data were applied to analyze the relationship between precipitation and temperature . Results show that there is a significant negative correlation between precipitation and temperature , indicating that precipitation influence temperature significantly : the more the precipitation , the lower the temperature , and vice versa . The precipitation effect on temperature can reasonably interpret the typical summer temperature in Southwest China and can partly explain why global warming is more significant in winter than in summer and more significant in higher latitude area than in lower latitude .

aVAs part of a streetlight-retrofitting project in Pittsburgh , this study performed a cradle-to-grave life-cycle assessment of four lighting technology : the widespread high-pressure sodium and metal halide light , and the newer and more efficient induction and light-emitting-diode technology . The study used a hybrid life-cycle-assessment approach to build life-cycle model for the various technology , including manufacturing and installation data for process model and energy supply and input-output data to complete life-cycle model . Three different electricity scenario were used to examine the sensitivity of the impact to change in energy supply : the United States average mix , the regional mix for the ReliabilityFirst Corporation region , and a scenario with 100 % wind power . The result show that for all technology , the impact of electricity in the use phase dominates the result . Because of their lower wattage , light-emitting diode ( LED ) and induction technology perform favorably and similarly . With anticipated improvement in technology , however , LEDs are expected to be more efficient than induction in the near future and have lower environmental impact by the time that Pittsburgh and other city buy and install light a part of these streetlight project , which have the potential to show large cost and emission saving .

aVGlobal warming could increase the number and severity of extreme weather event . These event are often known to result in public health disaster , but we can lessen the effect of these disaster . By addressing the factor that cause change in climate , we can mitigate the effect of climate change . By addressing the factor that make society vulnerable to the effect of climate , we can adapt to climate change . To adapt to climate change , a comprehensive approach to disaster risk reduction ha been proposed . By reducing human vulnerability to disaster , we can lessen-and at time even prevent-their impact . Human vulnerability is a complex phenomenon that comprises social , economic , health , and cultural factor . Because public health is uniquely placed at the community level , it ha the opportunity to lessen human vulnerability to climate-related disaster . At the national and international level , a supportive policy environment can enable local adaptation to disaster event . The purpose of this article is to introduce the basic concept of disaster risk reduction so that it can be applied to preventing and mitigating the negative effect of climate change and to examine the role of community-focused public health a a mean for lessening human vulnerability and , a a result , the overall risk of climate-related disaster .

aVSouth Asian summer monsoon ( June through September ) rainfall simulation and it potential future change are evaluated in a multi-model ensemble of global coupled climate model output under World Climate Research Program Coupled Model Intercomparison Project ( WCRP CMIP3 ) dataset . The response of South Asian summer monsoon to a transient increase in future anthropogenic radiative forcing is investigated for two time slice , middle ( 2031-2050 ) and end of the twenty-first century ( 2081-2100 ) , in the non-mitigated Special Report on Emission Scenarios B1 , A1B and A2 .There is large inter-model variability in the simulation of spatial characteristic of seasonal monsoon precipitation . Ten out of the 25 model are able to simulate space-time characteristic of the South Asian monsoon precipitation reasonably well . The response of these selected ten model ha been examined for projected change in seasonal monsoon rainfall . The multi-model ensemble of these ten model project a significant increase in monsoon precipitation with global warming . The substantial increase in precipitation is observed over western equatorial Indian Ocean and southern part of India . However , the monsoon circulation weakens significantly under all the three climate change experiment . Possible mechanism for the projected increase in precipitation and for precipitation-wind paradox have been discussed . The surface temperature over Asian landmass increase in pre-monsoon month due to global warming and heat low over northwest India intensifies . The dipole snow configuration over Eurasian continent strengthens in warmer atmosphere , which is conducive for the enhancement in precipitation over Indian landmass . No notable change have been projected in the El Nio-Monsoon relationship , which is useful for predicting interannual variation of the monsoon .

aVLogging and poor shifting cultivation negatively affect initial soil carbon ( C ) storage , especially at the initial stage of deforestation , a these practice lead to global warming . As a result , an afforestation program is needed to mitigate this problem . This study assessed initial soil C buildup of rehabilitated forest using Fourier transform infrared ( FTIR ) spectroscopy . The relatively high E4/E6 value of humic acid ( HAs ) in the rehabilitated forest indicate prominence of aliphatic component , suggesting that the HAs were of low molecular weight . The total acidity , carboxylic ( -COOH ) and phenolic ( -OH ) of the rehabilitated forest were found to be consistent with the range reported by other researcher . The spectrum of all location were similar because there wa no significant difference in the quantity of C in humic acid ( CHA ) regardless of forest age and soil depth . The spectrum showed distinct absorbance at 3290 , 1720 , 1630 , 1510 , 1460 , 1380 , and 1270 cm-1 . Increase of band at 1630 and 1510 cm-1 from 0-20 to 40-60 cm were observed , suggesting C buildup from the lowest depth 20-40 and 40-60 cm . However , the CHA content in the soil depth wa not different . The band at 1630 cm-1 wa assigned to carboxylic and aromatic group . Increase in peak intensity at 1510 cm-1 wa because C/N ratio increased with increasing soil depth . This indicates that decomposition rate decreased with increasing soil depth and decreased with CHA . The finding suggests that FTIR spectroscopy enables the assessment of C composition functional group buildup at different depth and age .

We define two energy-related eco-efficiencies : energy efficiency ( ENE ) and greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emission-related eco-efficiency ( GEE ) using energy consumption and the associated GHG emission a the environmental impact . Using statistical data , we analyze China 's energy consumption and GHG emission by industrial subsystem and sector , and estimate the ENE and GEE value for China in 2007 a 4.871x10 ( 7 ) US $ /PJ and 4.26x10 ( 8 ) US $ /TgCO ( 2 ) eq , respectively . Industry is the primary contributing subsystem of China 's economy , contributing 45.2 % to the total economic production , using 79.6 % of the energy consumed , and generating 91.4 % of the total GHG emission . We distinguish the individual contribution of the 39 industrial sector to the national economy , overall energy consumption , and GHG emission , and estimate their energyrelated eco-efficiencies . The result show that although ferrous metal production contributes only 3.5 % to the national industrial economy , it consumes the most industrial energy ( 20 % of total ) , contributes 16 % to the total industrial global warming potential ( GWP ) , and rank third in GHG emission . The power and heat sector rank first in GHG emission and contributes one-third of the total industrial GWP , although it only consumes about 8 % of total industrial energy and , like ferrous metal production , contributes 3.5 % to the national economy . The ENE of the ferrous metal and power and heat sector are only 8 and 2.1x10 ( 7 ) US $ /PJ , while the GEE for these two sector are 9 and 4x10 ( 4 ) US $ /GgCO ( 2 ) eq , respectively ; these are nearly the lowest ENE and GEE value among all 39 industry sector . Finally , we discus the possibility of ecoefficiency improvement through a comparison with other country .

aVThe quantitative value of the urban warming effect over city station in the Korean peninsula were estimated by using the warming mode of Empirical Orthogonal Function ( EOF ) analysis of 55 year of temperature data , from 1954 to 2008 . The estimated amount of urban warming wa verified by applying the multiple linear regression equation with two independent variable : the rate of population growth and the total population . Through the multiple linear regression equation , we obtained a significance level of 0.05 % and a coefficient of determination of 0.60 . This mean that it is somewhat liable to the estimated effect of urbanization , in spite of the setting of some supposition . The city that show great warming due to urbanization are Daegu , Pohang , Seoul , and Incheon , which show value of about 1.35 , 1.17 , 1.16 , and 1.10 degree C , respectively . The area that showed urban warming le than 0.2 degree C are Chupungnyeong and Mokpo . On average , the total temperature increase over South Korea wa about 1.37 degree C : the amount of increase caused by the greenhouse effect is approximately 0.60 degree C , and the amount caused by urban warming is approximately 0.77 degree C.

aVPermian continental sequence from North China contain previously unrecognized episode of plant radiation and elevated extinction . The earliest extinction , in the Lower Shihhotse Formation ( Roadian , Guadalupian ) , record a 45 % floral specie loss and is tentatively correlated with global extinction amongst dinocephalian reptile . Two younger extinction are dated by correlating the Illawara Reversal and palaeomagnetic polarity sequence from Shanxi Province against global palaeomagnetic history . Missing data from the Shanxi sequence are evaluated using a novel approach estimating likely maximum and minimum sequence change that provide age estimate for post-Illawara event in North China . The second extinction in the middle Upper Shihhotse Formation is more significant and is dated to the mid-Capitanian , with a loss of 56 % of plant specie coinciding with two phase of volcanism of the Emeishan Large Igneous Province in South China , previously linked to the mid-Capitanian marine mass extinction . The youngest extinction in the upper Upper Shihhotse Formation ( late Capitanian to mid-Wuchapingian ) is catastrophic and represents the end of range in the sequence . Changes in sedimentary facies suggest it to be related to global climatic warming and drying . Other viable causal mechanism for the extinction episode include plate motion and collision , global climate change , volcanism and biological competition .

aVThe year 2000 radiative forcing ( RF ) due to change in O ( 3 ) and CH ( 4 ) ( and the CH ( 4 ) -induced stratospheric water vapour ) a a result of emission of short-lived gas ( oxide of nitrogen ( NO ( x ) ) , carbon monoxide and non-methane hydrocarbon ) from three transport sector ( ROAD , maritime SHIPping and AIRcraft ) are calculated using result from five global atmospheric chemistry model . Using result from these model plus other published data , we quantify the uncertainty . The RF due to short-term O ( 3 ) change ( i.e . a an immediate response to the emission without allowing for the long-term CH ( 4 ) change ) is positive and highest for ROAD transport ( 31 mW m ( -2 ) ) compared to SHIP ( 24 mW m ( -2 ) ) and AIR ( 17 mW m ( -2 ) ) sector in four of the model . All five model calculate negative RF from the CH ( 4 ) perturbation , with a larger impact from the SHIP sector than for ROAD and AIR . The net RF of O ( 3 ) and CH ( 4 ) combined ( i.e . including the impact of CH ( 4 ) on ozone and stratospheric water vapour ) is positive for ROAD ( +16 ( +/- 13 ) ( one standard deviation ) mW m ( -2 ) ) and AIR ( +6 ( +/- 5 ) inW m ( -2 ) ) traffic sector and is negative for SHIP ( -18 ( +/- 10 ) inW m ( -2 ) ) sector in all five model . Global Warming Potentials ( GWP ) and Global Temperature change Potentials ( GTP ) are presented for AIR NO ( x ) emission : there is a wide spread in the result from the 5 chemistry model , and it is shown that difference in the methane response relative to the O ( 3 ) response drive much of the spread .

aVCarbon dioxide ( CO ( 2 ) ) is a major greenhouse gas and make a significant contribution to global warming and climate change . Thus CO ( 2 ) capture and storage ( CCS ) have attracted worldwide interest from both fundamental and practical research community . Alkali-metal-based oxide such a alkali-metal oxide , binary oxide , and hydrotalcite-like compound are promising adsorbent for CO ( 2 ) capture because of their relatively high adsorption capacity , low cost , and wide availability . They can also be applied to the adsorption-enhanced reaction involving CO ( 2 ) . The microstructures ( e.g. , surface area , porosity , particle size , and dispersion ) of these oxide determine the CO ( 2 ) adsorption capacity and multicycle stability . This perspective critically ass and give an overview of recent development in the synthesized method , adsorption mechanism , operational condition , stability , and regenerability of a variety of oxide . Both pro and con of these oxide are also discussed . Insights are provided into several effective procedure regarding microstructural control of alkali-metal-based oxide , including preparation optimization , modification , stream hydration , etc .

aVThis study deal with the reduction of tin oxide by hydrogen in the temperature range of 773 similar to 1023 K and the hydrogen partial pressure of 30.4 similar to 101.3 kPa . It aim to investigate the kinetics of the reaction between tin oxide and hydrogen . The hydrogen reduction of tin oxide is to be related with the effort to extract tin metal with decreasing the emission of carbon dioxide which cause global warming . The experiment were carried out under isothermal condition in hydrogen atmosphere using TGA equipment . The reduction rate of tin oxide to tin metal by hydrogen wa found to be relatively fast under the whole condition until the reduction ratio of SnO ( 2 ) approach to about 0.95 . As an example , at 1023 K under a hydrogen partial pressure of 101.3 kPa , almost 100 % of tin oxide wa reduced to tin metal in 10 min . The nucleation and growth model yielded a satisfactory fit to these experimental data . The reaction wa first order with respect to hydrogen partial pressure and had an activation energy of 62.5 kJ/mol ( 15.0 kcal/mol ) . [ doi:10.2320/matertrans.M2011118 ]

aVThe decomposition of municipal solid waste ( MSW ) in landfill under anaerobic condition produce landfill gas ( LFG ) containing approximately 50-60 % methane ( CH ( 4 ) ) and 30-40 % carbon dioxide ( CO ( 2 ) ) by volume . CH ( 4 ) ha a global warming potential 21 time greater than CO2 ; thus , it pose a serious environmental problem . As landfill are the main method for waste disposal in Malaysia , the major aim of this study wa to estimate the total CH ( 4 ) emission from landfill in all Malaysian region and state for the year 2009 using the IPCC , 1996 first-order decay ( FOD ) model focusing on clean development mechanism ( CDM ) project application to initiate emission reduction . Furthermore , the author attempted to ass , in quantitative term , the amount of CH ( 4 ) that would be emitted from landfill in the period from 1981-2024 using the IPCC 2006 FOD model . The total CH ( 4 ) emission using the IPCC 1996 model wa estimated to be 318.8 Gg in 2009 . The Northern region had the highest CH ( 4 ) emission inventory , with 128.8 Gg , whereas the Borneo region had the lowest , with 24.2 Gg . It wa estimated that Pulau Penang state produced the highest CH ( 4 ) emission , 77.6 Gg , followed by the remaining state with emission value ranging from 38.5 to 1.5 Gg . Based on the IPCC 1996 FOD model , the total Malaysian CH ( 4 ) emission wa forecast to be 397.7 Gg by 2020 . The IPCC 2006 FOD model estimated a 201 Gg CH ( 4 ) emission in 2009 , and estimate ranged from 98 Gg in 1981 to 263 Gg in 2024 .

aVBackground : Mass coral bleaching is increasing in scale and frequency across the world 's coral reef and is being driven primarily by increased level of thermal stress arising from global warming . In order to understand the impact of projected climate change upon coral reef , it is important to elucidate the underlying cellular mechanism that operate during coral bleaching and subsequent mortality . In this respect , increased apoptotic cell death activity is an important cellular process that is associated with the breakdown of the mutualistic symbiosis between the cnidarian host and their dinoflagellate symbionts . Methodology/Principal Findings : The present study report the impact of different stressor ( colchicine and heat stress ) on three phase of apoptosis : ( i ) the potential initiation by differential expression of Bcl-2 member , ( ii ) the execution of apoptotic event by activation of caspase 3-like protease and ( iii ) and finally , the cell disposal indicated by DNA fragmentation in the reef building coral Acropora millepora . In coral incubated with colchicine , an increase in caspase 3-like activity and DNA fragmentation wa associated with a relative down-regulation of Bcl-2 , suggesting that the initiation of apoptosis may be mediated by the suppression of an anti-apoptotic mechanism . In contrast , in the early step of heat stress , the induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis wa related to a relative up-regulation of Bcl-2 consecutively followed by a delayed decrease in apoptosis activity . Conclusions/Significance : In the light of these result , we propose a model of heat stress in coral host whereby increasing temperature engage activation of caspase 3-dependent apoptosis in cell designated for termination , but also the onset of a delayed protective response involving overexpression of Bcl-2 in surviving cell . This mitigating response to thermal stress could conceivably be an important regulatory mechanism for cell survival in coral exposed to sudden environmental change .

aVThe success of exotic specie can be influenced by both the abiotic environment and specie interaction . Many study have demonstrated significant effect of either type of factor on aspect of exotic success , but few have considered their relative effect on population growth rate , a more holistic measure of success . To quantify the relative effect of environment and direct competition on an exotic ascidian , Botrylloides violaceus , I manipulated direct contact interaction at four site with different abiotic environment and tracked individual colony over 3 year . I tested site and contact treatment effect on survival , growth and fecundity , and then conducted a life table response experiment on a periodic , size-structured population matrix model to test their effect on population growth rate . Both site and contact interaction were important to explaining variation in survival and growth . Contact interaction decreased the survival and growth of larger colony but unexpectedly increased the survival of small colony at some site , which led to relatively weaker and spatially variable effect on overall population growth rate . Site effect on population growth rate were an order of magnitude larger than contact effect , and site variation in winter vital rate made the largest contribution to change in population growth rate . The result of this study suggest that the abiotic environment play a larger role in the success of B. violaceus . Thus , environmental variable , such a temperature and salinity , could be used to predict this exotic specie ' success under different environmental scenario , including global climate change .

aVA very serious effort to modernize irrigation system is being made in Spain , to reduce water and energy loss in an environmentally sustainable way . This is expensive and it is important that the new irrigation system work properly over a long period . The system have been designed taking into account historical evapotranspiration ( ET ) average during the month of maximum demand , a well a the crop-specific ET value ( Kc coefficient ) of typical crop . However , the increase in ET rate due to global warming could mean that the capacity of these new and expensive irrigation system to fulfil the crop water requirement may be exceeded in the near future . However , the expected increase in CO , concentration could diminish crop transpiration rate for similar water demand from the atmosphere , thereby reducing irrigation requirement . A methodology wa developed in order to estimate crop water requirement under climate change condition . The reliability of a new irrigation system designed in Valladolid , Northern Spain wa tested . The regionalized climate change scenario for Valladolid , provided by the National Institute of Meteorology , were used for the period 2011-40 , 2041-70 and 2071-2100 and the A2 and B2 emission scenario were considered using the ECHAM and coupled general circulation model ( CGCM ) global circulation model . A historical series of daily meteorological data for Valladolid wa used to generate statistical ET distribution through the LARS-WG generator . Simulations considered each of the above period , global circulation model ( GCM ) and emission scenario . Furthermore , the Kc of the typical irrigated crop of the zone ( maize , potato and sugar beet ) were reduced for each period , GCM and emission scenario according to the relationship between CO ( 2 ) concentration and transpiration obtained by Kruijt et al . ( 2008 ) . The result indicated that , on average , historical ET rate provide a sufficiently robust indicator to enable estimation of the crop ET in the future , particularly considering the CO ( 2 ) effect in reducing crop transpiration . However , ET variability is significantly increased after 2040 , especially for the A2 emission scenario . The result show that ET variability rather than global increase is the most serious risk that current irrigation system must face in the near future in Northern Spain , a consequence of climate change . Such variability should be included in irrigation design .

aVRecognition that climate change could have negative consequence for agricultural production ha generated a desire to build resilience into agricultural system . One rational and cost-effective method may be the implementation of increased agricultural crop diversification . Crop diversification can improve resilience in a variety of way : by engendering a greater ability to suppress pest outbreak and dampen pathogen transmission , which may worsen under future climate scenario , a well a by buffering crop production from the effect of greater climate variability and extreme event . Such benefit point toward the obvious value of adopting crop diversification to improve resilience , yet adoption ha been slow . Economic incentive encouraging production of a select few crop , the push for biotechnology strategy , and the belief that monoculture are more productive than diversified system have been hindrance in promoting this strategy . However , crop diversification can be implemented in a variety of form and at a variety of scale , allowing farmer to choose a strategy that both increase resilience and provides economic benefit .

aVThe Chinese salt lake mega-region is controlled by an arid and semi-arid climate , and modern salt lake are mainly distributed within area with mean annual precipitation < 500 mm . According to their geomorphological feature , structural condition , and material composition , salt lake in China can be broadly divided into four region . The degree of exploitation and utilization of these salt lake differ because these four region have experienced different climatic change and structural activity and have had their own characteristic of salt lake evolution since the beginning of the Quaternary . The salt lake in these region have different scale , economic value , and technical condition for traffic . Among others , Jarantai ( Jartai ) Salt Lake and Yuncheng Salt Lake are better in term of comprehensive utilization and environmental protection , and the potash salt lake represented by Qarhan are most important in term of exploitation . At present , there exist many environmental problem in the salt lake region of China , especially in remote , small and medium-sized basin , where abusive or wasteful mining , low recovery , and mining of a single saline mineral have caused impoverishment and large quantity of byproduct . Furthermore , climatic environmental factor can also cause significant change of salt lake environment . Since 1987 , against the background of global warming , the climate in the northwest salt lake region ha turned warm and wet , and lake have exhibited a tendency for expansion and rise , whereas in the east of the region , the climate ha remained in a warm dry stage , lake level have dropped , and salt lake have become desertified . With the implementation of the strategy of building an environmentally friendly society in China , increasing attention is being paid to eco-environmental protection . It is suggested that experience and advanced technique in term of comprehensive utilization , overall development , and environmental protection of salt lake at home and abroad be further developed to strengthen observation and monitoring of environmental change of salt lake and build an environmentally friendly , great salt lake industry .

aVDeveloping and assessing successful strategy to alleviate adverse impact of climate warming present a new opportunity for sustainable agriculture and adaptation investment . Efforts to anticipate adaptation of cropping system may benefit from understanding the global warming effect within decade . This study quantitatively examines the temperature warming impact during , respectively , growing season and seed filling on soybean yield by using data from long-term field fertilisation experiment from 1987 to 2004 . Here we report that grain yield significantly decreased with rising temperature during growing season , whereas the effect of increasing temperature at seed-filling stage on crop yield were significantly positive . The result indicate that a further temperature increment during seed filling appears to decrease soybean system 's risk of yield reduction . Importantly , we inferred that earlier occurrence of seed filling would increase the temperature of this period . The implication is that advancing the onset of soybean seed filling could be an effective adaptation option to global warming , providing an average yield benefit of similar to 14 % per 10 day before the present date .

aVIt is unclear how the width and strength of the Hadley circulation are controlled and how they respond to climate change . Simulations of global warming scenario with comprehensive climate model suggest the Hadley circulation may widen and weaken a the climate warms . But these change are not quantitatively consistent among model , and how they come about is not understood . Here , a wide range of climate is simulated with an idealized moist general circulation model ( GCM ) coupled to a simple representation of ocean heat transport , in order to place past and possible future change in the Hadley circulation into a broader context and to investigate the mechanism responsible for them . By comparison of simulation with and without ocean heat transport , it is shown that it is essential to take low-latitude ocean heat transport and it coupling to wind stress into account to obtain Hadley circulation in a dynamical regime resembling Earth 's , particularly in climate resembling present-day Earth 's and colder . As the optical thickness of an idealized longwave absorber in the simulation is increased and the climate warms , the Hadley circulation strengthens in colder climate and weakens in warmer climate ; it ha maximum strength in a climate close to present-day Earth 's . In climate resembling present-day Earth 's and colder , the Hadley circulation strength is largely controlled by the divergence of angular momentum flux associated with eddy of midlatitude origin ; the latter scale with the mean available potential energy in midlatitudes . The importance of these eddy momentum flux for the Hadley circulation strength gradually diminishes a the climate warms . The Hadley circulation generally widens a the climate warms , but at a modest rate that depends sensitively on how it is determined .

aVLong-term carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) is currently considered a viable strategy for mitigating rising level of atmospheric CO ( 2 ) and associated impact of global climate change . Until recently , the significant below-ground CCS capacity of coastal vegetation such a seagrass , salt marsh , and mangrove ha largely gone unrecognized in model of global carbon transfer . However , this reservoir of natural , free , and sustainable carbon storage potential is increasingly jeopardized by alarming trend in coastal habitat loss , totalling 30-50 % of global abundance over the last century alone . Human intervention to restore lost habitat is a potentially powerful solution to improve natural rate of global CCS , but data suggest this approach is unlikely to substantially improve long-term CCS unless current restoration effort are increased to an industrial scale . Failure to do so raise the question of whether resource currently used for expensive and time-consuming restoration project would be more wisely invested in arresting further habitat loss and encouraging natural recovery .

aVRoot-zone temperature ( RZT ) change with season , geographical location and global warming . Nutrient accumulation and use behaviour of two maize ( Zea may L. ) genotype were evaluated under low ( 22.4 +/- 5 degree C ) and high ( 28.8 +/- 5 degree C ) root-zone temperature . In greenhouse study , hybrid maize ( FHY-396 ) and indigenous variety ( EV-7004 ) were sown in calcareous loam soil filled in pot . Shoot and root dry matter yield of both the genotype wa significantly ( p < 0.05 ) increased at the higher RZT . On an average , shoot dry matter at the higher RZT wa 38 % more for hybrid and 52 % for indigenous variety ( EV-7004 ) . Concentration and uptake of estimated nutrient ( P , K , Cu and Zn ) wa significantly ( p < 0.05 ) influenced by RZT . At the higher RZT , shoot concentration of both Cu and Zn were increased by about 30 % . There wa 1.5-fold increase in P , 1.4-fold increase in K , 1.9-fold increase in Cu and 1.8-fold increase in Zn uptake at the higher RZT . Nutrient uptake ( uptake g ( -1 ) root ) and use efficiency ( shoot utilization efficiency and usage index ) were significantly ( p < 0.05 ) increased at the higher RZT . Genotypes also differed significantly ( p < 0.05 ) for P and Zn utilization efficiency . Conclusively , RZT had a pronounced role in nutrient uptake from soil and their use by plant and hence on plant growth .

aVSampling error of the global mean sea level derived from TOPEX/Poseidon ( T/P ) altimetry are explored using 3 1/4 a of eddy-resolving numerical model output for sea level . By definition , the sampling error would not exist if data were available everywhere at all time . Four problem with increasing and progressively added complexity are examined to understand the cause of the sampling error . The first problem ( P1 ) explores the error incurred because T/P with turning latitude near 66 degree latitude doe not cover the entire globe . The second problem ( P2 ) examines , in addition , the spatial sampling issue because sample are only available along T/P ground track . The third problem ( P3 ) add the additional complexity that sea level at any along track location is sampled only once every 10 d versus every 3 d for the model ( i.e. , the temporal sampling issue ) . The fourth problem ( P4 ) incorporates the full complexity with the addition of real T/P data outage . The numerical model ( Los Alamos POP model Run 11 ) conserve the total water volume , thus generating no global mean sea level variation . Yet when the model sea level is sampled in the four problem ( with P4 using the real T/P sampling ) , variation occur a manifestation of the sampling error . The result show root-mean-squares ( rms ) sampling error for P1 of 0.67 ( 0.75 ) mm for 10 d ( 3 d ) global mean sea level , 0.78 ( 0.86 ) mm for P2 , 0.79 mm for P3 , and 1.07 mm for P4 , whereas the amplitude of the sampling error can be a large a 2.0 ( 2.7 ) mm for P1 , 2.1 ( 2.7 ) mm for P2 , 2.2 mm for P3 , and 2.5 mm for P4 . The result clearly show the largest source of the sampling error to be the lack of global coverage ( i.e. , P1 ) , which the model ha actually underestimated due to it own less-than-global coverage ( between latitude about 77 degree latitude ) . We have extrapolated that a truly global model would show the rms sampling error to be 1.14 ( 1.28 ) mm for P1 , thus implying a substantially larger sampling error for P4 .

aVThe green revolution ha yet to be realized in Sub-Saharan Africa ( SSA ) even 40 year after it success in tropical Asia , suggesting that there wa a missing element in the basic principle underlying the Asian green revolution when they were transferred to SSA . The author argue that this missing element is 'ecotechnology ' . Ecotechnology improves the crop growing environment in farmer ' field and enables them to accommodate basic green revolution technology such a modern variety , chemical fertilizer and irrigation facility . The author focus on sawah ecotechnology , a sustainable rice production technology . The term 'sawah ' refers to a levelled , bunded and puddled rice field under controlled submergence , and 'sawah ecotechnology ' indicates the technology for designing , developing and managing the sawah system . The sawah system development potential is at least 20 million ha in the West Africa ( WA ) subregion only . Realizing this potential , WA can sustainably produce food for more than 300 million people , a well a enabling the conservation and restoration of hundred of million of hectare of upland forest , contributing to carbon sequestration and global warming mitigation in the future .

aVRecent visit by Humboldt squid ( Dosidicus gigas ) to the northern California Current system ( CCS ) were suggested to be related to larger climatic event such a El Nino , global warming , and expansion and shoaling of the oxygen minimum zone . Due to their plasticity in foraging behavior , coupled with an increased availability of prey resource , these excursion may also represent opportunistic foraging exploration . Fisheries-independent survey initiated by the Northwest Fisheries Science Center in 1998 first encountered Humboldt squid in coastal water off central Oregon and Washington in 2004 . Squid ranging from 36-79 cm mantle length were caught during the following six year of sampling ( 2004-2009 ) , with individual generally increasing in abundance shoreward in late summer . The highest observed density were in 2009 and measured 1,671 squid ( 10 ( 6 ) m ( 3 ) ) ( -1 ) . Physical feature associated with increased squid catch included station depth , subsurface water temperature , ocean salinity , ocean density , and dissolved oxygen . In addition , the arrival of Humboldt squid onto the shelf in late summer wa coincident with decline of juvenile ( 10-30 cm total length ) Pacific hake ( Merluccius productus ) , in contrast to the typical increase of hake recorded in late summer during recent year . Our result suggest that predator-prey interaction and ocean condition in the CCS epipelagic zone lead to seasonal expansion , yet unsuccessful colonization attempt , by Humboldt squid population . Identifying the economic and ecological impact of this newly arrived predator should be a top research priority .

aVGeological and hydrographic record contain evidence of substantial past variation in the oxygenation of the global ocean . Numerical model predicts a future decrease of marine oxygen level under global warming . Using a global biogeochemical-climate model in which diapycnal mixing is parametrised a the sum of the regionally heterogenous tidal and homogenous background vertical mixing , we here show that simulated total oceanic oxygen content and the extent of marine suboxia are both sensitive to the strength of background vertical mixing . Eight otherwise identical configuration of the model were spun up under pre-industrial condition for different vertical diffusivities ranging from background value of 0.01 cm ( 2 ) /s to 0.5 cm ( 2 ) /s . This range corresponds to various observational estimate and to value currently used in numerical ocean circulation model . Whereas the simulated total oceanic oxygen content is larger for larger mixing intensity , the simulated suboxic volume display a maximum at intermediate diffusivities of about 0.2 cm ( 2 ) /s . The intensity of vertical mixing also determines the evolution of suboxic area under projected 21st century CO ( 2 ) emission : while all model configuration predict a decline in total oceanic oxygen , the simulated extent of marine suboxia show a 21st century expansion only for mixing rate higher than 0.2 cm ( 2 ) /s , whereas the suboxic volume decline for lower mixing rate despite an overall loss of marine oxygen . Differences in the poorly constrained mixing parameterisation can thus lead to qualitatively different estimate about the future evolution of marine suboxia under projected climate change .

aVClimate change induced by recent global warming may have a significant impact on vector-borne and zoonotic disease . For example , the distribution of Japanese encephalitis virus ( JEV ) ha expanded into new region . We surveyed the level of hemagglutination-inhibition ( HI ) antibody against JEV ( Family Flaviviridae , genus Flavivirus ) in wild bird captured in Korea . Blood sample were collected from 1,316 wild bird including the following migratory bird : Oceanodroma castro ( n = 4 ) , Anas formosa ( n = 7 ) , Anas penelope ( n = 20 ) , Fulica atra ( n = 30 ) , Anas acuta ( n = 89 ) , Anas crecca ( n = 154 ) , Anas platyrhynchos ( n = 214 ) , Aix galericulata ( n = 310 ) , and Anas poecilorhyncha ( n = 488 ) . All were captured in 16 location in several Korea province between April 2007 and December 2009 . Out of the 1,316 serum sample tested , 1,141 ( 86.7 % ) were positive for JEV . Wild bird captured in 2009 had a higher seroprevalence of ant-JEV antibody than those captured in 2007 . Wild bird with an HI antibody titer of 1 : 1,280 or higher accounted for 21.2 % ( 280/1,316 ) of the animal tested . These finding indicated that wild bird from the region examined in our study have been exposed to JEV and may pose a high risk for introducing a new JEV genotype into Korea .

aVPhenological mismatch due to climate change may have important ecological consequence . In a three-year study , phenological shift due to experimental warming markedly altered trophic relationship between plant and insect herbivore , causing a dramatic decline of reproductive capacity for one of the plant specie . In a Tibetan meadow , the gentian ( Gentiana formosa ) typically flower after the peak larva density of a noctuid moth ( Melanchra pisi ) that primarily feed on a dominant forb ( anemone , Anemone trullifolia var . linearis ) . However , artificial warming of similar to 1.5 degree C advanced gentian flower phenology and anemone vegetative phenology by a week , but delayed moth larva emergence by two week . The warming increased larval density 10-fold , but decreased anemone density by 30 % . The phenological and density shift under warmed condition resulted in the insect larva feeding substantially on the gentian flower and ovule ; there wa similar to 100-fold more damage in warmed than in unwarmed chamber . This radically increased trophic connection reduced gentian plant reproduction and likely contributed to it reduced abundance in the warmed chamber .

aVPalaeoecological study ( including analysis of pollen , macrofossils , geochemistry , and AMS radiocarbon date ) of four peat section from one low-centred ice-wedge polygon in NE Yakutia ( NE Siberia ) allow the three-dimensional reconstruction of polygon development during the last ca 1250 year . After drainage of a lake , peat forming vegetation invaded rapidly . Comparison with palaeotemperature data show that the initial formation of mature ridge coincided with a period of high summer temperature around AD 1400 . The ridge persisted and expanded during the subsequent colder ca 200 year . Partial collapse of various ridge at the end of the 18th century corresponded to a phase with low summer temperature . During the warm , 20th century one collapsed ridge regenerated , whereas another persisted in it collapsed state . Ice-wedge polygon are , thus , complex and highly dynamic ecosystem , in which change in temperature and precipitation may induce rapid ecological change by the complex interplay of water , ice and vegetation . Our study indicates that global warming associated with a decrease in summer precipitation may initially result in enhanced polygon ridge formation . The combination of longer summer and increased winter precipitation , a predicted for high latitude will , however , eventually result in larger meltwater input in the polygon mire , which may cause the ( partial ) collapse of polygon ridge and underlying ice-wedges .

aVOver the past 3 decade the Arctic ha seen substantial warming . Previous local to regional scale study have shown a considerable reduction in the size of lake in this region . The subsequent exposure of carbon- and methane-rich sediment and the direct change in surface albedo feed back into the driver of regional and global climate change . Understanding and quantifying change in the Arctic is a critical component of climate modeling due to the cooling effect of the Arctic on the global climate . The current work utilizes global satellite data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer ( MODIS ) instrument to investigate change in lake across Canada between 2000 and 2009 . The result show a net reduction of more than 6,700 km ( 2 ) in the surface area of water in lake across Canada . Modest gain in the southern region are offset by larger loss in surface area farther north . Additionally , spatial analysis show that the lake showing change are clustered in group . This suggests that local variability may play a role in the observed change . Further work is needed to extend the analysis to the circumpolar Arctic . Citation : Carroll , M. L. , J. R. G.

aVA precipitation typing algorithm wa applied to climate model simulation in order to investigate the effect of global warming on the occurrence of freezing rain over North America . The model used in the study wa the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis ' CGCM3 . Two realization of the present-day ( 1981-2000 ) climate and two realization of a global warming ( 2081-2100 ) simulation were run using scenario A2 from the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios ( SRES ) prepared by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) . The algorithm wa applied to the four twenty-year period in order to determine the change in the number and distribution of freezing rain event . The model result indicate that the present-day freezing rain maximum over eastern North America will shift poleward and weaken with the result that freezing rain event will decrease significantly in the eastern United States and the Atlantic Provinces . To the north of the maximum and over central Canada there will be modest increase in freezing rain . When averaged over North America , there will be an overall decrease in freezing rain event with global warming .

aVFires in tropical forest release globally significant amount of carbon to the atmosphere and may increase in importance a a result of climate change . Despite the striking impact of fire on tropical ecosystem , the paucity of robust spatial model of forest fire still hamper our ability to simulate tropical forest fire regime today and in the future . Here we present a probabilistic model of human-induced fire occurrence for the Amazon that integrates the effect of a series of anthropogenic factor with climatic condition described by vapor pressure deficit . The model wa calibrated using NOAA-12 night satellite hot pixel for 2003 and validated for the year 2002 , 2004 , and 2005 . Assessment of the fire risk map yielded fitness value > 85 % for all month from 2002 to 2005 . Simulated fire exhibited high overlap with NOAA-12 hot pixel regarding both spatial and temporal distribution , showing a spatial fit of 50 % within a radius of 11 km and a maximum yearly frequency deviation of 15 % . We applied this model to simulate fire regime in the Amazon until 2050 using IPCC 's A2 scenario climate data from the Hadley Centre model and a business-as-usual ( BAU ) scenario of deforestation and road expansion from SimAmazonia . Results show that the combination of these scenario may double forest fire occurrence outside protected area ( PAs ) in year of extreme drought , expanding the risk of fire even to the northwestern Amazon by midcentury . In particular , forest fire may increase substantially across southern and southwestern Amazon , especially along the highway slated for paving and in agricultural zone . Committed emission from Amazon forest fire and deforestation under a scenario of global warming and uncurbed deforestation may amount to 21 +/- 4 Pg of carbon by 2050 . BAU deforestation may increase fire occurrence outside PAs by 19 % over the next four decade , while climate change alone may account for a 12 % increase . In turn , the combination of climate change and deforestation would boost fire occurrence outside PAs by half during this period . Our modeling result , therefore , confirm the synergy between the two Ds of REDD ( Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries ) .

aVThe Middle Pliocene ( ca 3.12-2.97 Ma ) is a recent warm period in the Earth 's history . In many respect , the warmth of the Middle Pliocene is similar to the probable warm situation of the late 21st century predicted by climate model . Understanding the Middle Pliocene climate is important in predicting the future climate with global warming . Here , we used the latest reconstruction for the Middle Pliocene-Pliocene Research Interpretation and Synoptic Mapping ( PRISM ) version 3-to simulate the Middle Pliocene climate with a fully coupled model Fast Ocean Atmosphere Model . From comparison of the result of simulation with reconstruction , we considered two important scientific topic of Middle Pliocene climate modeling : extreme warming in the subpolar North Atlantic and a permanent El Nio in the tropical Pacific . Our simulation illustrate that the global annual mean sea surface temperature ( SST ) in the Middle Pliocene wa about 2.3A degree C higher than that in the pre-industrial era . The warming wa stronger at mid- and high latitude than at low latitude . The simulated SST change agree with SST reconstruction in PRISM3 data , especially for the North Atlantic , North Pacific and west coast of South America . However , there were still discrepancy between the simulation of the SST and reconstruction for the subpolar North Atlantic and tropical Pacific . In the case of the Atlantic , the weakened meridional overturning circulation in the simulation did not support the reconstruction of the extremely warm condition in the subpolar North Atlantic . In the case of the tropical Pacific , the whole ocean warmed , especially the eastern tropical Pacific , which did not support the permanent El Nio suggested by the reconstruction . From evaluation of the modeling and reconstruction , we suggest that the above discrepancy were due to uncertainty in reconstruction , difficulty in paleoclimate modeling and deficiency of climate model . The discrepancy should be reduced through consideration of both the modeling and data .

aVThe drastic reduction of carbon emission to combat global climate change can not be realized without a significant contribution from the electricity sector . Renewable energy resource must take a bigger share in the generation mix , effective demand response must be widely implemented , and high-capacity energy storage system must be developed . A smart grid is necessary to manage and control the increasingly complex future grid . Certain smart grid elements-renewables , storage , microgrid , consumer choice , and smart appliances-increase uncertainty in both supply and demand of electric power . Other smart gird elements-sensors , smart meter , demand response , and communications-provide more accurate information about the power system and more refined mean of control . Simply building hardware for renewable generator and the smart grid , but still using the same operating paradigm of the grid , will not realize the full potential for overall system efficiency and carbon reduction . In this paper , a new operating paradigm , called risk-limiting dispatch , is proposed . It treat generation a a heterogeneous commodity of intermittent or stochastic power and us information and control to design hedging technique to manage the risk of uncertainty .

aVWintertime climate around Hokkaido is highly sensitive to fluctuation in snow and sea-ice . We examined future climate change in heavy snowfall region around Hokkaido , using the Pseudo-Global-Warming method ( PGW ) by a regional climate model . The boundary condition of the PGW run were obtained by adding the difference between the future ( 2090s ) and past ( 1990s ) climate simulated by coupled general circulation model , into the 6-hourly reanalysis and daily sea surface temperature data . The PGW experiment show that snow depth decrease significantly over mountainous area . However , snow cover decrease mainly over plain area , which accelerates surface warming due to the decreased snow albedo . Despite the snow reduction , precipitation increase over the mountainous area because of enhanced water vapor content . However , precipitation decrease over the Japan Sea and neighboring the coastal area , suggesting a weakening of the convergent cloud band which is formed by convergence between cold northwesterly from the Eurasian continent and anticyclonic circulation over the Okhotsk Sea . Our result indicate the contrasting cloud response to future climate change over the Japan and Okhotsk Seas in term of meso-scale climate system .

aVFirst generation climate-carbon cycle model suggest that climate change will suppress carbon accumulation in soil , and could even lead to a net loss of global soil carbon over the next century . These model result are qualitatively consistent with soil carbon projection published by Jenkinson almost two decade ago . More recently there ha been a suggestion that the release of heat associated with soil decomposition , which is neglected in the vast majority of large-scale model , may be critically important under certain circumstance . Models with and without the extra self-heating from microbial respiration have been shown to yield significantly different result . The present paper present a mathematical analysis of a tipping point or runaway feedback that can arise when the heat from microbial respiration is generated more rapidly than it can escape from the soil to the atmosphere . This 'compost-bomb instability ' is most likely to occur in drying organic soil with high porosity covered by an insulating lichen or moss layer . However , the instability is also found to be strongly dependent on the rate of global warming . This paper derives the condition required to trigger the compost-bomb instability , and discus the relevance of these to the concept of dangerous rate of climate change . On the basis of simple numerical experiment , rate of long-term warming equivalent to 10 degree C per century could be sufficient to trigger compost-bomb instability in drying organic soil .

aVThis study evaluated the effectiveness of using Thematic Mapper ( TM ) data for estimating soil organic carbon ( SOC ) content in the Zarqa Basin , Jordan , a typical semi-arid environment , and under natural surface condition by testing a variety of statistical modeling technique . This is essential for implementing carbon crediting program for ameliorating the effect of global warming . Although none of the developed model wa powerful in predicting SOC , a stepwise regression model wa selected since it provided the lowest validation root mean square error ( RMSE ) of 10.4 metric ton per hectare ( ton/ha ) . Using this model , a SOC map for the basin wa constructed by applying map algebra . The total SOC content to 0.2 m depth of the basin wa calculated to be 9,423,986.4 metric ton with SOC density of 26.3 ton/ha . This study suggested that , in semi-arid environment and using the statistical modeling technique that were tested , TM-based SOC model can not be used for implementing carbon crediting program ; however , they can estimate total surface SOC pool in large area to within a few percent error .

aVThe influence of global warming on soil organic matter ( SOM ) dynamic in terrestrial ecosystem remains unclear . In this study , we combined soil fractionation with isotope analysis to examine SOM dynamic after nine year of experimental warming in a North America tallgrass prairie . Soil sample from the control plot and the warmed plot were separated into four aggregate size ( > 2000 mu m , 250-2000 mu m , 53-250 mu m , and < 53 mu m ) , and three density fraction ( free light fraction - LF , intra-aggregate particulate organic matter - iPOM , and mineral-associated organic matter - mSOM ) . All fraction were analyzed for their carbon ( C ) and nitrogen ( N ) content , and delta ( 13 ) C and delta ( 15 ) N value . Warming did not significantly effect soil aggregate distribution and stability but increased C ( 4 ) -derived C input into all fraction with the greatest in LF . Warming also stimulated decay rate of C in whole soil and all aggregate size . C in LF turned over faster than that in iPOM in the warmed soil . The delta ( 15 ) N value of soil fraction were more enriched in the warmed soil than those in the control , indicating that warming accelerated loss of soil N. The delta ( 15 ) N value changed from low to high , while C : N ratio changed from high to low in the order LF , iPOM , and mSOM due to increased degree of decomposition and mineral association . Overall , warming increased the input of C ( 4 ) -derived C by 11.6 % , which wa offset by the accelerated loss of soil C. Our result suggest that global warming simultaneously stimulates C input via shift in specie composition and decomposition of SOM , resulting in negligible net change in soil C .

aVSoil warming ha the potential to alter both soil and plant process that affect carbon storage in forest ecosystem . We have quantified these effect in a large , long-term ( 7-y ) soil-warming study in a deciduous forest in New England . Soil warming ha resulted in carbon loss from the soil and stimulated carbon gain in the woody tissue of tree . The warming-enhanced decay of soil organic matter also released enough additional inorganic nitrogen into the soil solution to support the observed increase in plant carbon storage . Although soil warming ha resulted in a cumulative net loss of carbon from a New England forest relative to a control area over the 7-y study , the annual net loss generally decreased over time a plant carbon storage increased . In the seventh year , warming-induced soil carbon loss were almost totally compensated for by plant carbon gain in response to warming . We attribute the plant gain primarily to warming-induced increase in nitrogen availability . This study underscore the importance of incorporating carbon-nitrogen interaction in atmosphere-ocean-land earth system model to accurately simulate land feedback to the climate system .

aVThe use of highly reflective `` cool '' roofing material can decrease demand for air conditioning , mitigate the urban heat island effect , and potentially slow global warming . However , initially high roof solar reflectance can be degraded by natural soiling and weathering process . We evaluated solar reflectance loss after three year of natural exposure reported in two separate database : the Rated Products Directory of the US Cool Roof Rating Council ( CRRC ) and information reported by manufacturer to the US Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) 's ENERGY STAR ( R ) rating program . Many product rating were culled because they were duplicative ( within a database ) or not measured . A second , site-resolved version of the CRRC dataset wa created by transcribing from paper record the site-specific measurement of aged solar reflectance in Florida , Arizona and Ohio . Products with high initial solar reflectance tended to lose reflectance , while those with very low initial solar reflectance tended to become more reflective a they aged . Within the site-resolved CRRC database , absolute solar reflectance loss for sample of medium-to-high initial solar reflectance were 2-3 time greater in Florida ( hot and humid ) than in Arizona ( hot and dry ) ; loss in Ohio ( temperate but polluted ) were intermediate . Disaggregating result by product type factory-applied coating , field-applied coating , metal , modified bitumen , shingle , single-ply membrane and tile revealed that absolute solar reflectance loss were largest for field-applied coating , modified bitumen and single-ply membrane product , and smallest for factory-applied coating and metal product . The 2008 Title 24 provisional aged solar reflectance formula overpredicts the measured aged solar reflectance of 0-30 % of each product type in the culled public CRRC database . The rate of overprediction wa greatest for field-applied coating and single-ply membrane product and least for factory-applied coating , shingle , and metal product . New product-specific formula of the form rho ' ( a ) = 0.20+beta ( rho ( i ) -0.20 ) can be used to estimate provisional aged solar reflectance rho ' ( a ) from initial solar reflectance rho ( i ) pending measurement of aged solar reflectance . The appropriate value of soiling resistance beta varies by product type and is selected to attain some desired overprediction rate for the formula . The correlation for shingle product presented in this paper should not be used to predict aged solar reflectance or estimate provisional aged solar reflectance because the data set is too small and too limited in range of initial solar reflectance .

aVBiodiesel is at present considered to be the best alternative to the fossil fuel . Due to a closed carbon cycle , it doe not cause greenhouse effect and it use can help fighting global warming . A large number of method have been developed and suggested for the production of biodiesel ( Fatty acid methyl ester ) from vegetable oil and animal fat . At present , biodiesel is mostly produced by reacting methanol and vegetable oil in a batch reactor using a liquid alkaline catalyst . The catalyst can not be recovered from the reactor and is instead neutralized and disposed of a a waste stream . A heterogeneously-catalyzed process of transesterification would offer a number of advantage over the current technology , such a simplification of the catalyst removal step and economization of the process through regeneration/recycling of the catalyst . Recently , the successful us of alumina loaded with various oxide and nitrate a solid catalyst are reported . The present work report the transesterification of Shaddock oil with methanol in presence of solid KI loaded gamma-Al ( 2 ) O ( 3 ) catalyst . Effects of various parameter such a reaction time , concentration of the catalyst etc . on the yield were also studied . Highest conversion rate of the seed oil to it methyl ester wa obtained under the condition of KI loading of 15 w/w % , calcination temperature at 473K , 8h of reaction time at 338K and 3w/w % catalyst and 12:1 molar ratio of methanol in oil .

aVIn many part of the world , climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of heat wave . How do heat wave impact short-lived poikilotherm such a insect ? In the cricket , Gryllus texensis , 6. day of elevated temperature ( i.e . 7 degree C above the average field temperature and 5 degree C above their preferred temperature ) resulted in increased egg laying , faster egg development and greater mass gain . The increased temperature also increased activity of phenoloxidase and lysozyme-like enzyme , two immune-related enzyme , and enhanced resistance to the Gram-negative bacterium Serratia marcescens . When given a sublethal S. marcescens infection , G. texensis maintained increased reproductive output at the elevated temperature ( 33 degree C ) . These data suggest that heat wave could result in more numerous , disease resistant , cricket . However , resistance to the Gram-positive bacterium , Bacillus cereus wa lower at temperature above or below the average field temperature ( 26 degree C ) . A sublethal infection with B. cereus reduced egg laying at all temperature and suppressed the increase in egg laying induced by higher temperature . These result suggest that for some species-pathogen interaction , increased temperature can induce trade-off between reproduction and disease resistance . This result may partly explain why G. texensis prefers temperature lower than those that produce maximal reproductive output and enhanced immune function .

aVSpatial trend and comparative change in time of selected trace element were studied in liver tissue from polar bear from ten different subpopulation location in Alaska , Canadian Arctic and East Greenland . For nine of the trace element ( As , Cd , Cu , Hg , Mn , Pb , Rb , Se and Zn ) spatial trend were investigated in 136 specimen sampled during 2005-2008 from bear from these ten subpopulation . Concentrations of Hg , Se and As were highest in the ( northern and southern ) Beaufort Sea area and lowest in ( western and southern ) Hudson Bay area and Chukchi/Bering Sea . In contrast , concentration of Cd showed an increasing trend from east to west . Minor or no spatial trend were observed for Cu , Mn , Rb and Zn . Spatial trend were in agreement with previous study , possibly explained by natural phenomenon . To ass temporal change of Cd , Hg , Se and Zn concentration during the last decade , we compared our result to previously published data . These time comparison suggested recent Hg increase in East Greenland polar bear . This may be related to Hg emission and/or climate-induced change in Hg cycle or change in the polar bear food web related to global warming . Also , Hg : Se molar ratio ha increased in East Greenland polar bear , which suggests there may be an increased risk for Hg ( 2+ ) -mediated toxicity . Since the underlying reason for spatial trend or change in time of trace element in the Arctic are still largely unknown , future study should focus on the role of changing climate and trace metal emission on geographical and temporal trend of trace element .

aVDetailed estimate of carbon dioxide emission at fine spatial scale are critical to both modeler and decision maker dealing with global warming and climate change . Globally , traffic-related emission of carbon dioxide are growing rapidly . This paper present a new method based on a multiple linear regression model to disaggregate traffic-related CO ( 2 ) emission estimate from the parish-level scale to a 1 x 1 km grid scale . Considering the allocation factor ( population density , urban area , income , road density ) together , we used a correlation and regression analysis to determine the relationship between these factor and traffic-related CO ( 2 ) emission , and developed the best-fit model . The method wa applied to downscale the traffic-related CO ( 2 ) emission value by parish ( i.e . county ) for the State of Louisiana into 1-km ( 2 ) grid cell . In the four highest parish in traffic-related CO ( 2 ) emission , the biggest area that ha above average CO ( 2 ) emission is found in East Baton Rouge , and the smallest area with no CO ( 2 ) emission is also in East Baton Rouge , but Orleans ha the most CO ( 2 ) emission per unit area . The result reveals that high CO ( 2 ) emission are concentrated in dense road network of urban area with high population density and low CO ( 2 ) emission are distributed in rural area with low population density , sparse road network . The proposed method can be used to identify the emission `` hot spot '' at fine scale and is considered more accurate and le time-consuming than the previous method . ( C ) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

aVNitrous oxide ( N ( 2 ) O ) is a significant greenhouse gas with a global warming potential that is 300 time than that of carbon dioxide . Soil derived N ( 2 ) O emission usually display a high degree of spatial and temporal variability because of their dependence on soil chemical and physical property , and climate dependent environmental factor . However , there is little research that incorporates spatial dependence in the estimation of N ( 2 ) O emission allowing for environmental factor in the same model . This study aim to examine the impact of two environmental factor ( soil temperature and soil moisture ) on N ( 2 ) O emission and explore the spatial structure of N ( 2 ) O in the sub-tropical South East Queensland region of Australia . The replicated data on N ( 2 ) O emission and soil property were collected at a typical sugarcane land site covering 25 uniform grid point across 3600 m ( 2 ) between October 2007 and September 2008 . A Bayesian conditional autoregressive ( CAR ) model wa used to model spatial dependence . Results showed that soil moisture and soil temperature appeared to have substantially different effect on N ( 2 ) O emission after taking spatial dependence into account in the four season . There wa a substantial variation in the spatial distribution of N ( 2 ) O emission in the different season . The high N ( 2 ) O emission region were accompanied by high uncertainty and changed in varying season in this study site . Spatial CAR model might be more plausible to elucidate and account for the uncertainty arising from unclear variable and spatial variability in the assessment of N ( 2 ) O emission in soil , and more accurately identify relationship with key environmental factor and help to reduce the uncertainty of the soil parameter .

aVThis study analyzed the temporal precipitation variation in the arid Central Asia ( ACA ) and their regional difference during 1930-2009 using monthly gridded precipitation from the Climatic Research Unit ( CRU ) . Our result showed that the annual precipitation in this westerly circulation dominated arid region is generally increasing during the past 80 year , with an apparent increasing trend ( 0.7 mm/10 a ) in winter . The precipitation variation in ACA also differ regionally , which can be divided into five distinct subregions ( I West Kazakhstan region , II East Kazakhstan region , III Central Asia Plains region , IV Kyrgyzstan region , and V Iran Plateau region ) . The annual precipitation fall fairly even on all season in the two northern subregions ( region I and II , approximately north of 45A degree N ) , whereas the annual precipitation is falling mainly on winter and spring ( accounting for up to 80 % of the annual total precipitation ) in the three southern subregions . The annual precipitation is increasing on all subregions except the southwestern ACA ( subregion V ) during the past 80 year . A significant increase in precipitation appeared in subregions I and III . The long-term trend in annual precipitation in all subregions are determined mainly by trend in winter precipitation . Additionally , the precipitation in ACA ha significant interannual variation . The 2-3-year cycle is identified in all subregions , while the 5-6-year cycle is also found in the three southern subregions . Besides the inter-annual variation , there were 3-4 episodic precipitation variation in all subregions , with the latest episodic change that started in the mid- to late 1970s . The precipitation in most of the study region are fast increasing since the late 1970s . Overall , the response of ACA precipitation to global warming are complicated . The variation of westerly circulation are likely the major factor that influence the precipitation variation in the study region .

aVIn documenting biological response to climate change , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ha used phenology study from many part of the world , but data from the high latitude of North America are missing . In the present article , we evaluate climate trend and the corresponding change in sequential bloom time for seven plant specie in the central parkland of Alberta , Canada ( latitude 52 degrees-57 degree north ) . For the study period of 71 year ( 1936-2006 ) , we found a substantial warming signal , which ranged from an increase of 5.3 degree Celsius ( degree C ) in the mean monthly temperature for February to an increase of 1.5 degree C in those for May . The earliest-blooming specie ' ( Populus tremuloides and Anemone patens ) bloom date advanced by two week during the seven decade , whereas the later-blooming specie ' bloom date advanced between zero and six day . The early-blooming specie ' bloom date advanced faster than wa predicted by thermal time model , which we attribute to decreased diurnal temperature fluctuation . This unexpectedly sensitive response result in an increased exposure to late-spring frost .

aVIn an earlier global climate-change study , air temperature and precipitation data for the entire twenty-first century simulated from five general circulation model were used a input to precalibrated watershed model for 14 selected basin across the United States . Simulated daily streamflow and energy output from the watershed model were used to compute a range of statistic . With a side-by-side comparison of the statistical analysis for the 14 basin , regional climatic and hydrologic trend over the twenty-first century could be qualitatively identified . Low-flow statistic ( 95 % exceedance , 7-day mean annual minimum , and summer mean monthly streamflow ) decreased for almost all basin . Annual maximum daily streamflow also decreased in all the basin , except for all four basin in California and the Pacific Northwest . An analysis of the supply of available energy and water for the basin indicated that ratio of evaporation to precipitation and potential evapotranspiration to precipitation for most of the basin will increase . Probability density function ( PDFs ) were developed to ass the uncertainty and multimodality in the impact of climate change on mean annual streamflow variability . Kolmogorov-Smirnov test showed significant difference between the beginning and ending twenty-first-century PDFs for most of the basin , with the exception of four basin that are located in the western United States . Almost none of the basin PDFs were normally distributed , and two basin in the upper Midwest had PDFs that were extremely dispersed and skewed .

aVUnderstanding the global climate change from greenhouse to icehouse condition at the Eocene-Oligocene Transition ( DOT ) 34 million year ago requires climatic record from oceanic a well a continental realm of the key Late Eocene `` doubthouse '' period preceding this switch . Here , we report integrated stratigraphic result from well-dated Late Eocene continental mudflat to saline lake paleoenvironments of the Xining Basin ( northeastern Tibetan Plateau , western China ) recording regional and global change . Cyclostratigraphic analysis strongly suggests continuous dominance of the 41-kyr obliquity cycle in the whole late Eocene interval down to the base of polarity chron C18n.2n at 39 Ma with additional input of the similar to 100-kyr eccentricity cycle up to the base of chron C13r at similar to 34.7 Ma . This might imply that high-latitude climate dominated the area long before the EOT , probably related to incipient ice-volume fluctuation . Furthermore , our result reveal two paleoenvironmental deterioration step preceding the Eocene-Oligocene Transition . The first step occurs in the top of chron C17n.ln at similar to 36.6 Ma . This age closely corresponds to ( 1 ) the high-altitude pollen appearance in chron Cl 6.2r at similar to 36.4 Ma in the same section , ( 2 ) the recently dated final retreat of the Tarim Sea in western China , and ( 3 ) a shift from precession to obliquity dominance in the Atlantic Ocean . This near co-occurrence suggests global change at this time . We hypothesize this change is related to an increase in incipient ice sheet volume leading to passing threshold condition for the high-altitude pollen appearance and Tarim Sea retreat , finally leading to decreased moisture availability in the Xining Basin . At the second step , in the base of chron C13r at similar to 34.7 Ma . a substantial increase in clastic sedimentation rate is observed . This might relate to increased climate variability preceding the greenhouse to icehouse transition at the EOT that prevented landscape to attain equilibrium configuration . ( c ) 2010 Elsevier By .

aVRecent study using single environmental variable show that under aerobic condition terrestrial plant can emit methane ( CH ( 4 ) ) . However , the effect of multiple environmental factors-as component of global climate change-on aerobic CH ( 4 ) emission have been little studied . We examined the combined effect of temperature , carbon dioxide ( CO ( 2 ) ) and watering regime on CH ( 4 ) emission from six commonly cultivated crop specie : faba bean , sunflower , pea , canola , barley and wheat . Plants were grown from seed in controlled-environment growth chamber under two temperature regime ( 24 degree C day/20 degree C night and 30 degree C day/26 degree C night ) , two CO ( 2 ) concentration ( 380 and 760 mmol mol ( -1 ) ) and two watering regime ( well watered and water stressed ) . Plants were grown first under 24/20 degree C for 1 week from sowing , and then placed under experimental condition for a further week . After the specified time , plant growth , gas exchange and CH ( 4 ) emission rate were determined . Our result revealed that higher temperature and water stress significantly enhance CH ( 4 ) emission from plant , whereas elevated CO ( 2 ) had the opposite effect and partially revers the promotive effect of these factor . We suggest that the despite the mitigating effect of rising atmospheric CO ( 2 ) , CH ( 4 ) emission may be higher in the face of ongoing global climate change in warmer and drier environment .

aVCoral reef provide a valuable habitat for many economically valuable fish and invertebrate . However , they are in serious jeopardy , threatened by increasing over-exploitation , pollution , habitat destruction , disease and global climate change . Here , we examined the effect of cryoprotectant exposure on mitochondrial activity and membrane potential ( psi m ) in coral oocytes.in order to find suitable cryoprotectants towards their successful cryopreservation . According to the No Observed Effect Concentrations ( NOECs ) , methanol wa found to be the least toxic cryoprotectant whilst DMSO wa the most toxic cryoprotectant . The result also demonstrated that there were no significant difference ( p > 0.05 ) in ATP concentration between Junceella juncea and Junceella fragilis after exposure to all concentration of all cryoprotectants for 30 min . Using confocal microscopy , JC-1 ( 5,50,6,60-tetrachloro-1,10,3,30-tetraethyl-imidacarbocyanine iodide ) staining indicated that the mitochondrial membrane potential of Junceella fragilis oocyte reduced after 1 M and 2 M methanol treatment and a loss of the mitochondrial distribution pattern and poor green fluorescence after 3M methanol treatment . Therefore , even oocyte that show no adverse effect of cryoprotectants on survival might suffer some more subtle impact . The result obtained from this study will provide a basis for development of protocol to cryopreserve the oocyte of gorgonian coral .

aVSugarcane grower can make disproportionately large contribution to the great global issue of carbon sequestration to combat global warming , and to the provisioning ( in the broadest sense ) of the burgeoning population of Africa and S/SE Asia . The key to both is a substantial increase of Soil Organic Matter ( SOM ) ; increasing level worldwide by one-third would deplete atmospheric CO ( 2 ) level to near zero . Sugarcane grower can play their part through embracing trash mulching and minimum tillage ; but additional field experiment are needed to define best technique . Increased SOM will improve yield and water-use efficiency , and reduce erosion . The ultimate development of increasing SOM and , thus , fertility is the burying of biochar , a technology that ha been demonstrated ( the terra preta soil ) in Amazonia for over a millennium . The sugar industry is exceptionally well placed to promote the use of biochar - albeit on a scale which would probably be limited to `` garden '' type food crop - a it ha the required expertise and `` extension '' staff , and the raw material ( waste cellulosic material and nutrient such a filter mud and molasses ) . The use of sugarcane a a biofuel seems to be successful in Brazil , but that technology is not necessarily appropriate to different socio-economic environment . Small scale charcoal producing plant , based on cane trash or bagasse , could have a major economic impact in poorer country , and would help to prevent deforestation . Again , the sugar industry ha the expertise and resource to promote such technology .

aVCoastal saltmarshes are reputed to be one of the most vulnerable community to global warming , with widespread evidence of retreat and movement of lower marsh vegetation into area previously occupied by upper marsh vegetation in response to rising sea level , and potential change in community composition from change in rainfall , temperature and wind . We undertook an investigation of decade scale change in the distribution of saltmarsh community defined by dominant specie , using historic vegetation map , remote sensing imagery and extensive field data collection . Our study area in south-eastern Tasmania ha suffered a marked increase in temperature and wind speed and a marked decrease in rainfall since 1975 , with sea level rising at a rate of 0.8 mm per annum . We therefore tested the hypothesis that these change would result in a shift in saltmarsh community composition towards more salt- and inundation-tolerant community and salt scald . Eighteen percent of the 1975 marsh wa lost to direct human modification and a net 4 % wa lost to coastal retreat . One large marsh wa cut off from the sea then burned , then reconnected with the sea . The vegetation change between 1975 and 2009 in other part of the saltmarshes occurred in 21 % of their 1975 area . Most of the community transition were consistent with increasing aridity . Thus , our result indicate that global warming ha already caused marked change in community composition in saltmarsh in Tasmania .

aVMigrations toward altered sea surface temperature ( SST ) pattern in the Indo-Pacific region are present in the recent observational record and in future global warming projection . These SSTs are in the form of `` permanent '' El Nio-like ( herein termed `` El Padre '' ) and Indian Ocean Dipole ( IOD ) -like pattern . The Early Pliocene Warm Period , which bear similarity to future warming projection , may have also exhibited these Indo-Pacific SST pattern , a suggested by regional terrestrial paleo-climatic data and general circulation model study . The ability to corroborate this assessment with paleo-data reconstruction is an advantage of the warm Pliocene period that is not afforded by future warming scenario . Thus , the Pliocene period provides u with a warm-climate perspective and test bed for understanding potential change to future atmospheric interaction given these altered SST state . This study specifically ass how atmospheric teleconnections from El Padre/IOD SST pattern are generated and propagate to create the regional climate signal of the Pliocene period , a these signal may be representative of future regional climatic change a well . To do this , we construct a holistic diagnostic rubric that allows u to examine atmospheric teleconnections , both energetically and dynamically , a produced by a general circulation model . We incorporate KE ' , a diagnostic adapted from the eddy kinetic energy generation field , to ass the available energy transferred to these teleconnections . Using this methodology , we found that relative to our Modern Control experiment , weaker atmospheric teleconnections prevail under warm Pliocene condition , although pathway of propagation still appear directed toward the southwestern United States from our tropical Pacific sector forcing . Propagation directly emanating from the Indian Ocean forcing sector appears to be largely blocked , although indirect teleconnective pathway appear traversing the Asian continent toward the North Pacific . The change in the atmospheric circulation of Indian Ocean region in response to the underlying specified SST forcing ( and indicated by Pliocene paleo-data ) may have a host of implication for energy transfer out of and into the region , including interaction with the Asian jet stream and change to the seasonal monsoon cycle . These interaction warrant further study in both past and future warm climate scenario .

aVInvasive specie are predicted to be more successful than native a temperature increase with climate change . However , few study have examined the physiological mechanism that theoretically underlie this differential success . Because correlative evidence suggests that invasiveness is related to the width of a specie ' latitudinal range , it ha been assumed but largely untested - that range width predicts breadth of habitat temperature and physiological thermotolerances . In this study , we use empirical data from a marine community a a case study to address the hypothesis that ( 1 ) geographic temperature range attribute are related to temperature tolerance , leading to greater eurythermality in invasive specie , and ( 2 ) stress protein expression is a subcellular mechanism that could contribute to difference in thermotolerance . We examined three native and six invasive specie common in the subtidal epibenthic community of California , USA . We assessed thermotolerance by exposing individual to temperature between 14 degree C and 31 degree C and determining the temperature lethal to 50 % of individual ( LT ( 50 ) ) after a 24 hour exposure . We found a strong positive relationship between the LT ( 50 ) and both maximum habitat temperature and the breadth of temperature experience across the specie ' range . In addition , of the specie in our study , invasives tended to inhabit broader habitat temperature range and higher maximum temperature . Stress protein expression may contribute to these difference : the more thermotolerant , invasive specie Diplosoma listerianum expressed higher level of a 70-kDa heat-shock protein than the le thermotolerant , native Distaplia occidentalis for which level declined sharply above the LT ( 50 ) . Our data highlight difference between native and invasive specie with respect to organismal and cellular temperature tolerance . Future study should address , across a broader phylogenetic and ecosystem scope , whether this physiological mechanism ha facilitated the current success of invasive specie and could lead to greater success of invasives than native specie a global warming continues .

aVForest area have increased in the Mediterranean basin over the last two decade , due to the abandonment of agriculture . This and the occurrence of intense drought period have led to an increase in the frequency and intensity of fire . Fire and drought can increase short-term soil organic C accumulation a a result of increased plant residue . In this study , we examined the change in the soil organic C and the effect of fire and drought during a 12-year period in two Mediterranean grassland and a shrubland . Thus , we established 6 plot for each of the three vegetation type and we set 18 experimental fire . Soils were sampled 3 day , 9 month , 6 year and 12 year after the fire and were analyzed for organic C. We used the RothC-26.3 model to help interpret the change we observed . Three day after the fire , the amount of organic C wa higher in burned plot than in unburned plot down to a depth of 5 cm . This wa true in all plant community under study and wa probably due to burned plant deposition after the fire . However , these difference disappeared in the following year . In some case , organic C from burned and unburned plot showed a large increase between year 6 and 12 , which coincided with an extended 4-year drought period . Our result indicate that in Mediterranean shrublands and mixed shrub-grasslands the influence of drought period could produce transient pulse of C that are much larger than the pulse produced by fire . The pulse of C caused by drought should be considered when studying the soil organic C dynamic in the frame of global warming .

aVSymbiodinium sp . occurs in a symbiotic association with various marine invertebrate , including the scleractinian coral . Understanding the flexibility and specificity in coral-algal symbiosis can have important implication for predicting the future of coral reef in the era of global climate change . In the present study , we conducted Symbiodinium phylotype analysis , based on polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism ( PCR-RFLP ) , in the scleractinian coral , Galaxea fascicularis , from a tropical fringing reef in Hainan Island , over a 1-yr period . Our result showed that Galaxea fascicularis could associate with Symbiodinium clade C and D either individually or simultaneously . However , during the sampling period , the Symbiodinium phylotype did not change significantly in the scleractinian coral Galaxea fascicularis , although the seawater temperature decreased sharply in the winter season . This study further suggests that the shift in Symbiodinium community in response to seasonally fluctuating environment might not be a universal feature of coral-algal association .

aVAustralia 's so-called `` Dead Heart , '' it hot arid interior landscape , can be brought into irrigated agricultural production with the importation of extracontinental freshwater supply originating in Papua New Guinea . Despite Queensland 's La Nina-caused historic and costly 2010 to 2011 river flooding induced , in great part by tropical cyclone Yasi , it westernmost torrid region is classed a arid , currently almost without any irrigation agriculture present . Freshwater importation from Papua New Guinea 's Fly River via an undersea pipeline mostly skirting the Torres Strait could increase the value of Queensland 's little-used dryland Outback and , perhaps , establish new overseas market in Asia for exported agricultural product . An induced perennial Diamantina River could replenish groundwater recharge region ( Great Artesian Basin ) and convert Lake Eyre to a permanent lake of slightly brackish water . Irrigated eucalyptus tree plantation might serve , in part , to counter some Earthly global warming . The Torres Strait Islanders will benefit economically a well a other social group on the mainland of Papua New Guinea . Here we examine closely some of the technical aspect of a Papua New Guinea-Queensland ( PNG-QLD ) Undersea Freshwater Pipeline Macroproject ( UFPM ) installation . We offer a choice of two routings for the PNG-QLD UFPM ( Case A ) while at the same time making clear our informed preference .

aVBackground : To understand how forest and woodland respond to global climate change , phenological observation are being made at a number of site worldwide . Recently , digital camera have been deployed a part of the existing network of ecosystem CO2 flux tower to provide a time-series of canopy image , and various numerical index have so far been used by different author . Aims : To identify which are the most effective colour index to calculate from the signal extracted from digital camera , in order to provide recommendation to the scientific community . Methods : Sample image of a Japanese beech ( Fagus crenata ) forest on Mt . Tsukuba ( Japan ) were used to define and calculate 12 colour signal and vegetation index . Results : Although the strength of green signal and green excess index were reliable indicator for estimating foliage growth period , the index were susceptible to low-visibility weather condition and distance from the camera . Hue provided a robust metric , showing much le scatter during the vegetative period and a good indication of spring bud break . The bud break date derived from the index were slightly earlier than those assessed by visual observation , while the abscission date were later . Conclusions : We propose that of all the candidate colour index , hue is the most promising for the detection of bud break a it wa least affected by atmospheric condition .

aVThe cause , anatomy and consequence of the early Holocene sea level rise ( EHSLR ) are reviewed . The rise , of ca 60m , took place over most of the Earth a the volume of the ocean increased during deglaciation and is dated at 11,650-7000 cal . BP . The EHSLR wa largely driven by meltwater release from decaying ice mass and the break up of coastal ice stream . The pattern of ice sheet decay and the evidence for meltwater pulse are reviewed , and it is argued that the EHSLR wa a factor in the ca 8470 BP flood from Lake Agassiz-Ojibway . Patterns of relative sea level change are examined and it is argued that in addition to regional variation , temporal change are indicated . The impact of the EHSLR on climate is reviewed and it is maintained that the event wa a factor in the 8200 BP cooling event , a well a in change in ocean current pattern and their resultant effect . The EHSLR may also have enhanced volcanic activity , but no clear evidence of a causal link with submarine sliding on continental slope and shelf can yet be demonstrated . The rise probably influenced rate and pattern of human migration and cultural change . It is concluded that the EHSLR wa a major event of global significance , knowledge of which is relevant to an understanding of the impact of global climate change in the future .

aVOwing to issue of global warming and energy security , improving engine thermal efficiency ha become increasingly important today . This paper investigates the impact of high-research-octane-number ( RON ) fuel on engine thermal efficiency . It is shown that the lean boosted engine ha higher potential to increase engine thermal efficiency than naturally aspirated ( NA ) engine and the combination of lean boosted engine and high-RON fuel give around 44 per cent engine thermal efficiency . The engine thermal efficiency exceeds a diesel engine 's thermal efficiency . Therefore , the combination is expected to be an effective way to reduce CO ( 2 ) emission in the future . In this paper , the high-RON fuel are blended with gasoline component or bio-components . This paper also describes the combustion characteristic of ethanol and butanol . These fuel have good combustion feature after the engine ha warmed up . However , it is found that butanol give more severe combustion characteristic under cold condition .

aVThis study compared the environmental impact of a range of dairy production system in term of their global warming potential ( GWP , expressed a carbon dioxide equivalent , CO ( 2 ) -eq . ) and associated land use and explored the efficacy of reducing said impact . Models were developed using the unique data generated from a long-term genetic line x feeding system experiment . Holstein-Friesian cow were selected to represent the UK average for milk fat plus protein production ( control line ) or were selected for increased milk fat plus protein production ( select line ) . In addition , cow received a low forage diet ( 50 % forage ) with no grazing or were on a high forage ( 75 % forage ) diet with summer grazing . A Markov chain approach wa used to describe the herd structure and help estimate the GWP per year and land required per cow for the 4 alternative system and the herd average using a partial life cycle assessment . The CO ( 2 ) -eq . emission were expressed per kilogram of energy-corrected milk ( ECM ) and per hectare of land use , a well a land required per kilogram of ECM . The effect of a phenotypic and genetic standard deviation unit improvement on herd feed utilization efficiency , ECM yield , calving interval length , and incidence of involuntary culling were assessed . The low forage ( nongrazing ) feeding system with select cow produced the lowest CO ( 2 ) -eq . emission of 1.1 kg/kg of ECM and land use of 0.65 m ( 2 ) /kg of ECM but the highest CO ( 2 ) -eq . emission of 16.1 t/ha of the production system studied . Within the herd , an improvement of 1 standard deviation in feed utilization efficiency wa the only trait of those studied that would significantly reduce the reliance of the farming system on bought-in synthetic fertilizer and concentrate feed , a well a reduce the average CO ( 2 ) -eq . emission and land use of the herd ( both by about 6.5 % , of which about 4 % would be achievable through selective breeding ) . Within production system , reduction in CO ( 2 ) -eq . emission per kilogram of ECM and CO2-eq . emission per hectare were also achievable by an improvement in feed utilization . This study allowed development of model that harness the biological trait variation in the animal to improve the environmental impact of the farming system . Genetic selection for efficient feed use for milk production according to feeding system can bring about reduction in system nutrient requirement , CO ( 2 ) -eq . emission , and land use per unit product .

aVTo evaluate the effect of stratospheric geoengineering with sulphate aerosol , we propose standard forcing scenario to be applied to multiple climate model to compare their result and determine the robustness of their response . Thus far , different modeling group have used different forcing scenario for both global warming and geoengineering , complicating the comparison of result . We recommend four experiment to explore the extent to which geoengineering might offset climate change projected in some of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project 5 experiment . These experiment focus on stratospheric aerosol , but future experiment under this framework may focus on different mean of geoengineering .

aVConversion of wetland by drainage for agriculture or other anthropogenic activity could have a negative or positive feedback to global warming ( GWF ) . We suggest that a major predictor of the GWF is salinity of the wetland soil ( a proxy for available sulfate ) , a factor often ignored in other study . We ass the radiative balance of two northern salt marsh with average soil salinity > 20 ppt , but with high ( macro- ) and low ( micro- ) tidal amplitude . The flux of greenhouse gas from soil at the end of the growing season averaged 485 +/- 253 mg m ( -2 ) h ( -1 ) , 13 +/- 30 mu g m ( -2 ) h ( -1 ) , and 19 +/- 58 mu g m ( -2 ) h ( -1 ) in the microtidal marsh and 398 +/- 201 mg m ( -2 ) h ( -1 ) , 2 +/- 26 mu g m ( -2 ) h ( -1 ) , and 35 +/- 77 mu g m ( -2 ) h ( -1 ) in the macrotidal marsh for CO ( 2 ) , N ( 2 ) O , and CH ( 4 ) , respectively . High rate of C sequestration mean that loss of these marsh would have a radiative balance of -981CO ( 2- ) eq . m ( -2 ) yr ( -1 ) in the microtidal and -567CO ( 2- ) eq.m ( -2 ) yr ( -1 ) in the macrotidal marsh .

aVSeveral study have been conducted on the response of crop to greater concentration of atmospheric CO ( 2 ) ( CO ( 2 ) fertilization ) a a result of climate change , but only few study have evaluated this effect on multipurpose agroforestry tree specie in tropical environment . The objective of this study were to quantify difference in growth parameter and in leaf carbon ( C ) and nitrogen ( N ) concentration of Cedrela odorata L. and Gliricidia sepium ( Jacq . ) Walp . seedling under current ambient temperature ( 32 degree C daytime , 22 degree C night time ) and CO ( 2 ) ( 360 ppm ) ( AMB ) ; CO ( 2 ) fertilization ( 800 ppm , 32 degree C daytime , 22 degree C night time ) ( ( f ) CO ( 2 ) ) ; elevated ambient temperature ( 360 ppm , 34 degree C daytime , 25 degree C night time ) ( TEMP ) ; and a combination of elevated temperature ( 32 degree C daytime , 22 degree C night time ) and CO ( 2 ) fertilization ( 800 ppm ) ( TEMPx ( f ) CO ( 2 ) ) . Results showed significant difference ( P < 0.05 ) in seedling growth parameter ( seedling height , number of stem leaf , leaf area ratio , shoot and root biomass , and shoot/root ratio ) between treatment for both tree specie . The greatest increase in growth parameter occurred in the TEMP and TEMPxfCO ( 2 ) treatment compared to the AMB treatment for both tree specie . However , growth parameter were significantly lower ( P < 0.05 ) in the fCO ( 2 ) treatment compared to that of the AMB treatment . Leaf N concentration wa 1.1 to 2.1 time lower ( P < 0.05 ) in all treatment when compared to current ambient condition ( AMB ) in both tree specie , but no significant change in leaf C concentration were observed . Results from our study suggested that fCO ( 2 ) had the greatest negative impact on tree growth parameter , and leaf N concentration were affected negatively in all treatment compared to current ambient condition . It is expected that such change in growth parameter and plant N content may impact the long-term cycling of nutrient in agroforestry system .

aVBackground : The increasing evidence for rapid global climate change ha highlighted the need for investigation examining the relationship between weather variability and infectious disease . However , the impact of weather fluctuation on hand , foot , and mouth disease ( HFMD ) , which primarily affect child , is not well understood . Methods : We acquired data related to case of HFMD and weather parameter of temperature and humidity in Fukuoka , Japan between 2000 and 2010 , and used time-series analysis to ass the possible relationship of weather variability with pediatric HFMD case , adjusting for seasonal and interannual variation . Results : Our analysis revealed that the weekly number of HFMD case increased by 11.2 % ( 95 % CI : 3.2-19.8 ) for every 1 degree C increase in average temperature and by 4.7 % ( 95 % CI : 2.4-7.2 ) for every 1 % increase in relative humidity . Notably , the effect of temperature and humidity on HFMD infection were most significant in child under the age of 10 year . Conclusions : Our study provides quantitative evidence that the number of HFMD case increased significantly with increasing average temperature and relative humidity , and suggests that preventive measure for limiting the spread of HFMD , particularly in younger child , should be considered during extended period of high temperature and humidity .

aVMarine sponge are critical component of benthic environment ; however , their sessile habit , requirement to filter large volume of water and complex symbiotic partnership make them particularly vulnerable to the effect of global climate change . We assessed the effect of elevated seawater temperature on bacterial community in larva of the Great Barrier Reef sponge , Rhopaloeides odorabile . In contrast to the strict thermal threshold of 32 degree C previously identified in adult R. odorabile , larva exhibit a markedly higher thermal tolerance , with no adverse health effect detected at temperature below 36 degree C. Similarly , larval microbial community were conserved at temperature up to 34 degree C with a highly significant shift occurring after 24 h at 36 degree C. This shift involved the loss of previously described symbionts ( in particular the Nitrospira , Chloroflexi and a Roseobacter lineage ) and the appearance of new Gammaproteobacteria not detected at lower temperature . Here , we demonstrated that sponge larva maintain highly stable symbioses at seawater temperature exceeding those that are predicted under current climate change scenario . In addition , by revealing that the shift in microbial composition occurs in conjunction with necrosis and mortality of larva at 36 degree C we have provided additional evidence of the strong link between host health and the stability of symbiont community .

aVSea floor methane vent and seeps direct methane generated by microbial and thermal decomposition of organic matter in sediment into the ocean and atmosphere . Methane vent contribute to ocean acidification , global warming , and providing a long-term ( e.g . 500-4000 year ; Powell et al. , 1998 ) life-sustaining role for unique chemosynthetic biological community . However , the role methane vent play in both climate change and chemosynthetic life remains controversial primarily because we do not understand long-term methane flux and the mechanism that control it ( Milkov et al. , 2004 ; Shakhova et al. , 2010 ; Van Dover , 2000 ) . Vents are inherently dynamic and flux varies greatly in magnitude and even flow direction over short time period ( hours-to-days ) , often tidally-driven ( Boles et al. , 2001 ; Tryon et al. , 1999 ) . But , it remains unclear if flux change at vent occur on the order of the life-cycle of various specie within chemosynthetic community ( month , year , to decade Leifer et al. , 2004 ; Torres et al. , 2001 ) and thus impact their sustainability . Here , using repeat high-resolution 3D seismic survey acquired in 2000 and 2008 , we demonstrate in 40 that Hydrate Ridge , a vent off the Oregon coast ha undergone significant reduction of methane flow and complete interruption in just the past few year . In the subsurface , below a frozen methane hydrate layer , free gas appears to be migrating toward the vent , but currently there is accumulating gas that is unable to reach the seafloor through the gas hydrate layer . At the same time , abundant authigenic carbonate show that the system ha been active for several thousand of year . Thus , it is likely that activity ha been intermittent because gas hydrate clog the vertical flow pathway feeding the seafloor vent . Back pressure building in the subsurface will ultimately trigger hydrofracturing that will revive fluid-flow to the seafloor . The nature of this mechanism implies regular recurring flow interruption and methane flux change that threaten the viability of chemosynthetic life , but simultaneously and enigmatically sustains it .

aVCloud feedback represents the source of largest diversity in projection of future warming . Observational constraint on both the sign and magnitude of the feedback are limited , since it is unclear how the natural variability that can be observed is related to secular climate change , and analysis have rarely been focused on testable physical theory for how cloud should respond to climate change . In this study we use observation from a suite of satellite instrument to ass the sensitivity of tropical high cloud to interannual tropical mean surface temperature anomaly . We relate cloud change to a physical governing mechanism that is sensitive to the vertical structure of warming . Specifically , we demonstrate that the mean and interannual variability in both the altitude and fractional coverage of tropical high cloud a measured by CloudSat , the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer , the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder , and the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project are well diagnosed by upper tropospheric convergence computed from the mass and energy budget of the clear-sky atmosphere . Observed high cloud rise approximately isothermally in accordance with theory and exhibit an overall reduction in coverage when the tropic warms , similar to their behavior in global warming simulation . Such cloud change cause absorbed solar radiation to increase more than doe outgoing longwave radiation , resulting in a positive but statistically insignificant net high cloud feedback in response to El Nino-Southern Oscillation . The result suggest that the convergence metric based on simple mass and energy budget constraint may be a powerful tool for understanding observed and modeled high cloud behavior and for evaluating the realism of modeled high cloud change in response to a variety of forcings .

aVPrevious work ha demonstrated that observed and modeled climate show a near-time-invariant ratio of mean land to mean ocean surface temperature change under transient and equilibrium global warming . This study confirms this in a range of atmospheric model coupled to perturbed sea surface temperature ( SSTs ) , slab ( thermodynamics only ) ocean , and a fully coupled ocean . Away from equilibrium , it is found that the atmospheric process that maintain the ratio cause a land-to-ocean heat transport anomaly that can be approximated using a two-box energy balance model . When climate is forced by increasing atmospheric CO ( 2 ) concentration , the heat transport anomaly move heat from land to ocean , constraining the land to warm in step with the ocean surface , despite the small heat capacity of the land . The heat transport anomaly is strongly related to the top-of-atmosphere radiative flux imbalance , and hence it tends to a small value a equilibrium is approached . In contrast , when climate is forced by prescribing change in SSTs , the heat transport anomaly replaces `` missing '' radiative forcing over land by moving heat from ocean to land , warming the land surface . The heat transport anomaly remains substantial in steady state . These result are consistent with earlier study that found that both land and ocean surface temperature change may be approximated a local response to global mean radiative forcing . The modeled heat transport anomaly ha large impact on surface heat flux but small impact on precipitation , circulation , and cloud radiative forcing compared with the impact of surface temperature change . No substantial nonlinearities are found in these atmospheric variable when the effect of forcing and surface temperature change are added .

aVIn this study the potential future change in different aspect of the Indian summer monsoon associated with a global warming of 2A degree C with respect to pre-industrial time are assessed , focussing on the role of the different mechanism leading to these change . In addition , these change a well a the underlying mechanism are compared to the corresponding change associated with a markedly stronger global warming exceeding 4.5A degree C , associated with the widely used SRES A1B scenario . The study is based on two set of four ensemble simulation with the ECHAM5/MPI-OM coupled climate model , each starting from different initial condition . In one set of simulation ( 2020-2200 ) , greenhouse gas concentration and sulphate aerosol load have been prescribed in such a way that the simulated global warming dioes not exceed 2A degree C with respect to pre-industrial time . In the other set of simulation ( 1860-2200 ) , greenhouse gas concentration and sulphate aerosol load have been prescribed according to observation until 2000 and according to the SRES A1B scenario after 2000 . The study reveals marked change in the Indian summer monsoon associated with a global warming of 2A degree C with respect to pre-industrial condition , namely an intensification of the summer monsoon precipitation despite a weakening of the large-scale monsoon circulation . The increase in the monsoon rainfall is related to a variety of different mechanism , with the intensification of the atmospheric moisture transport into the Indian region a the most important one . The weakening of the large-scale monsoon circulation is mainly caused by change in the Walker circulation with large-scale divergence ( convergence ) in the lower ( uppper ) troposphere over the Indian Ocean in response to enhanced convective activity over the Indian Ocean and the central and eastern Pacific and reduced convective activity over the western tropical Pacific . These change in the Walker circulation induce westerly ( easterly ) wind anomaly at lower ( upper ) level in the Indian region . The comparison with the change in the Indian summer monsoon associated with a global warming of 4.5A degree C reveals that both the intensification of the monsoon precipitation and the weakening of the large-scale monsoon circulation ( particularly in the lower troposphere ) are relatively strong ( with respect to the magnitude of the projected global warming by the end of the twentieth century for the two scenario ) in the scenario with a global warming of 2A degree C. The relatively strong intensification of the monsoon rainfall is related to rather strong increase in evaporation over the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal , while a rather weak amplification of the meridional temperature gradient between the Indian Ocean and the land area to the north contributes to the relatively strong reduction of the large-scale monsoon flow .

aVThe temporal and spatial characteristic of trend in extreme index over Korea between 1971 and 2100 are investigated using daily minimum ( Tmin ) and maximum ( Tmax ) temperature and precipitation data from a regional climate projection at 20 km grid spacing . Five temperature-based index and five precipitation-based index are selected to comprehensively consider the frequency , intensity , and persistence of extreme event . In addition , Mann-Kendall test are used to detect the statistical significance of trend in these index . For validation during the reference period ( 1971-2000 ) , the model reasonably simulates the temporal and spatial pattern of the trend . The model capture observed direction and magnitude well in various type of extreme . Indices based on Tmin show a considerable change towards warmer climate condition while index based on Tmax do not reveal any distinct trend , implying an asymmetric response of Tmin and Tmax to global warming . Indices of the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation show a significant increase , whereas the duration of dry and wet consecutive day show no change . For future projection , the temperature-based index exhibit a much more significant and consistent trend than the precipitation-based index , with statistical significance at the 95 % confidence level for all index . The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation are projected to increase in the 21st century , continuing the trend of the reference climate . Although the future projected change in the duration of consecutive dry and wet day are not statistically significant , the signal becomes more pronounced with respect to the reference simulation .

aVCold temperature are thought to be among the most important determining factor of geographic distribution for tropical and sub-tropical marine invertebrate . The Asian green mussel , Perna viridis , ha been introduced into coastal water of Florida where it current distribution is hypothesized to be limited by low temperature during winter . Lethal and sub-lethal effect ( heat shock protein/Hsp70 expression ) of cold water and air temperature were analyzed in two size class of P. viridis from Florida in an effort to determine the effect of current and forecasted temperature on the potential for range expansion . Mussels were exposed to water temperature of 14 , 10 , 7 and 3 degree C for up to 30 day , or to air temperature of 14 , 7 , 0 and -10 degree C for period of 2 hr . Mortality wa significantly increased at all water and air temperaturesr < = 14 degree C. No difference in mortality rate were observed between small ( 15-45 mm ) and large ( 75-105 mm ) size class except after exposure to 7 degree C air , in which small mussel had higher mortality . Significant increase in Hsp70 expression were observed after a 2-hour exposure to 10 degree C water , but Hsp70 expression wa not significantly increased at any temperature in which mortality wa not also significant . The temperature threshold for survival in this population appears to be between 10 and 14 degree C , suggesting that under current condition P. viridis may already be at the northern edge of it potential range in the United States . If water temperature increase with global climate change , northerly flowing current may permit range expansion a temperature allow . J. Exp . Zool . 315 : 12-21 , 2011 .

aVGenetic adaptation to temperature change can impact response of population and community to global warming . Here we integrate previously published result on experimental evolution trial with follow-up experiment involving the water flea Daphnia a a model system . Our research show ( 1 ) the capacity of natural population of this specie to genetically adapt to change in temperature in a time span of month to year , ( 2 ) the context-dependence of these genetic change , emphasizing the role of ecology and community composition on evolutionary response to climatic change , and ( 3 ) the impact of micro-evolutionary change on immigration success of preadapted genotype . Our study involves ( 1 ) experimental evolution trial in the absence and presence of the community of competitor , predator , and parasite , ( 2 ) life-table and competition experiment to ass the fitness consequence of micro-evolution , and ( 3 ) competition experiment with putative immigrant genotype . We use these observation a building block of an evolving metacommunity to understand biological response to climatic change . This approach integrates both local and regional response at both the population and community level . Finally , we provide an outline of current gap in knowledge and suggest fruitful avenue for future research .

aVThermal performance curve ( TPCs ) describe the effect of temperature on biological rate process . Here , we use example from our work on common killifish ( Fundulus heteroclitus ) to illustrate some important conceptual issue relating to TPCs in the context of using these curve to predict the response of organism to climate change . Phenotypic plasticity ha the capacity to alter the shape and position of the TPCs for acute exposure , but these change can be obscured when rate process are measured only following chronic exposure . For example , the acute TPC for mitochondrial respiration in killifish is exponential in shape , but this shape change with acclimation . If respiration rate is measured only at the acclimation temperature , the TPC is linear , concealing the underlying mechanistic complexity at an acute time scale . These issue are particularly problematic when attempting to use TPCs to predict the response of organism to temperature change in natural environment . Many TPCs are generated using laboratory exposure to constant temperature , but temperature fluctuates in the natural environment , and the mechanism influencing performance at acute and chronic time scale , and the response of the performance trait at these time scale may be quite different . Unfortunately , our current understanding of the mechanism underlying the response of organism to temperature change is incomplete , particularly with respect to integrating from process occurring at the level of single protein up to whole-organism function across different time scale , which is a challenge for the development of strongly grounded mechanistic model of response to global climate change .

aVLimiting global warming to 2 degree C above pre-industrial global mean temperature ha become a widely endorsed goal for climate policy . It ha also been severely criticized . We show how the limit emerged out of a marginal remark in an early paper about climate policy and distinguish three possible view of it . The catastrophe view see it a the threshold separating a domain of safety from a domain of catastrophe . The cost-benefit view see it a a strategy to optimize the relation between the cost and benefit of climate policy . The focal point view see it a a solution to a complex coordination problem . We argue that the focal point view is the most appropriate . It lead to an emphasis on implementing effective step toward a near-zero emission economy , without panicking in the face of a possible temporary overshooting . After several decade of practical experience , the focal point may or may not be redefined on the basis of knowledge gathered thanks to these experience .

aVClimate change is one of the main factor that will affect biodiversity in the future and may even cause specie extinction . We suggest a methodology to derive a general relationship between biodiversity change and global warming . In conjunction with other pressure relationship , our relationship can help to ass the combined effect of different pressure to overall biodiversity change and indicate area that are most at risk . We use a combination of an integrated environmental model ( IMAGE ) and climate envelope model for European plant specie for several climate change scenario to estimate change in mean stable area of specie and specie turnover . We show that if global temperature increase , then both specie turnover will increase , and mean stable area of specie will decrease in all biome . The most dramatic change will occur in Northern Europe , where more than 35 % of the specie composition in 2100 will be new for that region , and in Southern Europe , where up to 25 % of the specie now present will have disappeared under the climatic circumstance forecasted for 2100 . In Mediterranean scrubland and natural grassland/steppe system , arctic and tundra system specie turnover is high , indicating major change in specie composition in these ecosystem . The mean stable area of specie decrease mostly in Mediterranean scrubland , grassland/steppe system and warm mixed forest .

aVCarbon dioxide ( CO2 ) is the most important man-made greenhouse gas ( GHG ) that cause global warming . With electricity generation through fossil-fuel power plant now being the economic sector with the largest source of CO2 , power plant emission monitoring ha become more important than ever in the fight against global warming . In a previous study done by Bovensmann et al . ( 2010 ) , random and systematic error of power plant CO2 emission have been quantified using a single overpass from a proposed CarbonSat instrument . In this study , we quantify error of power plant annual emission estimate from a hypothetical CarbonSat and constellation of several CarbonSats while taking into account that power plant CO2 emission are time-dependent . Our focus is on estimating systematic error arising from the sparse temporal sampling a well a random error that are primarily dependent on wind speed . We used hourly emission data from the US Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) combined with assimilated and re-analyzed meteorological field from the National Centers of Environmental Prediction ( NCEP ) . CarbonSat orbit were simulated a a sun-synchronous low-earth orbiting satellite ( LEO ) with an 828-km orbit height , local time ascending node ( LTAN ) of 13:30 ( 01:30 p.m. LT ) and achieves global coverage after 5 day . We show , that despite the variability of the power plant emission and the limited satellite overpass , one CarbonSat ha the potential to verify reported US annual CO2 emission from large power plant ( > = 5 MtCO ( 2 ) yr ( -1 ) ) with a systematic error of le than similar to 4.9 % and a random error of le than similar to 6.7 % for 50 % of all the power plant . For 90 % of all the power plant , the systematic error wa le than similar to 12.4 % and the random error wa le than similar to 13 % . We additionally investigated two different satellite configuration using a combination of 5 CarbonSats . One achieves global coverage everyday but only sample the target at fixed local time . The other configuration sample the target five time at two-hour interval approximately every 6th day but only achieves global coverage after 5 day . From the statistical analysis , we found , a expected , that the random error improve by approximately a factor of two if 5 satellite are used . On the other hand , more satellite do not result in a large reduction of the systematic error . The systematic error is somewhat smaller for the CarbonSat constellation configuration achieving global coverage everyday . Therefore , we recommend the CarbonSat constellation configuration that achieves daily global coverage .

aVAim We examined the phylogeography of the cold-temperate macroalgal specie Fucus distichus L. , a key foundation specie in rocky intertidal shore and the only Fucus specie to occur naturally in both the North Pacific and the North Atlantic . Location North Pacific and North Atlantic ocean ( 42 degree to 77 degree N ) . Methods We genotyped individual from 23 population for a mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) intergenic spacer ( IGS ) ( n = 608 ) and the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I ( COI ) region ( n = 276 ) , a well a for six nuclear microsatellite locus ( n = 592 ) . Phylogeographic structure and connectivity were assessed using population genetic and phylogenetic network analysis . Results IGS mtDNA haplotype diversity wa highest in the North Pacific , and divergence between Pacific haplotype wa much older than that of the single cluster of Atlantic haplotype . Two ancestral Pacific IGS/COI cluster led to a widespread Atlantic cluster . High mtDNA and microsatellite diversity were observed in Prince William Sound , Alaska , 11 year after severe disturbance by the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill . Main conclusion At least two colonization occurred from the older North Pacific population to the North Atlantic between the opening of the Bering Strait and the onset of the Last Glacial Maximum . One colonization event wa from the Japanese Archipelago/eastern Aleutians , and a second wa from the Alaskan mainland around the Gulf of Alaska . Japanese population probably arose from a single recolonization event from the eastern Aleutian Islands before the North Pacific-North Atlantic colonization . In the North Atlantic , the Last Glacial Maximum forced the specie into at least two known glacial refugia : the Nova Scotia/Newfoundland ( Canada ) region and And circle divide ya ( northern Norway ) . The presence of two private haplotype in the central Atlantic suggests the possibility of colonization from other refugia that are now too warm to support F. distichus . With the continuing decline in Arctic ice cover a a result of global climate change , renewed contact between North Pacific and North Atlantic population of Fucus specie is expected .

aVLarge-scale transcription profiling via direct cDNA sequencing provides important insight a to how foundation specie cope with increasing climatic extreme predicted under global warming . Species distributed along a thermal cline , such a the ecologically important seagrass Zostera marina , provide an opportunity to ass temperature effect on gene expression a a function of their long-term adaptation to heat stress . We exposed a southern and northern European population of Zostera marina from contrasting thermal environment to a realistic heat wave in a common-stress garden . In a fully crossed experiment , eight cDNA library , each comprising similar to 125 000 read , were obtained during and after a simulated heat wave , along with nonstressed control treatment . Although gene-expression pattern during stress were similar in both population and were dominated by classical heat-shock protein , transcription profile diverged after the heat wave . Gene-expression pattern in southern genotype returned to control value immediately , but genotype from the northern site failed to recover and revealed the induction of gene involved in protein degradation , indicating failed metabolic compensation to high sea-surface temperature . We conclude that the return of gene-expression pattern during recovery provides critical information on thermal adaptation in aquatic habitat under climatic stress . As a unifying concept for ecological genomics , we propose transcriptomic resilience , analogous to ecological resilience , a an important measure to predict the tolerance of individual and hence the fate of local population in the face of global warming .

aVChanges in soil carbon , the largest terrestrial carbon pool , are critical for the global carbon cycle , atmospheric CO ( 2 ) level and climate . Climate warming is predicted to be most pronounced in the northern region and therefore the large soil carbon pool residing in boreal forest will be subject to larger global warming impact than soil carbon pool in the temperate or the tropical forest . A major uncertainty in current estimate of the terrestrial carbon balance is related to decomposition of soil organic matter ( SOM ) . We hypothesized that when soil are exposed to warmer climate the structure of the ground vegetation will change much more rapidly than the dominant tree specie . This change will alter the quality and amount of litter input to the soil and induce change in microbial community , thus possibly altering the temperature sensitivity of SOM decomposition . We transferred organic surface soil section from the northern border of the boreal forest zone to corresponding forest site in the southern border of the boreal forest zone and studied the effect of warmer climate after an adaptation period of 2 year . The result showed that initially ground vegetation and soil microbial community structure and community function were different in northern and southern forest site and that 2 year of exposure to warmer climate wa long enough to cause change in these ecological indicator . The rate of SOM decomposition wa approximately equally sensitive to temperature irrespective of change in vegetation or microbial community in the studied forest site . However , a temperature sensitivity of the decomposition increase with decreasing temperature regime , the proportional increase in the decomposition rate in northern latitude could lead to significant carbon loss from the soil .

aVThe present study is the first attempt to develop an annual ( August-July ) precipitation series back to AD 1330 using a tree ring data network of Himalayan cedar ( Cedrus deodara ( Roxb . ) G. Don ) from the Lahaul-Spiti region in the western Himalaya , India . The rainfall reconstruction reveals high magnitude multidecadal drought during the 14th and 15th century and thenceforth a gradual increase in precipitation . Increasingly wet condition during the 20th century are consistent with other long-term precipitation reconstruction from high Asia and reflect a large-scale intensification of the hydrological cycle , coincident with what is anticipated due to global warming . Significant relationship between reconstructed precipitation and precipitation record from central southwest Asia , east of the Caspian Sea , ENSO ( NINO4-SST ) variability and summer monsoon rainfall over central northeast India underscore the utility of our data in synoptic climatology .

aVSemantic difference s have led to a gap in the understanding of the impact of climate change on precipitation frequency estimate . There is popular perception that heavy rainfall have become more frequent , and that this trend will increase with global warming . Most of the literature examines this question from the point of view of climatology using definition of `` heavy , '' `` very heavy , '' or `` extreme '' rainfall , which are different from those commonly used by civil engineer . This article identifies the difference in meaning used by the climate and civil engineering community and examines trend in the observed record in the frequency of exceedance ( not trend in magnitude ) . Using concept recognized a the basis for design of the Nation 's civil infrastructure , we look at trend in the number of exceedance of threshold for a variety of precipitation frequency and event duration used by civil engineer . We found that the estimated trend in exceedance at one-day and multiday duration were statistically significant and increasing for the Ohio River Basin and surrounding state but the reverse wa true for the Semiarid Southwest ( i.e. , not significant and decreasing trend ) . In addition , we found the magnitude of the trend wa small for all but the more frequent event and also small with respect to the uncertainty associated with the precipitation frequency estimate themselves .

aVThe number and type of late Quaternary record of tropical cyclone ( TCs ) and temperate storm have been increasing globally over the past 10 year . There are now numerous such record for the Atlantic Ocean ( USA ) and Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea , South Pacific Ocean , and a fewer number from the northwest Pacific and Indian Ocean region . The most obvious characteristic of these record is that many reveal extended alternating period of greater and lesser TC activity over the past 6000 year . The length of these phase of relative inactivity and greater activity depends on the chronological resolution of the record , with the coarser-resolution one displaying multi-century to millennial-scale episode and the high-resolution record displaying decadal to centennial-scale oscillation . In several instance the likely cause of these alternating period of TC behaviour have been attributed to different phase of climate when El Ninos and La Ninas dominated or to longer-term variation in sea surface temperature and possibly solar forcing . The picture emerging from these record is that TC behaviour is not entirely stochastic over the long term and that any simulation of long-term TC behaviour need to account for these climatic influence . Incorporation of these observation , and the many more needed , is important for understanding the future behaviour of TCs . Copyright ( C ) 2011 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd .

aVThe Mekong River Basin is a key regional resource in Southeast Asia for sector that include agriculture , fishery and electricity production . Here we explore the potential impact of climate change on freshwater resource within the river basin . We quantify uncertainty in these projection associated with GCM structure and climate sensitivity , a well a from hydrological model parameter specification . This is achieved by running pattern-scaled GCM scenario through a semi-distributed hydrological model ( SLURP ) of the basin . Pattern-scaling allows investigation of specific threshold of global climate change including the postulated 2 degree C threshold of `` dangerous '' climate change . Impacts of a 2 degree C rise in global mean temperature are investigated using seven different GCMs , providing an implicit analysis of uncertainty associated with GCM structure . Analysis of progressive change in global mean temperature from 0.5 to 6 degree C above the 1961-1990 baseline ( using the HadCM3 GCM ) reveals a relatively small but non-linear response of annual river discharge to increasing global mean temperature , ranging from a 5.4 % decrease to 4.5 % increase . Changes in mean monthly river discharge are greater ( from -16 % to +55 % , with greatest decrease in July and August , greatest increase in May and June ) and result from complex and contrasting intra-basin change in precipitation , evaporation and snow storage/melt . Whilst overall result are highly GCM dependent ( in both direction and magnitude ) , this uncertainty is primarily driven by difference in GCM projection of future precipitation . In contrast , there is strong consistency between GCMs in term of both increased potential evapotranspiration and a shift to an earlier and le substantial snowmelt season . Indeed , in the upper Mekong ( Lancang sub-basin ) , the temperature-related signal in discharge is strong enough to overwhelm the precipitation-related uncertainty in the direction of change in discharge , with scenario from all GCMs leading to increased river flow from April-June and decreased flow from July-August .

aVClimate change represents the largest social dilemma human have ever faced , where individual actor maximise their personal gain by emitting greenhouse gas into the atmosphere even though this is detrimental to the collective global good . Cooperation on a global scale is urgently required if we are to overcome this problem . However , this is difficult to achieve because cooperator pay the cost of reducing emission while any benefit are shared between cooperator and free-riders alike . In a risk-free , rational world cooperative behaviour can be promoted through mechanism that increase the benefit of cooperating relative to free-riding , such a reward or sanction . In reality , however , outcome are seldom certain and human rarely behave rationally when confronted with risky prospect . Here , we argue that effective policy to mitigate global climate change should incorporate mechanism to foster cooperation , but also account for both uncertainty and irrational response that may inhibit collective action .

aVCoastal urban flooding is increasing , affecting mainly to new urban settlement but also to the traditional one . This is due either to sea level and continental climatic factor . But also because population ha increased at the same time being coastal area selectively affected in old and new settlement , leading to need on flood resilience improvement The planet ha been suffering a global warming change leading to sea level rise that is happening since the Little Ice Age although rising since 19th century . It come with other synergic change in marine and littoral dynamic , like El Nino South sedation and cyclonic storm . But other relative sea level movement are interfering in each segment of the coast with a local or even a regional character , being the main problem to discern the factor affecting these vertical movement This paper affront the problem of the coastal urban flood , analyzing their increasing and variability , discussing the rebound and the subsidence , discerning them from the global change in the long term , and the influence of other sea level change in the `` short term '' : meteorological phenomenon ( storm surge and set-up ) , wave set-up and other long wave , in order to allow a more accurate Flood Resilience measure .

aVClimate change will likely exacerbate already existing urban social inequity and health risk , thereby exacerbating existing urban health inequity . Cities in low- and middle-income country are particularly vulnerable . Urbanization is both a cause of and potential solution to global climate change . Most population growth in the foreseeable future will occur in urban area primarily in developing country . How this growth is managed ha enormous implication for climate change given the increasing concentration and magnitude of economic production in urban locality , a well a the higher consumption practice of urbanites , especially the middle class , compared to rural population . There is still much to learn about the extent to which climate change affect urban health equity and what can be done effectively in different socio-political and socio-economic context to improve the health of urban dwelling human and the environment . But it is clear that equity-oriented climate change adaptation mean attention to the social condition in which urban population live-this is not just a climate change policy issue , it requires inter-sectoral action . Policies and program in urban planning and design , workplace health and safety , and urban agriculture can help mitigate further climate change and adapt to existing climate change . If done well , these will also be good for urban health equity .

aVNitrogen ( N ) and phosphorus ( P ) and N : P ratio in terrestrial plant and the pattern at a large geographical scale are an important issue in ecological stoichiometry . In particular , it is essential to know that for a single specie , how the N : P stoichiometry varies with climatic factor in the context of global warming . Our analysis wa based on a data set including 2583 observation at 441 site on nutritional status of Norway spruce ( Picea abies L ) located in European county ( including Austria , Belgium , Bulgaria , Czech Rep. , Finland , Germany , Ireland , Italy , Lithuania , Norway , Slovak Rep. , Slovenia , United Kingdom ) . Our objective are to demonstrate how leaf N and P concentration and N : P ratio in Norway spruce vary with altitude ( ALT ) , latitude ( LAT ) , longitude ( LON ) , mean annual temperature ( MAT ) and mean annual precipitation ( MAP ) across Europe . The result showed that for 1-year-old needle of Norway spruce , the N and P concentration were 13.28 mg g ( -1 ) , 1.41 mg g ( -1 ) and the N : P ratio wa 9.76 . Leaf N displayed a convex curve pattern with increasing MAT and decreasing LAT from the boreal Europe to the Mediterranean area . The N concentration and N : P generally reached peak at about 7 degree C in MAT or 53 degree N in LAT . The N : P ratio varied non-linearly with LAT and MAP , but linearly with MAT . Leaf N concentration and N : P ratio decreased linearly with increasing ALT in temperate European area . Across Europe , that the pattern of leaf N and N : P ratio were mainly driven by climate-related geochemistry and plant physiology , but also greatly impacted by anthropogenic N deposition .

aVIn this analysis , an atypical northward shift in the distribution of age-1 ocean shrimp ( Pandalus jordani ) recruit off Oregon in 2000 and 2002-2004 wa linked to anomolously strong coastal upwelling wind off southern Oregon ( 42 degree N latitude ) in April-July of the year of larval release ( t-1 ) . This is the first clear evidence that strong upwelling wind can depress local recruitment of ocean shrimp . Regression analysis confirmed a long-term negative correlation between log ( e ) of ocean shrimp recruitment and April sea level height ( SLH ) at Crescent City , California , in the year of larval release , for both northern and southern Oregon water . The regional pattern of ocean shrimp catch and seasonal upwelling wind showed that , although the timing of the spring transition a reflected in April SLH drive ocean shrimp recruitment success off Oregon generally , the strength and consistency of spring upwelling limit the distribution of large concentration of ocean shrimp at the southern end of the northern California/Oregon/Washington area . A northward shift in 1999 and 2001-03 in the northern edge of this 'zone of maximum upwelling ' is the likely cause of the weak southern Oregon recruitment and resulting atypical distribution of ocean shrimp observed off Oregon in 2000 and 2002-04 , with a return to a more typical catch distribution a spring upwelling moderated in subsequent year . It is noted that a northward shift in the condition that produce strong and steady spring upwelling wind is consistent with many prediction of global climate model under condition of global warming .

aVNew Zealand ( NZ ) historically ha been free of arboviral activity with the exception of Whataroa virus ( Togaviridae : Alphavirus ) , which is established in bird population and is transmitted by local mosquito . This naive situation is threatened by global warming , invasive mosquito , and tourism . To determine the threat of selected medically important arbovirus to NZ , vector competence assay were conducted using field collected endemic and introduced mosquito specie . Four alphavirus ( Togaviridae ) : Barmah Forest virus , Chikungunya virus , Ross River virus , and Sindbis virus , and five flavivirus ( Flaviviridae ) : Dengue virus 2 , Japanese encephalitis virus , Murray Valley encephalitis virus , West Nile virus , and Yellow fever virus were evaluated . Results indicate some NZ mosquito specie are highly competent vector of selected arbovirus , particularly alphavirus , and may pose a threat were one of these arbovirus introduced at a time when the vector wa prevalent and the climatic condition favorable for virus transmission .

aVIt ha been well documented that vegetation play an important role in the climate system . However , vegetation is typically kept constant when climate model are used to project anthropogenic climate change under a range of emission scenario in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) Special Report on Emission Scenarios . Here , an atmospheric general circulation model , and an asynchronously coupled system of an atmospheric and an equilibrium terrestrial biosphere model are forced by monthly sea surface temperature and sea ice extent for the period 2051-2060 and 2090-2098 a projected with 17 atmosphere-ocean general circulation model participating in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report , and by appropriate atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration under the A2 emission scenario . The effect of vegetation feedback under future global warming are then investigated . It is found that the simulated composition and distribution of vegetation during 2051-2060 ( 2090-2098 ) differ greatly from the present , and global vegetation tends to become denser a expressed by a 21 % ( 36 % ) increase in global mean leaf area index , which is most pronounced at the middle and high northern latitude . Vegetation feedback ha little effect on globally averaged surface temperature . On a regional scale , however , it induces statistically significant change in surface temperature , in particular over most part of continental Eurasia east of about 60A degree E where annual surface temperature is expected to increase by 0.1-1.0 K , with an average of about 0.4 K for each future period . These change can mostly be explained by change in surface albedo resulting from vegetation change in the context of future global warming .

aVAgricultural land in the western part of Romania , affected by successive drought and excessive moisture combination of rainfall and high water groundwater in the context of current global climate change , show a trend of desertification , manifested by an increased frequency and period of drought . The main method of fighting desertification is by using irrigation , and in the sub-west area , provided with drainage system , we have to analyse the possibility of using these system for giving water from irrigation to the plant , or the study of reversibility in the drainage - sub-irrigation . The objective of this work is to check the result obtained in horizontal dimension of the drain on heavy soil with high clay content , affected by mixed excess moisture , using DrainVSubIR program for determining the distance between drain , compared to the result of the research conducted in the drainage field Avram Iancu , the Bihor county and checking drainage reversibility between drainage and sub-irrigation for variant studied . In this experimental field , on a cambic gleical phaeziom 3 distance between the drain were observed between 1984-1990 , on distance between 15 , 30 and 45 m , with a tube made out of PVC , with 6.5 cm in diameter , with a filter in the ground , and 10 and 20 cm in height . In order to confirm the result from the research field , the distance between drain channel , for the condition given by the soil type , by using the DrainVSubIR made out 3 module , the first one calculated using the Ernst-David relation , the second one for verifying the possibility of using the sub-irrigation drainage , and the third one for the technical and economical calculation of a hectare of equipped land . The conclusion verify that the result from the field regarding the drainage variant , with the distance between the drain of 30 m and possibility of using sub-irrigation on some variant of drainage , in the condition on supplementary set up on drainage channel .

aVGlobal climate change affect ecosystem via several trophic level . We investigated change in the timing of breeding in the willow tit ( Poecile montanus ) and timing of it caterpillar food resource in relation to warming spring in a boreal forest . We used generalized linear mixed effect model to study the importance of synchrony between the timing of breeding in willow tit and the caterpillar food availability on the breeding success , measured a nestling survival rate and mean nestling weight . Both the timing of breeding and the timing of the caterpillar peak advanced during the last decade , and were well explained by spring temperature . Unlike in most passerine population studied , synchrony ha improved with rising spring temperature . However , it had only a modest although statistically significant positive influence on breeding success . Spring temperature do not seem to be used a cue for the timing of caterpillar food availability by willow tit . We conclude that response to climatic warming seem to be population , specie and habitat specific , necessitating research in a wide range of taxon in different climatic zone .

aVThe East Mediterranean deep thermohaline cell is a series of process that refer to the water sinking during winter at specific location and the subsequent spreading that fill the deep near-bottom layer of the East Mediterranean with oxygen-rich water mass . These water tend to preserve the hydrologic characteristic ( temperature , salinity , and transparency ) of their formation region . Hydrographic section offshore from Cape Passero ( west Ionian Sea ) and near the southwest tip of Peloponnisos ( east Ionian Sea ) , in the framework of the deep-neutrino-telescope-related KM3net program , cut through a bottom plume of Adriatic water at similar to 3500 m in the southwest Ionian and a deep vein at similar to 3200 m of Cretan water in the southeast Ionian . In the period 2006-2009 , the Adriatic plume , originally characterized by a strong signal of locally higher salinity and oxygen and lower transparency in the near-bottom 500 m , tends to weaken and shrink within the near-bottom similar to 200 m in 2009 . This weakening trend may be associated with the relatively warm/mild winter following 2006 . It may be typical inter-annual variability or a signature of global warming in which case an expected prolonged continuation can potentially affect the deep oxygen supply . ( c ) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

aVWhile the party to the UNFCCC agreed in the December 2009 Copenhagen Accord that a 2 degree C global warming over pre-industrial level should be avoided , current commitment on greenhouse gas emission reduction from these same party will lead to a 50 : 50 chance of warming greater than 3.5 degree C. Here , we evaluate the difference in impact and adaptation issue for water resource in world corresponding to the policy objective ( +2 degree C ) and possible reality ( +4 degree C ) . We simulate the difference in impact on surface run-off and water resource availability using a global hydrological model driven by ensemble of climate model with global temperature increase of 2 degree C and 4 degree C. We combine these with UN-based population growth scenario to explore the relative importance of population change and climate change for water availability . We find that the projected change in global surface run-off from the ensemble show an increase in spatial coherence and magnitude for a +4 degree C world compared with a +2 degree C one . In a +2 degree C world , population growth in most large river basin tends to override climate change a a driver of water stress , while in a +4 degree C world , climate change becomes more dominant , even compensating for population effect where climate change increase runoff . However , in some basin where climate change ha positive effect , the seasonality of surface run-off becomes increasingly amplified in a +4 degree C climate .

aVThe environmental profile of hydrogen depends greatly on the nature of the feedstock and the production process . In this Well-to-Wheels ( WTW ) study , the environmental impact of hydrogen production from lignocellulosic biomass via pyrolysis and subsequent steam reforming of bio-oil were evaluated and compared to the conventional production of hydrogen from natural gas steam reforming . Hydrogen wa assumed to be used a transportation fuel in an internal combustion engine vehicle . Two scenario for the provision of lignocellulosic biomass were considered : wood waste and dedicated willow cultivation . The WTW analysis showed that the production of bio-hydrogen consumes le fossil energy in the total lifecycle , mainly due to the renewable nature of the fuel that result in zero energy consumption in the combustion step . The total ( fossil and renewable ) energy demand is however higher compared to fossil hydrogen , due to the higher process energy demand and methanol used to stabilize bio-oil . Improvements could occur if these are sourced from renewable energy source . The overall benefit of using a CO ( 2 ) neutral renewable feedstock for the production of hydrogen is unquestionable . In term of global warming , production of hydrogen from biomass through pyrolysis and reforming result in major GHG emission , ranging from 40 % to 50 % , depending on the biomass source . The use of cultivated biomass aggravates the GHG emission balance , mainly due to the N ( 2 ) O emission at the cultivation step . Copyright ( C ) 2011 , Hydrogen Energy Publications , LLC .

aVIn research to date , projected climate change ha been considered to be beneficial for agriculture under Nordic condition , where crop production is mainly limited by low temperature resulting in short growing season . However , with the rapid increase in global mean temperature implied at the high end of the uncertainty range of current projection , which are typically amplified at high latitude , condition for crop production could change so dramatically that yield would be reduced , even accounting for the positive effect of CO ( 2 ) fertilization . In this study , we used the WOFOST crop growth simulation model to examine crop yield response to a set of plausible scenario of climate change for Finland up to 2100 , including some that exceed 4 degree C global mean temperature increase relative to pre-industrial . We selected spring barley ( Hordeum vulgare L ) a an indicator crop and calculated water-limited yield for two Finnish location , Jokioinen and Jyvaskyla and forum clay and a sandy soil . Scenarios included systematic increase in temperature , change in precipitation distribution and altered daily climatic variability using the M & Rfi weather generator . We also examined the effectiveness of a few adaptation option , such a shift in sowing date and hypothetical new crop cultivar . Increasing temperature reduced total growth duration and yield considerably , even with adjusted earlier sowing . A reduced number of rainy day had marked negative effect only in combination with increase in temperature of 4 degree C or greater , leading to distinctly higher yield loss on the sandy soil than on the clay . Prolonged dry spell clearly increased yield variability . For scenario with temperature increase of +6 degree C and +7 degree C , yield loss at Jokioinen were highest ; loss at Jyyaskyla were generally le pronounced . Neither CO ( 2 ) fertilization nor adjusted sowing could compensate the yield loss from temperature change exceeding +4 degree C. On clay soil , yield loss could be compensated by new cultivar . For sandy soil even with new cultivar , there would be yield loss at temperature increase exceeding +3 degree C. It can be concluded that the positive effect of climate warming and elevated CO ( 2 ) concentration on cereal production at high latitude are likely to be reversed at temperature increase exceeding 4 degree C , with a high risk of marked yield loss . Only plant breeding effort aimed at increasing yield potential jointly with drought resistance and adjusted agronomic practice , such a sowing , and adequate nitrogen fertilizer management and plant protection , hold a prospect of partly restoring yield level and reducing the risk of yield shortfall .

aVFaunal community have been shaped in different way by past climatic change . The impact of the termination of the last Glacial and the onset of the present ( Holocene ) Interglacial on large-scale faunal shift , extinction dynamic and gene pool of specie are of special interest in natural science . A general pattern of climate-triggered range expansion and local extinction of vertebrate specie is known for Europe , and show that in the modern temperate zone the main faunal change took place mainly during the Late Glacial ( 14 700-11 700 year ago ) and Early Holocene ( 11 700-9 100 year ago ) . Based on large datasets of new radiocarbon data , we present precise temporal dynamic of climate-driven disappearance and appearance of reindeer and pond turtle in southern Sweden . These two specie are significant climate indicator in Late Quaternary biostratigraphy . Our data reveal that the reindeer disappeared from southern Sweden ca . 10 300 year ago , whereas the pond turtle colonized the area ca . 9 860 year ago , with a 450-year gap between each specie . This provides evidence for a sudden environmental turnover , causing the replacement of an arctic faunal element by a thermophilic specie . The postglacial range dynamic of pond turtle and reindeer are a unique model case , allowing insight into the faunal turnover of other vertebrate during the last dramatic natural global warming event at the Pleistocene-Holocene transition .

aVSeveral study suggest that global climate change could increase the toxicity of contaminant , but none of these study explicitly integrate the effect of climate change on both susceptibility and duration of exposure to pollution . For many amphibian and aquatic insect specie , exposure to contaminant is probably greatest during their fully aquatic embryonic and larval stage because these stage can not readily escape water body where many contaminant accumulate and concentrate . Hence , by accelerating embryonic and larval development , global warming might reduce the duration of contaminant exposure for these taxon . To test this hypothesis , we isolated the effect of a temperature gradient ( 13-25 degree C ) on susceptibility ( toxicity at a controlled exposure duration ) and exposure of the streamside salamander , Ambystoma barbouri , to the herbicide atrazine ( 0 , 4 , 40 , and 400 mu g L-1 ) by quantifying growth , survival , hatching , and metamorphosis under an atrazine exposure duration that wa either constant or that depended on time to metamorphosis ( and thus temperature ) . Increasing atrazine concentration reduced growth , delayed hatching and metamorphosis , and decreased embryonic and larval survival . Increasing temperature enhanced growth , accelerated development , and reduced survival for embryo but not larva . With the exception of growth , increasing temperature generally did not enhance the toxicity of atrazine , but they did generally ameliorate the adverse effect of atrazine by accelerating development and reducing the duration of atrazine exposure . The actual effect of climate change on contaminant remains difficult to predict because temperature change can affect chemical use , uptake , excretion , biotransformation , fate , transport , and bioavailability . However , this work highlight the importance of explicitly considering how climate change will affect both exposure and toxicity to contaminant to accurately ass risk .

aVRecent crop model projection have shown that crop production may benefit from warming , especially in the high latitude , but hard evidence is limited . In this study we conducted correlation and regression analysis of climate record of seventy-two meteorological station and record of corn yield over the period 1965-2008 in Northeast China . It wa found that over these forty-four year . the diurnal mean , minimum and maximum temperature during corn growing season increased on average by 0.31 degree C , 0.42 degree C and 0.23 degree C every ten year , respectively . No significant change in precipitation wa found , although difference between year were large . The daily minimum temperature wa the dominant factor to corn production . Corn yield wa significantly correlated with the daily minimum temperature in May and September . According to a regression analysis of the anomaly of corn yield and air temperature , a 1.0 degree C increase in daily minimum temperature in May or September will lead to an increment of 303 kg ha ( -1 ) or 284 kg ha ( -1 ) in corn yield , respectively . Corn variety with longer growth duration will profit most from the climatic change but agronomic practice may have to be modified to address expected weather extreme such a drought and period with heavy rainfall .

aVThe development of cleaner and renewable energy source are needed in order to reduce dependency and global warming . Wood pellet are a clean renewable fuel and ha been considered a one of the substitute for fossil fuel . In Argentina , large quantity of sawmill residue are still unused and wood pellet production could be seen a both , a an environmental solution and an extra economical benefit . The general aim of this study wa to determine the wood pellet production cost and energy consumption under different framework condition in northeast Argentina . The specific cost of wood pellet for the different scenario showed relative lower cost comparing to the one reported in other study , ranging from 35 to 47 ( sic ) /Mg ( pellet ) . Raw material cost represented the main cost factor in the calculation of the total pellet production cost . A lower specific production cost wa observed when 50 % of the raw material input wa wood shaving . The specific electricity consumption per metric ton of pellet wa lower in scenario with higher production rate . Lower heat energy consumption wa observed in scenario that have a mixed raw material input . The most promising framework condition for Northeast Argentina , in term of cost effectiveness and energy consumption could be acquired with production rate of 6 Mg/h with sawdust and wood shaving a raw material . However , simultaneous increment of the electricity by 50 % and raw material price by 100 % may increase the specific cost up to 50 % . ( C ) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVGlobal warming along with the increasing population and fresh water shortage necessitates a specific fertilization programme under water-scarce condition . This study wa conducted to investigate the effect of different irrigation and nitrogen level on yield , growth component and water use characteristic of cauliflower ( Brassica oleracea L. var . Botrytis cv . Tetris-F ( 1 ) ) cultivated in a field for three consecutive year from 2005 to 2007 in the Eastern Mediterranean region of Turkey . Four irrigation ( Kcp ) level with a drip irrigation system based on adjustment coefficient ( 0 , 0.75 , 1.0 and 1.25 ) of pan evaporation were used . Nitrogen ( N ) treatment were consisted of four different nitrogen rate ( 0 , 75 , 150 and 225 kg N ha ( -1 ) ) . The following yield and quality parameter were determined : curd weight , curd diameter , number of leaf per crop , above ground biomass ( AGB ) and curd/AGB ratio . Fertilizer use efficiency ( FUE ) and leaf mineral content were also determined to clarify the productivity of N treatment . According to the result ; the amount of irrigation water and/or total received water affect the plant water consumption , consequently , crop yield in a field grown cauliflower . The highest yield wa obtained in Kcp ( 1.0 ) irrigation level which represents full irrigation treatment . The excess water application had negative effect on yield and AGB of cauliflower . Highest yield wa obtained at 225 kg N ha ( -1 ) . The water use efficiency and irrigation water use efficiency value increased with decreasing irrigation rate . However , lower Kcp coefficient resulted in lower total yield . The FUE in irrigation treatment showed linear increase from non irrigation to full irrigation plot . However , excessive irrigation caused a decrease in FUE . It can be recommended that the Kcp1.0 crop-pan coefficient with 225 kg ha ( -1 ) nitrogen application can be used to achieve the highest yield for field grown cauliflower in the Eastern Mediterranean coastal region of Turkey .

aVDecisions with intergenerational consequence may leave future generation worse off ( i.e. , not be Pareto-optimal ) if cost and benefit are not discounted correctly . We point out that this happens if the conventional social discount rate is applied to intergenerational cost : with that rate the justification of intergenerational cost ( benefit of a project are invested and the proceeds can cover future cost ) lead to an inconsistency over the long term ( eventually the supposed benefit of any project become larger than the entire GNP ) . The conventional approach commits an error by treating the time preference component of the discount rate a if it represented creation of wealth while it really involves only redistribution . The time horizon of the redistribution is limited by the duration of market transaction , especially loan . Thus we recommend a two-step discounting procedure , with the conventional social discount rate for the shea term ( about 30 year ) and the growth rate of the economy for the long term . Data for GNP per caput growth in the US , the UK , France , Germany , Japan and the Soviet Union since the industrial revolution , combined with data for net economic welfare per caput suggest an intergenerational discount rate in the range of 1 to 2 % . For practical application the rate at which cost and benefit will grow over time is just a important a the discount rate ; only the difference between these two rate matter . For many environmental cost these rate may be close to each other during the next few generation ; this implies that some of the uncertainty in the prediction of rate cancel and one can treat the problem a if the effective rate were close to zero . The consequence for cost such a global warming or nuclear power can be very significant : the valuation can increase by more than an order of magnitude compared to value based on conventional discounting .

aVPeatlands , hydromorphous soil with high organic matter content , display , a a result of anaerobic condition , a delayed litter decomposition and therefore constitute important terrestric sink for carbon and nitrogen compound . In spite of their relatively small area proportion of approx . 3 % ( 3.88-4.38 x 10 ( 6 ) km ( 2 ) ) , peatlands contain approx . 30 % of the world 's soil carbon and nitrogen reserve . Several sign indicate that substantial drainage and increasing temperature due to the increasing cultivation of peatlands and the global climate change could result in a large-scale conversion of peatlands from C/N sink to C/N source . Irrespective of many uncertain detail and complex interaction with other factor , the lowering of the groundwater table of peatlands actually seems to strongly enhance the net release of the radiatively active trace gas carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide , reducing at the same time the high emission of methane that occur in natural peatlands . The antizipated climate change will probably induce large-scale shift in the distribution of the different peatland ecosystem along with considerable change of the trace gas emission . In view of this development , a net loss of global peatland area along with an increase in their contribution to the greenhouse effect must be expected .

aVNatural mire generally act a sink for CO2 and are source of CH4 for the atmosphere . However , drainage may transform these ecosystem into net source of CO2 , but the increase in growth of the tree stand and consequent fixation of carbon after drainage may be expected to have a compensating effect . The post-drainage change in the peat carbon store wa determined using a method based on the bulk density and carbon content profile measured along a transect running from the undrained part to the drained part of the mire . The difference between the undrained and drained peat carbon store , averaged over the 30 yr period after drainage , indicated that the accumulation of carbon had been 35 g C m ( -2 ) yr ( -1 ) greater in the undrained site . As the long-term accumulation rate of the undrained site had been 21 g C m ( -2 ) yr ( -1 ) , the drained part had lost 14 g C m ( -2 ) yr ( -1 ) from the pre-drainage carbon store . Total accumulated biomass in the tree stand wa estimated from stem wood development using the growth and yield table for this site type . The stem wood volume were transformed into total biomass value using published stem-volume/total-biomass ratio . If no harvesting operation were to occur during the first 300 yr , the tree stand would produce an average carbon store of approximately 11 kg C m ( -2 ) . The application of a standard thinning regime would reduce this storage by ca 50 % . Expressed a an average over 300 yr , drainage increased the total carbon store of the mire if no tree harvesting wa done and the store remained unchanged if standard harvesting procedure were used .

aVRecent observation and general circulation model indicate that future temperature change linked to global warming might be characterized by a marked asymmetry between daytime maximum and nighttime minimum . We investigate the importance of such a pattern in determining future wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) yield in the Central United States by using a dynamic crop growth model , CERES-Wheat , modified to include physiological effect of temperature and CO2 on canopy photosynthesis . Simulations are run at four site spanning a north-south transect of the Central US ; four mean temperature increase ( 1-4 degree C ) are applied to baseline daily climate data ( 1951-1980 ) . The effect of two different scenario of temperature change ( minimum and maximum temperature equally raised ; minimum increased three time a much a maximum in agreement with recent observation ) are analyzed under both current ( 330 ppm ) and elevated ( 550 ppm ) CO2 concentration . The main mechanism controlling the simulated wheat response are direct and indirect temperature effect on wheat phenological development . Negative effect of temperature on simulated wheat yield are reduced when minimum increase more than maximum . Yield change are consistently negative under temperature change and current CO2 concentration , while they range from positive to negative under temperature change and elevated CO2 concentration . Responses vary across the transect , with larger negative effect occurring at the southernmost site .

aVJuvenile trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ) were exposed to a simulated global warming - acidic water scenario over a 90-day summer period ( control temperature range 13-24 degree C ) . The addition of 2 degree C to the fluctuating summer cycle of inshore Lake Ontario and H2SO4 to synthetic soft water resulted in four treatment : control , acidification of control , simulated global warming alone , and global warming plus acidification . The twice-daily feeding regime raised metabolic rate to similar to 75 % of Mo-2 ( max ) . Large increase ( from 4.5 to 11.5 % ) in whole-body lipid , smaller increase ( from 12.0 to 15.5 % ) in protein , and compensating decrease in water content ( from 77 to 71 % ) occurred in all treatment over time . The addition of 2 degree C resulted in depressed appetite and growth , particularly after the period of peak temperature ( day 60-90 ; 26 degree C ) . Metabolic rate and nitrogenous waste excretion were also depressed . Overall , exposure to low pH resulted in increased appetite and growth , the increase of 2 degree C reduced gross energy intake and increased fecal energy loss , and exposure to low pH resulted in increased energy intake and gain and better conversion efficiency . The lack of ionoregulatory disturbance in trout chronically exposed to pH 5.2 suggested that dietary NaCl may have compensated for branchial ion loss .

aVForage production in irrigated mountain meadow play a vital role in the livestock industry in Colorado and Wyoming . Mountain meadow are area of intensive fertilization and irrigation which may impact regional CH4 and N2O flux . Nitrogen fertilization typically increase yield , but N-use efficiency is generally low . Neither the amount of fertilizer-N recovered by the forage nor the effect on N2O and CH4 emission were known . These trace gas are long-lived in the atmosphere and contribute to global warming potential and stratospheric ozone depletion . From 1991 through 1993 study were conducted to determine the effect of N source , and timing of N-fertilization on forage yield , N-uptake , and trace gas flux at the CSU Beef Improvement Center near Saratoga , Wyoming . Plots were fertilized with 168 kg N ha ( -1 ) . Microplots labeled with N-15-fertilizer were established to trace the fate of the added N. Weekly flux of N2O and CH4 were measured during the snow-free period of the year . Although CH4 wa consumed when soil were drying , flood irrigation converted the meadow into a net source of CH4 . Nitrogen fertilization did not affect CH4 flux but increased N2O emission . About 5 % of the applied N wa lost a N2O from spring applied NH4NO3 , far greater than the amount lost a N2O from urea or fall applied NH4NO3 . Fertilizer N addition increased forage biomass to a maximum of 14.6 Mg ha ( -1 ) with spring applied NH4NO3 . Plant uptake of N-fertilizer wa greater with spring application ( 42 % ) , than with fall application ( 22 % ) .

aVInternational concern about the impact of global warming ha resulted in cooperative activity among developed and developing nation to address the issue . Already , developed country have agreed to reduce carbon dioxide emission to 1990 level by the year 2000 . At the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( FCCC ) , developed country agreed to meet the incremental cost of reducing the emission of greenhouse gas . One possible avenue for effecting the provision of the FCCC is joint implementation ( JI ) project involving developed and developing country . This article look at a sample of African country that are at different level of development . It identifies resource option that , when used in an integrated resource planning contact , prove to be cost effective a well a environmentally benign . II investigates these option , particularly energy efficient appliance and compact fluorescent lamp ( CFLs ) in term of their effect on the planning and operation of electric utility and on their emission of global warming gas . The author hope that the article will be helpful in developing criterion for selecting and prioritizing JI project . It focus on Africa because it appears that , unlike Asia and Latin America , the least amount of information ha been published for this continent in general .

aVAn in vitro bioassay ha been developed which show that oogenesis in Harmothoe imbricata is controlled by a gonadotrophic hormone which promotes egg protein synthesis in developing oocyte . A similar endocrine control mechanism is found in Eulalia viridis and analysis of in vivo assay indicate that the hormone act a a transducer between the environment and the gamete . The timing of gametogenesis is controlled by environmental cue in both specie and may be affected by predicted global climate change . With the development of these sensitive hormone assay it is possible to test the impact of climate change on both specie , providing a possible early warning system for global warming and potential bio-indicators of climate change . Harmothoe imbricata is likely to be the more sensitive indicator specie .

aVA new technique , called Free Air Temperature Increase ( FATI ) , wa developed to artificially induce increased canopy temperature in field condition without the use of enclosure . This acronym wa chosen in analogy with FACE ( Free Air CO2 Enrichment ) , a technique which produce elevated CO2 concentration [ CO2 ] in open field condition . The FATI system simulates global warming in small ecosystem of limited height , using infrared heater from which all radiation below 800 nm is removed by selective cut-off filter to avoid undesirable photomorphogenetic effect . An electronic control circuit track the ambient canopy temperature in an unheated reference plot with thermocouple , and modulates the radiant energy from the lamp to produce a 2 5 degree C increment in the canopy temperature of an associated heated plot ( continuously day and night ) . This pre-set target differential is relatively constant over time due to the fast response of the lamp and the use of a proportional action controller ( the standard deviation of this increment wa < 1 degree C in a 3 week field study with 1007 measurement ) . Furthermore , the increase in leaf temperature doe not depend on the vertical position within the canopy or on the height of the stand . Possible application and alternative design are discussed .

aVArctic freshwater ecosystem may be sensitive indicator of climatic warming trend because they have relatively few specie and simple food web . Many of these system are dominated by lake trout , which act a keystone predator . For arctic Alaska Toolik Lake , we have a 16-yr record of physical , chemical , and biological data . Our temperature data show a 3 degree C increase in mean July epilimnetic temperature . An individual-based bioenergetics model for young-of-year ( YOY ) lake trout in the lake wa used to examine the effect of climate warming on growth of YOY lake trout . Our simulation model predicted that with a July temperature increase , YOY lake trout would need to consume & gt ; 8-fold more food ( & gt ; 10-fold with seasonally increased temperature ) to achieve the same end-of-year size a historically surviving YOY lake trout . We have observed no increase in food availability in the lake , and recent analysis show that primary productivity ha actually decreased . If recent change in the lake foreshadow a long-term trend , our model result suggest that YOY lake trout will not survive their first winter . Such change , coupled with other current anthropogenic impact in the arctic , may disrupt lake trout control of the trophic structure in arctic lake .

aVThe Gent and McWilliams ( GM ) parameterization for large-scale water transport caused by mesoscale oceanic eddy is introduced into the oceanic component of a global coupled ocean-atmosphere model . Parallel simulation with and without the GM scheme are performed to examine the effect of this parameterization on model behavior under constant atmospheric CO2 and on the model response to increasing CO2 . The control ( constant CO2 ) run show substantial difference in the oceanic stratification and extent of convection , similar to difference found previously using uncoupled ocean model . The transient ( increasing CO2 ) run show moderate difference in the rate of oceanic heat sequestration ( le in the GM case ) , a expected based on passive tracer uptake study . However , the surface warming is weaker in the GM case , especially over the Southern Ocean , which is contrary to some recent supposition . Reasons for the reduced warming in the GM case are discussed .

aVA global warming trend began during the late Paleocene that culminated in the early Eocene with the highest global temperature of the Cenozoic , We have reconstructed late Paleocene surficial boundary condition and modeled atmospheric condition using the Goddard Institute for Spate Studies general circulation model version II ( GISS GCM II ) . These experiment were conducted to test the hypothesis that warm saline deep water formed during the late Paleocene and to understand atmospheric circulation near the beginning of a period of global warming . The warming is attributed primarily to increased sea surface temperature at high latitude . The sensitivity of the climate to ocean temperature wa tested using two sea surface temperature distribution , each delimited latitudinally by oxygen isotope value , but with different east-west gradient . The simulation discussed here contain several feature unique among warm climate experiment . The first experiment ( P-1 ) used latitudinally constant ( zonal ) sea surface temperature , The zonally distributed sea surface temperature strengthen the general circulation of the atmosphere . In particular , Hadley Cell circulation is intensified , leading to extreme of precipitation in the equatorial region and extreme evaporation across subtropical ocean , The unusual result prompted a second experiment with modern east-west sea surface temperature gradient superimposed and referred to a P-Gradient ( P-Grad ) . The east-west gradient in the sea surface temperature field exert a strong influence on the general atmospheric circulation , but the extreme zonality prevails , Under extreme zonal condition it is possible to create a model where evaporation is in excess of precipitation by a much a 3 mm/day . If this occurred in restricted area in a generally warmer ocean , such a the late Paleocene eastern Tethys Ocean and part of the South Atlantic Ocean , it should be possible to create very saline water , which could become a component in warm saline deep water formation .

aVFor climate modeling and atmospheric research , such a investigation of global climate change , remote sensing of cloud property , or the missing absorption problem in cloud , it is most important to describe adequately the absorption of radiation by atmospheric gas . An improved method for the exponential sum fitting of transmission ( ESFT ) is developed to approximate this absorption accurately . Exponentials are estimated separately for any number of atmospheric-model layer , considering the pressure and temperature dependence of the absorption line directly . As long a the error of the fit exceeds a limit of tolerance , the number of considered exponential term is successively increased . The accuracy of the method presented yield a root-mean-square error of le than 0.03 % for any atmospheric-model layer , whereas the commonly used one-layer technique gain error of up to 3 % in the transmission function for the upper layer . The commonly used ESFT method consider only one atmospheric layer and introduce the pressure and temperature effect for the other model layer afterwards .

aVPreliminary data are examined from a project in which the variability in the isotopic composition of precipitation across northern Canada and the implication for paleoclimatic reconstruction are examined . The data set show a geographic variability of about 6 part per thousand in isotopic composition of precipitation across the Canadian Arctic , roughly double the temporal variability seen in the ice core record from the last 10,000 year . The seasonal variability in average monthly delta ( 18 ) O value from the arctic station in 1991 wa a much a 26 part per thousand . A snow and firn core collected on Bylot Island had a range of 14.8 part per thousand , compared to the range in average monthly precipitation of 25.6 part per thousand covering the same time period . This difference in the observed seasonal range of value is the result of process operating in the snow pack , such a vapor movement and molecular diffusion , and the strategy used in sampling the core . The result indicate that a much better understanding of the geographic and seasonal variation in the delta ( 18 ) O value of precipitation is required before a direct linkage between the isotope record in ice core and global climate change can be determined . Using recently developed radiocarbon dating technique , buried glacier ice that ha been preserved in permafrost may be able to provide the greater spatial and temporal detail required .

aVA basic premise of ecological economics is that the world economy is embedded in and dependent upon Earth 's ecosystem . Because land is a basic source of mass and energy throughput in all terrestrial ecosystem , land use and cover represents an integrating element in ecological economics . We have developed a global model that capture this concept . We illustrate this concept 's usefulness by showing how global change in climate , human population , and international trade policy might affect tropical forest . Results from our scenario indicate that such change would likely have adverse effect on the health and integrity of tropical forest ecosystem . Results from our scenario also indicate that forest depletion in Southeast Asia can be correlated with numerous economic indicator . Whether the correlation with a particular economic variable is positive or negative depends on the global change scenario . This merely reflects the fact that interaction between economic and ecological phenomenon are complex . Modeling capability can be expanded by adding economic and ecological detail , including more material on throughput , and developing method for simulating dynamic analysis .

aVWith growing , concern about predicted global warming , increasing attention is being paid to the phytomass ( living plant mass ) component of forest stand and their role in the carbon cycle . The ability to predict phytomass component from commonly available inventory data would facilitate our understanding of the latter . We focus on Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris L. ) stand in Russia , with the objective of predicting stand phytomass ( Mg ha ( -1 ) ) for the four major stand component : needle , crown , stem , and root , The study area includes region in Russia where Scots pine is a stand-forming specie : from European Russia ( 33 degree E ) to Yakutia ( 130 degree E ) in eastern Siberia . To ensure that result will be widely applicable , only variable consistently measured in forest inventory were considered a possible predictor : stand age , site quality class , and stocking ( stand stem volume with bark , m ( 3 ) ha ( -1 ) ) . Stand phytomass data were obtained from numerous regional and local phytomass study , and supplemented with additional unpublished data . This is the first comprehensive study synthesizing stand level phytomass relation for P. sylvestris for most of it range in Russia . The combined result from over 18 regional and local phytomass study provide a level of generality that is not possible with individual local study . In addition to estimating stand phytomass component across a wide range of condition , these phytomass model can also be used to verify carbon allocation rule in process-based model .

aVIncreasing atmospheric carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) and nitrous oxide ( N2O ) level have prompted research on management of the soil C and N pool . The impact of C and N fertilizer addition on N2O and CO2 field emission is not clear . We determined N2O and CO2 flux from a 1-ha bare soil plot using micrometeorological method with the objective of evaluating the effect of management practice ( cultivation , irrigation , fertilizer , and sucrose application ) on the relative importance of both trace gas . Research wa conducted at the flora Research Station ( Typic Hapludalf ) in Ontario , Canada , over 7 mo . The N2O concentration gradient were measured using a Tunable Diode Laser Trace Gas Analyzer and the CO2 gradient using an Infra-Red Gas Analyzer . The transport coefficient were calculated using a Bowen Ratio Energy Balance and two wind profile approach . These three approach resulted in similar hourly flux . Daily N2O flux for nonevent period were 12 ng m ( -2 ) s ( -1 ) in 1991 , and 2 ng m ( -2 ) s ( -1 ) in the summer of 1992 , while CO2 flux before treatment in 1991 were 0.18 mg m ( -2 ) s ( -1 ) . Sucrose addition ( 420 kg C ha ( -1 ) ) resulted in the highest N2O and CO2 daily emission measured during the experiment at 3100 ng m ( -2 ) s ( -1 ) and 0.5 mg m ( -2 ) s ( -1 ) , respectively . Peak emission of 250 ng N2O m ( -2 ) s ( -1 ) were measured after wetting of dry soil ( WFP 0.6 ) . Carbon dioxide flux varied between 0.01 and 0.5 mg m ( -2 ) s ( -1 ) being the predominant gas contributing to an equivalent CO2 global-warming potential , but addition of sucrose increased the contribution of N2O to twice the contribution of CO2 . The combined effect of C and N addition ( e.g . manure and legume ) on the N2O emission in irrigated or high rainfall area should be considered in the effort of atmospheric C sequestering .

aVIn a model of ocean-atmosphere interaction that excluded biological process , the oceanic uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) wa substantially reduced in scenario involving global warming relative to control scenario . The primary reason for the reduced uptake wa the weakening or collapse of the ocean thermohaline circulation . Such a large reduction in this ocean uptake would have a major impact on the future growth rate of atmospheric CO2 . Model simulation that include a simple representation of biological process show a potentially large offsetting effect resulting from the downward flux of biogenic carbon . However , the magnitude of the offset is difficult to quantify with present knowledge .

aVBuried soil contain information which may be used to forecast soil change related to global climate warming . Average global warming by 0.8-1 degree C corresponds to the Holocene thermic optimum ( 5500-6000 year ago ) and warning by 1.8-2.0 degree C corresponds to the last Mikulino interglacial optimum ( 125 000 year ago ) . The reconstruction are regarded only a an element of the forecast . Drafts of scenario are suggested for Eastern Europe in case of global warning , taking into account equilibrium and non-equilibrium pedogenic model .

aVThis study us Global Circulation Models ( GCMs ) and the dynamic crop growth model CERES-Maize to ass the potential effect of climate change on corn ( Zea may L. ) in Zimbabwe . Corn is the most widely grown crop in Zimbabwe and is often under environmental stress due to high ambient temperature and low rainfall condition . Global climate change scenario suggest corn productivity in Zimbabwe will decrease dramatically under non-irrigated or irrigated condition in some region of agricultural production . The reduction in corn yield are primarily attributed to ambient temperature increase which shorten the crop growth period , particularly the grain-filling period . If climate effect occur farmer may find corn production an unacceptably risky activity . Adaptation option are available but financial cost may be prohibitive to communal area farmer .

Simulations of cool , warm , and intermediate year were rerun with meteorology from four general circulation model with a doubling of CO2 . In all simulation with doubled CO2 there is an earlier onset of stratification , increased summer epilimnetic temperature ( 1-7 degree C ) , and an increased intensity and longer duration of stratification . Maximum surface temperature at time may exceed upper lethal limit of warm and cool water fish in some scenario . Suitable thermal habitat for cold water , cool water , and warm water fish generally increase in all scenario after climate change . Changes in the vertical migration of Daphnia , however , are expected to vary depending on the interaction of thermal stratification and fish habitat use . In northern Wisconsin lake with cold water planktivores , habitat overlap between fish and zooplankton is expected to decrease , while in southern Wisconsin lake habitat overlap is expected to increase . Although most physical response of lake to climate change are consistent among all climate scenario , biological response will likely be more variable owing to the complex nature of factor determining ecological interaction in lake .

aVPotential impact of global climate change on fruit and vegetable yield in the US were investigated through simulation of citrus and potato . Simulated treatment included combination of three increased temperature regime ( +1.5 , +2.5 and +5.0 degree C ) , and estimate of the impact of three level of atmospheric carbon dioxide ( 440 , 530 , and 600 ppm ) in addition to control run representing current climatic condition . Adaptive planting date of -28 , -14 , +14 and +28 day were included in the potato simulation for current and increased temperature regime . Twenty-two site were simulated for citrus yield and 12 site for potato , using climate record from 1951 to 1980 . Response surface were developed for all combination of increased temperature and CO2 . Results of citrus simulation without CO2-induced yield improvement indicate that production may shift slightly northward in the southern state , but yield may decline in southern Florida and Texas due to excessive heat during the winter . CO2 effect tended to counteract the decline in simulated citrus yield . Fall potato production under current management practice appears vulnerable to an increase in temperature in the northern state ; increased CO2 and change in planting date were estimated to have minimal compensating impact on simulated potato yield .

aVGlobal warming is a problem in which the combustion of coal , oil ? and other fossil fuel cause the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gas , such a carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , to increase . This result in mounting global air temperature that lead to climatic change . Specifically , global warming will cause a rise in sea level , change in the rain-fall pattern , and other problem . In order to secure the route to solution for global warming that requires new response in way that are compatible with economic growth , it is essential to achieve breakthrough with innovative technology . In addition to energy-related R & D , also important are R & D for CO2 absorption and fixation for a fundamental solution to global warming . Japan ha started the development of innovative environmental technology , such a technology for CO2 fixation and utilization .

aVIn this paper , we discus past climatic trend over India , greenhouse gas emission due to energy consumption , forest and land-use change , climate change scenario for the year 2050 , potential consequence for agriculture and cyclone activity and the possibility that India might limit the increasing trend in it emission . India 's mean surface air temperature ha increased significantly by about 0.4 degree C over the past century . Neither monsoon nor annual rainfall show any significant trend . On average , there ha been a rise in sea level around India over recent decade , though considerable uncertainty exist in the accuracy and interpretation of the available data . Carbon emission from the energy sector amount to 71 MT a year , equivalent to all other sector combined . From land-use data , a marginal net sequestration of 5.25 million tonne of carbon occurred during 1986 . Following the IPCC guideline , methane emission from rice and livestock are estimated at 17.4 and 12.8 Tg/year , respectively . According to recent climate model projection , India may experience a further rise in temperature of 1 degree C by the year 2050 , about four time the rate of warming experienced over the past 100 year . A modest increase in precipitation amount might occur . Cereals production is estimated to decrease and the nutrition security of the population-rich but land-hungry region of India might be hampered . An increase in local tropical cyclone activity may occur over the next century , posing added problem a large area in the coastal region have a dense population . About 70 % of the electricity generation in India is from coal-based power station . Altering this dependence significantly to reduce emission would imply a substantial change in the present energy policy of India . There is great potential for improving energy efficiency and conservation . The adoption of cleaner coal-technologies should be considered , a must the development of renewable , non-conventional energy source . In all case , serious institulional barrier and resource limitation need to be addressed . The scope for carbon sequestration is limiled by land availabilily and other factor . It is argued that any response to global warming must be located firmly in the framework of sustainable development .

aVRecently , ocean acoustic tomography ( OAT ) ha been used to investigate the phenomenon of global warming and in wide-area oceanic observation . OAT can determine the sound-speed profile from measured acoustic travel time over known ray path . The seawater temperature profile and the existence of ocean current can be estimated using the sound-speed profile . However , the measured arrival time structure contains many pulse with different path . Ray geometry fundamental ( i.e. , number of turning point of ray , initial angle , etc . ) must be properly identified . The sound-speed structure varies with observation area ( i.e. , west Mediterranean Sea , low- , mid-latitude sea area , etc . ) and season . It ha been shown by the Japan Marine Science and Technology Center ( JAMSTEC ) that a special ocean structure with sound speed increasing linearly with depth is formed in the west Mediterranean Sea . We have to understand the characteristic of sound propagation for each sea area in advance . In this paper , the characteristic of sound propagation for an ocean model for area such a the west Mediterranean Sea have been analyzed in the time domain using Stickler 's normal mode method ( SNM ) . The effect of acoustic bandwidth ( ABW ) on the pattern of arrival have been examined .

aVWe manipulated , in accord with global-warming prediction , the thermal regime of a permanent first-order stream near Toronto , Ontario , Canada . We examined the effect of a 2-3.5 degree C water-temperature increase on density , biomass , specie composition , and life history of resident stream invertebrate . The stream wa divided longitudinally at the source into two channel , one control and one experimental , and a before and after ( BACI ) design wa employed such that one pre-manipulation year wa followed by 2 yr of the temperature manipulation . Changes in the experimental channel following commencement of the manipulation included : ( 1 ) decreased total animal density , particularly Chironomidae ( Diptera ) ; ( 2 ) earlier onset of adult insect emergence ; ( 3 ) increased growth rate and precocious breeding in Hyalella azteca ( Amphipoda ) ; ( 4 ) smaller size at maturity for Nemoura trispinosa ( Plecoptera ) and H. azteca ; and ( 5 ) altered sex ratio for Lepidostoma vernale ( Trichoptera ) . These result partially corroborate previous laboratory and field study . However , variation in the response of individual target specie to the manipulation wa unexpected and may have been influenced by the genetic structure of local population . We conclude that level of gene flow among habitat may be critical to the degree of impact seen a a result of large-scale thermal perturbation ( e.g. , global warming ) .

aVCoastal erosion is a worldwide problem ; it is estimated that over 70 % of the world 's beach are currently experiencing erosion ( Bird , 1985 ) , and this number may approach 90 % in the United States . ( 1 ) Almost every conceivable form of shore protection ha been attempted in the United States , including construction of seawall , groin , and jetty a well a beach nourishment . The principal approach to protecting coastal property and maintaining recreational beach in the United States today is beach nourishment . Engineering structure such a groin and seawall have often been shown to have detrimental effect on adjacent beach . Also , their construction and maintenance cost are quite high . Therefore , coastal community have come to rely on a ''soft '' engineering solution - beach nourishment because it is environmentally sound , aesthetically pleasing , and so far , economically feasible . However , global warming and accelerated sea level rise will cause more rapid rate of beach loss and could make even this alternative too costly for many resort area along the U.S. shoreline . The cost to nourish all the major recreational oceanic beach inthe United States wa estimated based on various sea level rise scenario . The beach nourishment approach involves placing enough sand on the beach to maintain stable ( nonretreating ) condition in response to rising sea level . The quantity of sand required to ''hold the line '' is evaluated under various sea level rise scenario fi-om the baseline scenario to the I-m estimate of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change . Beach nourishment is not a practical alternative for most Pacific island nation because sand is a scarce resource . In fad , beach are often mined for sand for construction , contributing to beach erosion For mainland country , beach fill project are more practical Singapore wa one of the first country to use this technology in combination with building offshore breakwater to form artificial headland . As Western style sunbathing and the overall popularity of beach for recreation continue to grow , beach nourishment can be expected to become a more common way to deal with sea level rise induced coastal erosion for highly developed beach resort area .

aVThe purpose of the study wa to ass the effect that global war ming and change in atmospheric CO2 concentration would have on grassland production within Scotland . This required the development of a mathematical model of herbage production that wa responsive to climatic factor and change in CO2 level . A model of pure grass and grass-white clover sward is described , and this ha been used to ass the effect that the predicted increase in temperature , rainfall and CO2 might have on grass and white clover production . It is projected that global warming will increase the length of the growing season by between 12 and 37 day for every 1 degree C rise in annual mean daily temperature . The indication are that global warming will have little effect on annual production of grass , either from pure grass or grass-white clover sward . On the other hand , white clover a a percentage of total herbage production is estimated to increase from 32 % to 46 % for a 2 degree C temperature rise . Nevertheless , increasing concentration of CO2 is predicted to increase the yield of grass and white clover under both current climatic condition and the global warming scenario .

aVThe potential impact of global warming and the enhanced atmospheric CO2 concentration on grassland management on dairy farm within the UK requires assessment . This ha led to the development of a mathematical model of the grazing dairy cow . The model , that embrace grass and grass-white clover sward , ha been used to ass the effect that the projected increase in temperature and rainfall under global warming and the increased level of CO2 might have on milk production and on silage conservation for a typical dairy farm . The result suggest that the impact on milk production for grass-based system will vary depending on the locality . On the other hand , for herd grazed on grass-white clover sward milk output might increase regardless of site , when the concentration of CO2 is enhanced . As regard silage production from grass-white clover sward , under global warming and at current level of CO2 there is an apparent tendency to increase the percentage of total silage yield obtained from the first cut , although this doe nor occur for grass sward . At the same time , there are also indication that global warming will increase the percentage of clover in the herbage cut for conservation . Copyright ( C ) 1996 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd

aVThe perceived decline of soil science in the industrialized country need to be remedied by greater attention ( i ) to fundamental aspect of soil process and soil development in the context of global climate change and ( ii ) to local and regional environmental problem , Soil care is proposed a a unifying concept and challenge for geoecological sustainability , It is defined a the activity of selecting and implementing , locally and regionally , a system of soil and land use management suitable for maintaining and improving soil usefulness and quality for any selected purpose , In developing country where , in addition , improvement of soil productivity will remain the major goal , more locally trained soil scientist will be needed to increase their relative proportion among the current number of some 50,000 soil scientist worldwide and to narrow the gap in research effort .

aVThis study outline an original tool for rural policy planning in southern Europe . This new tool is a process-based , scale-dependent , rural policy-making approach , which is designed to address increasing land degradation problem in southern Europe . Seven important process are identified ( land abandonment , devegetation , intensification in agriculture , global climate change , accelerated soil erosion , increasing water demand , urbanisation ) and plotted on a space-time diagram , which clearly show the spatial and temporal scale for which these process are significant for landscape change in southern Europe . Conclusions are derived concerning , in particular , sustainable ( optimal ) rural policy-making for southern Europe 's problematic land management . An optimal spatial-temporal scale for land management in southern Europe may range spatially from the ''farm '' ( 0.5 km ( 2 ) ) to ''sub-provincial '' level ( 450 km ( 2 ) ) and temporally from 7 to 30 year . The study delineates method and result derivable from such a new policy-planning approach and suggests the usefulness of combining this approach with ecological land classification at the landscape level .

aVObserved change in average global temperature over time have led to two general avenue of discussion in the environmental literature . The scientific community ha concentrated on the statistical detection of global warming and the determination of biological and industrial factor causing average world temperature to rise . A second avenue of thought considers the issue of economic abatement by attempting to measure the pecuniary cost of global warming and the elimination of factor influencing this problem . This paper concentrate not on developing an economic model of global warming and environmental damage , but rather on examining the problem from a purely statistical vantage point . Utilizing annual data from 1950 to 1991 and optimally determined vector autoregression specification , it is shown that general industrial growth and greenhouse gas emission level statistically cause a persistent increase in average global temperature . In addition , this analysis show that increasing average world temperature have a statistically significant negative causal impact on agricultural productivity . Given that global warming is a long-term process culminating from decade of industrial activity , statistically significant causal result derived in this paper using shortterm data are interesting . Statistical result suggest that trend in average temperature respond to short-run fluctuation in industrial activity and population growth .

aVI investigate the response of the present-day thermohaline circulation to a greenhouse gas induced global warming under different surface thermohaline condition in a global Bryan/Cox [ Bryan , 1969 ; Cox , 1989 ] ocean general circulation model with realistic bathymetry and geometry . Initially the model is spun up With surface temperature and salinity relaxed to Levitus [ 1982 ] climatology . The forcing condition for salinity is then switched to a diagnosed flux , while that for temperature is provided by a restoration with a timescale of either 30 day ( strong relaxation ) or 300 day ( weak relaxation ) . The present-day ocean climate is obtained under these two set of thermohaline condition . Under the strong restoration the modeled North Atlantic Deep Water Formation ( NADWF ) settle to an intensified state . Under the weak relaxation the model solution hardly differs from that of the spin-up . The ocean state are then subject to a global warming at a rate similar to that of the double CO2 experiment in a fully coupled model described by Manabe and Stouffer [ 1993 , 1994 ] . The global thermohaline circulation under the weak relaxation show an initial weakening and shallowing , continued weakening upon the cessation of the atmospheric warming , and eventual reestablishment of their strength . These behavior pattern are not unlike those found in the fully coupled model but are in sharp contrast to those in the case under the strong restoration , where NADWF eventually collapse . The process responsible for these difference are discussed .

aVA methodology is presented for generating surrogate climate-change scenario with a regional climate model . The procedure is simple to implement and dynamically consistent . It entail ( i ) adopting a realized or simulated atmospheric flow evolution and ( ii ) prescribing specific thermodynamic modification of this realization to a regional model 's initial field and externally-specified time-dependent lateral boundary field . The resulting scenario can be used for process and parameterization study , to calibrate the regional response to a putative global climate change , and to intercompare different model . The approach is illustrated with two month-long regional climate model simulation . The experiment is designed to explore the response within Europe to a pseudo-global warming of 2 K with an accompanying increase in atmospheric water vapor content . Analysis reveals that there is a spatially-differentiated preciptation increase consonant with the domain-averaged increase of about 16 % in the water vapor content .

aVResearch into technology for removal of CO2 considered to be the major cause of global warming , wa applied to electric power plant flue gas . Our method wa to use zeolite a adsorbent for physical adsorption , progressing from the previously used PSA ( Pressure Swing Adsorption ) method to the more advanced PTSA ( Pressure and Temperature Swing Adsorption ) method . We have been conducting basic research since the 1980s , and in 1991 built a 1000m ( 3 ) N/h scale pilot plant , where we are continuing research through trial operation . Trial operation of the pilot plant ha been mainly for acquisition of scale up data , a well a improvement in the decrease in the power consumption of PTSA unit . As a result , we have seen a better than 20 % improvement in that area . In addition , the pilot plant completed 2000 hour of continuous operation without incident between October and December , 1994 . The total hour of operation of the plant have topped 4000 hour , but we have seen no decrease in the effectiveness of the CO2 adsorbent . The SOx in the flue gas wa trapped in the lower part of desiccant in PSA-H2O before the process . Some of desiccant reacts to that , but we have prevented any ill effect on the process that might be caused by main unit . At this point we would like to report on the result of our research , a well a outline our plant for the future .

aV1 . Lake temperature vary with season , latitude , elevation and a a result of thermal pollution . Ln addition , lake temperature may increase with global warming . Radiotracer experiment were conducted to determine the effect of temperature on the bioaccumulation of lipophilic organic contaminant by zooplankton . Daphnia pulex were exposed to C-14-labelled DDE , a stable metabolite of the organochlorine pesticide DDT , in particle-free water for 24 h. An increase in temperature from 5 to 25 degree C resulted in a 314 % increase in bioconcentration factor ( the ratio of contaminant concentration in the organism to contaminant concentration in the water ) . 2 . To mimic the fluctuating temperature experienced by zooplankton during diel vertical migration , we conducted experiment in which animal were exposed to 25 degree C for 12 h in the light , then 15 degree C for 12 h in the dark . Exposure to this fluctuating temperature regime for 48h resulted in a 27-33 % increase in bioconcentration factor relative to a constant 20 degree C control . 3 . Live animal accumulated more than twice the amount of DDE than freshly killed animal , indicating that the activity of the organism is important in bioconcentration . This finding shed light on the possible mechanism for the increase in bioconcentration at higher constant temperature . Daphnia pump more water through their branchial chamber at higher temperature . Thus , if the thoracic limb are an important site of contaminant uptake , then animal are exposed to more contaminant molecule at higher temperature . Other possible mechanism include change in the thickness of the diffusive boundary layer and change in cell membrane permeability .

aVThe Mackenzie Basin in northwestern Canada cover approximately 1.8 million km ( 2 ) and extends from 52 degree N to 70 degree N. Much of the Basin is currently too cool and remote from market to support a viable agricultural sector , but the southern portion of the Basin ha the physical potential to support commercial agriculture . This case study employed agricultural land rating and crop model to estimate the degree to which a CO2-induced global warming might alter the physical potential for commercial agriculture throughout the Basin . The two climate change scenario considered in this analysis would relax the current constraint imposed by a short and cool frost-free season , but without adaptive measure , drier condition and accelerated crop development rate were estimated to offset potential gain stemming from elevated CO2 level and warmer temperature . In addition to striving for a better understanding of the extent to which physical constraint on agriculture might be modified by climate change , there is a need to expand the research context and to consider the capacity of agriculture to adapt to altered climate .

aVThe natural greenhouse effect of the Earth is strongly influenced by the radiative effect of water vapour and cloud in the atmosphere , which control the energy absorbed from the sun , and that lost through thermal emission to space . Any perturbation to the climate balance , for example through so-called 'radiative forcing ' due to increasing CO2 amount , variation in solar constant , or other cause , can be amplified by the feedback process that involve water in it various phase . The radiative cooling of the Earth in the absence of cloud ha recently been shown to be dominated by emission from upper-tropospheric water vapour , in the far infrared portion of the spectrum , and this is illustrated : observation of this radiative flux , and of the distribution of water vapour in the upper troposphere , are urgently needed . The role of cloud is discussed , and it is noted that their response to global warming is not presently unambiguously determined with available model , due to the complexity of competing process : again , a in the cloud-free case , more accurate global observation are needed . The paper is illustrated by data from satellite experiment , most notably the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment sponsored by NASA .

aVReduced amount of snow in the eight winter from 1986-87 to 1993-94 at Nagaoka , Japan , seem to he due to a winter air-temperature rise . The winter air temperature ha shown a cyclic variation with a gradual increase in the past 100 year . The linear rate of the temperature rise in the past century wa calculated a 1.35 degree C per 100 year . Both the maximum snow depth and winter precipitation showed an inversely positive correlation with winter mean air temperature . The square of the statistical correlation coefficient r ( 2 ) wa calculated a 0.321 and 0.107 , respectively . Statistically smoothed curve of the maximum snow depth and winter precipitation showed maximum value in 1940 . Fluctuations in deviation of the maximum snow depth showed smaller value than in precipitation . The minimum winter mean air temperature obtained from a 10 year moving average curve wa found in 1942 , and the deviation from the climatic mean changed from negative to positive in 1949 . The change in sign of the temperature deviation and the increase of the deviation may be attributable to global warming .

aVThe response and feedback of forest system to global environmental change , including the ecosystem of West Africa , are expected to be profound . A comparative assessment of current and future forest distribution in Cameroon and Ghana in response to land-use change and global climate change wa completed . From 1970 to 1990 , the forest area of Cameroon and Ghana declined dramatically due to harvesting and degradation , averaging 0.6 and 1.3 % each year , respectively . The areal distribution of West African forest system is projected to shift 5 to 15 % , based on 4 General Circulation Model ( GCM ) scenario and the Holdridge Life Zone Classification System . Loss of forest habitat due to destruction , degradation and climate change is projected to increase animal and plant specie loss . Adaptation of evergreen and deciduous forest system to global environmental change pose many challenge for Cameroon and Ghana . Application of low-input , indigenous resource management option , which have been practiced on a sustained basis for century , may be a feasible adaptation goal .

aVThe impact of global climate change on forest distribution wa evaluated using the Holdridge life zone and GISS general circulation model scenario . Across Zimbabwe , 17 to 18 % of the total land area is projected to shift from subtropical thorn woodland and subtropical dry forest to tropical very dry forest under the GISS scenario . The projected shift in forest distribution is attributable to a future decline in precipitation pattern and an increase in ambient temperature .

aVThe phasing out of fully halogenated halocarbon becomes effective at the end of 1995 by international agreement . Under the same ozone depletion issue , the companion fluid HCFCs are suffering a similar fate , a they are considered controlled substance with a virtual phase-out by 2020 , and more drastic reduction may be proposed in the near future . Some international action might also be agreed upon on refrigerant with regard to the threatened environmental emergency of anthropogenic global warming . Therefore , in choosing replacement fluid primary concern must be given to minimising the total warming impact , which , for most application , call for improved energy efficiency . During recent year , industry ha scrutinised and proposed a number of new synthesised product a immediate drop-in or long-term replacement for fluid harmful to the environment . Together with some single-component new generation refrigerant , quite a few two-component , three-component or even four-component mixture , both with zeotropic and azeotropic behaviour , are being considered . The main issue associated with the use of the new generation refrigerant are discussed , such a behaviour with oil ; flammability ; efficient use of temperature glide , fractionation and heat-transfer degradation with zeotropic mixture . The full environmentally friendly option of resorting to natural fluid is also considered by examining some recent innovative application a refrigerant of some hydrocarbon , ammonia , carbon dioxide , water and air .

aVAnti-coal and some investment policy are widely justified with reference to global warming , Political analysis suggests that these policy are supported by the reinforcing interest of three powerful lobby : scientific institution engaged in atmospheric research and earth observation , energy corporation harmed by low fossil fuel price or supplying 'clean ' technology , and numerous interlocking bureaucracy , Together they have succeeded in maintaining momentum in current climate negotiation , The scientific consensus which underpins the climate treaty is examined critically , It is argued that support for emission abatement policy is better explained with reference to diplomatic interest in the globalisation of energy related investment and trade than understood causality between average global surface warming and fossil fuel combustion .

aVIn an era of heightened awareness of energy efficiency and the associated environmental impact , many industry worldwide are exploring `` environmentally friendly '' technology that provide equivalent or improved performance while reducing or eliminating harmful side-effects . The refrigeration and air-conditioning industry , due to it reliance on CFCs and HCFCs , ha invested in research in alternative to the industry standard vapor compression machine . One alternative technology with great promise is chemical absorption . Absorption chiller ; offer comparable refrigeration output with reduced SO2 CO2 , and NOX emission . Absorption chiller do not use CFCs or HCFCs , refrigerant that contribute to ozone depletion and global warming . Additionally , gas-fired absorption chiller can save significant amount in energy cost when used in combination with a vapor compression chiller in a hybrid system . The hybrid system can take advantage of the comparatively low price of natural gas ( per unit ton ) and rely on the high performance of vapor compression when electricity price are lower . The purpose of this article is to provide an introduction for those new to absorption technology a well a a discussion of selected high efficiency cycle , a discussion on the technology of coupling absorption with vapor compression system to form a hybrid system , and the environmental impact of absorption .

aVPaddy field are regarded a one of the most important source of methane emission which is enhancing global warming . To estimate decomposition process of organic carbon in paddy soil quantitatively , firstly , kinetics of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic carbon ( C ) were investigated in laboratory experiment with or without organic amendment at 5 , 20 , 30 and 40 degree C for 84 day of incubation . Produced CH4 , CO2 and accumulated fatty acid were measured periodically , and first-order kinetics model were applied to the amount of decomposed C. Two component ' model fitted decomposition pattern for unamended soil , but not for glucose or alanine-amended soil . To compare the parameter included in the model with those of adjacent upland soil , paddy soil contained smaller but faster component of decomposable organic matter . Secondly , methane emission from paddy soil wa examined in paddy soil microcosm to find the possible mitigation option for reduction of the emission . Ammonium sulfate and potassium sulfate ( S ) were applied to compare with ammonium chloride and potassium chloride ( C ) . Additionally ferrous oxide ( F ) wa also applied to half set of each treatment to make totally four treatment . Methane emission rate wa significantly reduced by addition of S , much more effective than addition of F. Gas formation in the soil corresponded with the amendment , and the ratio of produced CH4 to CO2 decreased by addition of S at peak time of methane emission . ( C ) 1997 IAWQ .

aVThe most consistent mean of investigating the global sea ice cover is by satellite passive microwave sensor , a these are independent of illumination and cloud cover . The Nimbus 7 Scanning Multichannel . Microwave Radiometer ( SMMR ) and the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program ( DMSP ) Special Sensor Microwave Imager ( SSMI ) provide information on the global sea ice cover from 1978 to present . The two instrument flew simultaneously during a 6-week overlap period in July and August 1987 , thus enabling intercomparison of the two sensor . Brightness temperature are corrected for instrument drift and calibration difference in order to produce continuous time series of monthly averaged Arctic and Antarctic sea ice extent and sea ice area through the use of the NOr-wegian Remote Sensing EXperiment ( NORSEX ) algorithm , which relates brightness temperature to ice concentration . Statistical analysis on the time series estimate the decrease in Arctic ice extent and ice area to be 4.5 % and 5.7 % , respectively , during the 16.8-year observation period . The overall trend established here serve to better define and strengthen earlier assertion of a reduced ice cover , based on analysis of SMMR and SSMI data taken separately . These result are consistent with GCM simulation that suggest retreat of the sea ice cover under global warming scenario .

aVBased on field measurement in two agricultural ecosystem , soil respiration and long-term response of soil organic carbon content ( SOC ) wa modelled . The model predicts the influence of temperature increase a well a the effect of land-use over a period of thirty year in a northern German glacial moraine landscape . One of the field carried a maize monoculture treated with cattle slurry in addition to mineral fertilizer ( ''maize monoculture '' ) , the other wa managed by crop rotation and received organic manure ( ''crop rotation '' ) . The soil of both field were classified a cambic Arenosols . The soil respiration wa measured in the field by mean of the open dynamic inverted-box method and an infrared gas analyser . The mean annual soil respiration rate were 268 ( maize monoculture ) and 287 mg CO2 m ( -2 ) h ( -1 ) ( crop rotation ) . Factors controlling soil respiration were soil temperature , soil moisture , root respiration and carbon input into the soil . Q ( 10 ) -values of soil respiration were generally higher in winter than in summer . This trend is interpreted a an adaptive response of the soil microbial community . In the model a novel mathematical approach with variable Q ( 10 ) -values a a result of temperature and moisture adjustment is proposed . With the calibrated model soil respiration and SOC were calculated for both field and simulation over a period of thirty year were established . Simulations were based on ( 1 ) local climatic data , 1961 until 1990 , and ( 2 ) a regional climate scenario for northern Germany with an average temperature increase of 2.1 K. Over the thirty year period with present climate condition , the SOC pool under ''crop rotation '' wa nearly stable due to the higher carbon input , whereas about 16 t C ha ( -1 ) were lost under ''maize monoculture '' . Under global warming the mean annual soil respiration for both field increased and SOC decreased by ca . 10 t C ha ( -1 ) under ''crop rotation '' and by more than 20 t C ha ( -1 ) under ''maize monoculture '' . It wa shown that overestimation of carbon loss in long-term prognosis can be avoided by including a Q ( 10 ) -adjustment in soil respiration model .

aVCurrent climate and climate change scenario are the basis for climate change vulnerability and adaptation study . Comparison between the current situation and the one that would prevail under climate change condition allows for the identification of vulnerable region and the quantification of vulnerability . This may be done by evaluating the land area adversely affected by climate change ( e.g . with reduction in agricultural yield or decrease in the level of water reservoir ) . Specific regionalization criterion and method based on physical consideration should be applied in the development of regional climate scenario . This is the principle followed in study using analogue scenario . A methodology based on the direct interpolation of general circulation model ( GCM ) output to the study region under 1xCO ( 2 ) and 2xCO ( 2 ) condition may be used a a first approach for the development of climate change scenario . That methodology wa applied in this study in order to be consistent with the assessment performed by more than 50 country involved in the U.S. Country Studies Program and to allow for the comparison and integration of the result from several country . However , an alternative methodology based on multiple regression wa also applied by the Scenario task group of the Mexico Country Study . This methodology is considered to be more appropriate for regionalization purpose .

aV1 . The correlation between climatic variable and past ( up to 20 year ) growth wa studied in seven circumarctic population of the moss Hylocomium splendens , using retrospective analysis of growth . We hypothesized that relationship between growth and climate would be simpler in an ectohydric moss than in higher plant and that the moss could provide high signal-to-noise ratio of response to climatic variation . 2 . Growth parameter of the moss were strongly correlated with early summer temperature and with the length of the growing season . Annual segment mass , growth rate and degeneration rate were highest at the mildest subarctic site and lowest at the high arctic site . In contrast , 'longevity ' ( age of the oldest segment ) increased at the climatically harsher site . 3 . Between-year growth variation at two contrasting site were significantly correlated with June and July temperature and , to a lesser extent , with early-season precipitation at one of the site . 4 . The moss currently tolerates a wide range of climate and large interannual variation in temperature and is likely to be at risk from climatic change only at the southern edge of it range . 5 . The climate-change component most likely to affect the growth of H. splendens in the Arctic and Subarctic will be a lengthening of the growing season and in increase in early summer temperature provided that moisture is not limiting . 6 . Hylocomium splendens is a suitable specie for monitoring climatic change at a circumarctic scale .

aVBleaching in stony coral is the result of a disruption of the symbiosis between the coral host and photosynthetic microalgal endosymbionts ( zooxanthellae ) . Coral bleaching may be induced by a variety of environmental stimulus , including increased seawater temperature . Large-scale bleaching episode have been suggested to be linked to global warming . We have discovered that coral bleaching , in this case , bleaching of the Mediterranean coral Oculina patagonica , is caused by a bacterid infection and that water temperature is a contributing factor . The causative agent , Vibrio AK-1 , wa present in 28 bleached O. patagonica examined , but absent from 24 healthy ( unbleached ) coral . The Vibrio sp . wa isolated in pure culture , characterized microbiologically , and shown to cause bleaching when inoculated onto unbleached coral . An increase in seawater temperature may influence the outcome of bacterial infection by lowering the resistance of the coral to infection and/or increasing the virulence of the bacterium . When inoculated with 10 ( 6 ) Vibrio AK-1 ml ( -1 ) at 26 degree C , bleaching began at around 10 d and affected more than 80 % of the coral after 44 d. Bleaching did not occur under the same condition in the presence of antibiotic or if the temperature wa lowered to 16 degree C .

aVComprehensive statistical analysis of field measurement of CO2 flux in ecosystem of typical subarctic tundra in Taymir Peninsula ( Central Siberia , Russia ) wa performed . Simulation model allowing to compute integrate seasonal value of basic component of carbon balance in the most characteristic plant community of typical tundra were built . To access the landscape pattern of tundra carbon balance we applied GIS-approach based on the original computer map of ecosystem border . In 1994 the seasonal ( from the beginning of snow melting till the end of total soil freezing ) carbon balance of typical tundra landscape wa estimated a -4 g C . m- ( 2 ) . year ( -1 ) ( carbon sink ) , the ecosystem total respiration a +145 g C . m ( -2 ) . year ( -1 ) , and gross primary production a -149 g C . m ( -2 ) year ( -1 ) . Such a poorly expressed carbon sink conceptually should be considered a landscape equilibrium . Nevertheless the subsequent computer simulation of climate change confirmed the hypothesis of positive feedback between global warming and change of carbon balance pattern in tundra ecosystem from sink to source . From the other side we found that regional peculiarity of ecological and climatic condition can strongly effect the climate global change appearance .

aVTo understand the total impact of human on the carbon cycle , the modeling and quantifying of the transfer of carbon from terrestrial pool to the atmosphere is becoming more critical . Using previously published data , this research sought to ass the change in carbon pool caused by human in the Lower Fraser Basin ( LFB ) in British Columbia , Canada , since 1827 and define the long-term , regional contribution of carbon to the atmosphere . The result indicate that . there ha been a transfer of 270 Mt of carbon from biomass pool in the LFB to other pool , primarily the atmosphere . The major loss of biomass carbon have been from logged forest ( 42 % ) , wetland ( 14 % ) , and soil ( 43 % ) . Approximately 48 % of the forest biomass , almost 20 % of the carbon of the LFB , lie within old-growth forest , which cover only 19 % of the study area . landfill are now becoming a major sink of carbon , containing 5 % of the biomass carbon in the LFB , while biomass carbon in building , urban vegetation , mammal , and agriculture is negligible . Approximately 26 % of logged forest biomass would still be in a terrestrial biomass pool , leaving 238 Mt of carbon that ha been released to the atmosphere . On an area basis , this is 29 time the average global emission of carbon , providing an indication of the past contribution of developed country such a Canada to global warming and possible contribution from further clearing of rainforest in both tropical and temperate region .

aVResource-cascading , the sequential exploitation of the full potential of a resource during it use , is one of the way to improve efficiency of raw material use . In this article it is shown that cascading of the renewable resource pinewood can lead to large saving in primary resource use . For pine wood a cascade of five or six step can be set up which extends the time that the resource is in use from about 75 to more than 350 year . Cascading also mean that , when using wood , the moment that carbon dioxide is emitted , is postponed . This is interesting in relation to global warming . In the Netherlands , a country where labour is relatively expensive , part of this cascade are realised in practice . Until now , however only a small percentage of the total amount of wood is cascaded . To favour cascading of wood several option may be considered , such a eco-taxation of resource , prohibition to dump waste-wood and a 'wood-bank ' showing which kind of wood with certain property is available at a certain moment .

aVRelative water content ( RWC ) and water potential were compared for leaf of several plant specie exposed to a warming manipulation at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory , near Crested Butte , Colorado , USA , to test the hypothesis that species-specific change in water relation parameter will occur in response to future increase in planetary air temperature . Leaves of Artemisia tridentata , Erigeron speciosus , Festuca thurberi , Helianthella quinquinervis , Potentilla fruticosa , Potentilla gracilis and Rhodiola integrifolia were collected from plant growing in situ in control and infrared ( IR ) -heated ( 22 W m ( -2 ) ) plot in a meadow near the upper elevational distribution limit for A. tridentata . For six of the seven herbaceous specie , RWC wa not significantly different from that for A. tridentata ( 0.903+/-0.019 on control plot and 0.846+/-0.031 from heated plot ) . However , RWC wa 0.644+/-0.04 and 0.596+/-0.029 for F. thurberi on control and heated plot , respectively . Water potential ( Psi ) varied from -1.04 MPa for A. tridentata ( control plot ) to -4.83 MPa for leaf of F. thurberi ( heated plot ) ; Psi for the other specie ranged from -1.08 MPa ( R. integrifolia on control plot ) to -2.62 MPa ( P. gracilis on heated plot ) . To characterize further the response of water relation parameter to the IR heating treatment , pressure-volume isotherm were generated for A. tridentata and P. gracilis . Both specie exhibited effect of the IR heating treatment on saturated osmotic potential and the relative symplastic water content . Based on change in osmotic potential and relative water content , an increase in osmotically active solute wa exhibited for leaf collected from plant under heater . Species-specific pattern of RWC and water potential ( a well a effect on cellular water relation ) may influence the ability of plant specie to cope with change in soil water content that are expected to occur with global warming for montane ecosystem in the western USA .

aVTo ass the influence of temperature on the impact of allelochemicals on the growth of insect herbivore . we examined the interaction between allelochemicals and warmer night-time temperature on an insect herbivore , Manduca sexta ( L. ) and tomato plant . We compared the effect of four thermal regime with a standard day-time temperature of 26 degree C and the night-time temperature varying from 14 to 26 degree C by increment of 4 degree C. Increasing concentration of chlorogenic acid and tomatine reduced developmental rate linearly . At 26:22 degree C , there wa also a quadratic effect , such that intermediate concentration had a disproportionately large negative effect . Furthermore , the negative effect of the allelochemicals were le at the 26:14 degree C regime . These result differ from another study examining a different insect specie , which suggests that the response to incremental change in night-time temperature will vary with the allelochemicals and insect specie tested . However . some consistent pattern for M. sexta have emerged . The negative effect on caterpillar development of increasing allelochemical concentration changed across the gradient in night-time temperature . At one thermal regime ( 26:22 degree C ) , M. sexta growth wa disproportionately reduced by intermediate concentration of each of three allelochemicals tested .

aVIt is widely proposed that the global warming is mainly caused by the increase in of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) content in the atmosphere , and that fossil fuel are the dominant source of this CO2 . Therefore , the quality of fossil fuel tends to be evaluated by amount of CO2 emission . For the evaluation of an oil shale from this point an on-line thermogravimetric-gas chromatographic system wa used to measure CO2 evolution profile on temperature with a small oil shale sample . This method make possible to estimate the amount of CO2 evolved from kerogen and carbonate in retorting and those from carbonate in combustion , respectively . These result will be basic data for a novel oil shale retorting process for the control of CO2 emission . The profile for Thai and Colorado oil shale have shown CO2 mainly evolved by the pyrolysis of kerogen below 550 degree C , and that evolved by the decomposition of carbonate above that temperature . On the other hand , the profile for Condor oil shale showed that most carbonate decomposed below 550 degree C , while only small amount of carbonate decomposed above this temperature .

aVProvenance trial have been used to project the response of forest tree to change in temperature resulting from the expected global warming . In such experiment the difference in temperature are brought about through geographical transfer over altitude and latitude . Transfers over latitudinal distance are also accompanied by change in light climate . To distinguish between the effect of temperature and light , study were made in a Pious sylvestris . L. provenance series in Sweden : in the series both the site and the provenance are distributed over large latitudinal and altitudinal range . The response to annual temperature sum and latitude were calculated using multiple regression analysis , Both projected dominant height at age 100 year ( H100 ) and mean annual yield increment over the rotation responded linearly to increasing temperature sum . The response to temperature sum decreased with increasing southward transfer . Latitudinal transfer without change in temperature sum did not affect the performance of the population . The projected response of population to gradual warming will be le than projected on the basis of the final or the average temperature sum over the rotation period .

aVTrifolium repens ( white clover ) stolon were inoculated with Ditylenchus dipsaci ( stem nematode ) , and the development of resulting infestation wa monitored . Nematodes initially remained confined to superficial location , concentrating in petiole axil near inoculation point . They were able to migrate slowly from the initial inoculation point and infest adjacent axil , especially in region near the stolen tip . As time progressed , in some axil , nematode migrated through the stolen epidermis and colonized slowly expanding subepidermal pocket of host tissue ( ca , 0.2-mm length of stolon/day ) . In these locus nematode established exponentially increasing population , but the rate of locus expansion remained constant , indicating that locus expansion wa limited by unidentified host-dependent factor . As a result of increasing population pressure within subepidermal locus , J4 entered a ''diapause '' state and the rate of egg production by adult declined , thereby reducing rate of population growth to more sustainable level . Typically , these population peaked at ca . 10,000 individual in ca . 160 day occupying S-cm length of stolen . Thereafter , heavily infested region of stolon started to die , leading to the formation of longitudinal split in their epidermis . In other axil , nematode did not migrate into the stolon but remained confined to axil . Some of these population increased a hundred-fold in 95 day , with population growth ending when petiole started to die . Host plant stolen morphology wa affected only when subepidermal stolen population developed high population level ( > 100 nematode ) within close proximity ( < 2 cm ) to active terminal meristem . This occurred either when axillary bud became active on previously infested node or when nematode established endoparasitic population at location near the stolen tip during winter and spring , when the rate of stolen extension wa limited by low light intensity . Affected stolen tip could ''escape '' from the influence of such infestation when light intensity and temperature increased . Nematode activity wa limited by low temperature rather than light intensity . Global warming is likely to lead to greater damage to infested plant during the winter and early spring because the predicted milder winter temperature will enhance nematode activity but not necessarily promote stolen growth .

aVThis paper considers ecosystem evaluation under condition of climate change in the context both of the U.S. Water Resources Council 's Principles and Guidelines ( P & G ) and the more general Federal regulation governing environmental evaluation . Federal water agency have responsibility for protecting aquatic ecosystem through their regulatory program and operation and planning mission . The primary concern of water resource and aquatic ecosystem planning in the United States is on the riparian or floodplain corridor of river system . In the context of climate change , planning for these system focus on adaptation option both for current climate variability and for that engendered by potential climate change . Ecosystems appear to be highly vulnerable to climate change , a described in IPCC report . Aquatic ecosystem are likely to be doubly affected , first by thermally induced change of global warming and second by change in the hydrologic regime . Perhaps a much a any of the issue dealt with in this issue , the evaluation of ecosystem is linked to fundamental question of criterion a well a to the detail of the Federal environmental planning system . That system is a densely woven , interlocking system of environmental protection legislation , criterion and regulation that includes a self-contained evaluation system driven by the National Environmental Policy Act ( NEPA ) procedural guideline ( United States Council on Environmental Quality , 1978 ) and Environmental Impact Statement ( EIS ) requirement . The Corps of Engineers must use both the P & G and the NEPA/EIS system in discharging it responsibility . If U.S. Federal agency are to take the lead in formulating and evaluating adaptation option , there need to be a reexamination of existing evaluation approach . Among the element of the P & G that may require rethinking in view of the prospect of global climate change are those relating to risk and uncertainty , nonstationarity , interest rate , and multiple objective . Within the government planning process , effort must be made to resolve inconsistency and constraint in order to permit the optimal evaluation of water-based ecosystem under global climate change . The interrelationship of the two system are described in this paper , and alternative way of viewing the planning process are discussed . Strategic planning and management at the watershed level provides an effective approach to many of the issue . Current NEPA/EIS impact analysis doe not provide a suitable framework for environmental impact analysis under climate uncertainty , and site-specific water resource evaluation relating to climate change appears difficult at current level of knowledge about climate change . The IPCC Technical Guidelines , however , provide a useful beginning for assessing the impact of future climate state .

aVRural Amazonians , especially Indians , extractivists and other forest dweller , desperately need something that they can sell . Sale of material commodity taken from the rainforest is the focus of most attempt to encourage 'sustainable development ' for these population , but the mother lode waiting to be tapped is not a material commodity , but rather the forest 's environmental service . Converting service like biodiversity maintenance , carbon storage and water cycling into monetary flow that can support a population of forest guardian requires crossing a series of hurdle . Reliable quantification of the magnitude of service being offered is a first necessity . How to convert forest environmental service into an income stream , and how to convert this stream into a foundation for sustainable development in rural Amazonia is a great challenge . Effort should be focused on tapping environmental service a a long-term strategy for maintaining both rainforest and it population . In addition to progressing toward long-term goal , immediate measure are needed to support the population and to avoid further loss of forest .

aVWe investigated the potential effect of global climate change on arctic tundra vegetation used a caribou forage . A total of 96 experimental plot wa established at six site on the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge , Alaska , in 1993 and 1994 . We erected snow-fences to increase the amount of snow deposition , and therefore delay the date of the snowmelt on 48 plot ( referred to a increased snow/late melting plot ) . We used black mesh netting on the surface of the snow to increase the rate of melting on 24 plot ; the remaining 24 plot served a control . In July 1994 , we collected green leaf from Eriophorum vaginatum , Salix planifolia , and Betula nana and analysed these sample for total carbon and total nitrogen content . Ratios of carbon to nitrogen differed among treatment for all three specie . Generally C : N ratio for B. nana and E. vaginatum on increased snow/late melting plot were lower than on control plot . C : N ratio for S. planifolia on increased snow/late melting plot did not differ from control , but were lower than on plot which started to melt early . These result may be due to the timing of nitrogen translocation from leaf and stem tissue into storage organ , or due to an increase in available nitrogen input to the system . Further sampling is needed to adequately determine the mechanism responsible for increased nitrogen content of caribou forage in area with increased amount of snow and delayed snowmelt .

aVThe Russian Federation contains approximately 20 % of the world 's timber resource and more than half of all boreal forest . These forest play a prominent role in environmental protection and economic development at global , national , and local level , a well a , provide commodity for indigenous people and habitat for a variety of plant and animal specie . The response and feedback of Russian boreal forest to projected global climate change are expected to be profound . Large shift in the distribution ( up to 19 % area reduction ) and productivity of boreal forest are implied by scenario of General Circulation Models ( GCMs ) , Uncertainty regarding the potential distribution and productivity of future boreal forest complicates the development of adaptation strategy for forest establishment , management , harvesting and wood processing . Although a low potential exists for rapid natural adaptation of long lived , complex boreal forest , recent analysis suggest Russian forest management and utilization strategy should be field tested to ass their potential to assist boreal forest in adaptation to a changing global environment . Current understanding of the vulnerability of Russian forest resource to projected climate change is discussed and example of possible adaptation measure for Russian forest are presented , including : ( 1 ) artificial forestation technique that can be applied with the advent of failed natural regeneration and to facilitate forest migration northward ; ( 2 ) silvicultural measure that can influence the specie mix to maintain productivity under future climate ; ( 3 ) identifying forest at risk and developing special management adaptation measure for them ; ( 4 ) alternative processing and us of wood and non-wood product from future forest ; and ( 5 ) potential future infrastructure and transport system that can be employed a boreal forest shift northward into melting permafrost zone . Current infrastructure and technology can be employed to help Russian boreal forest adapt to projected global environmental change , however many current forest management practice may have to be modified . Application of this technical knowledge can help policymakers identify priority for climate change adaptation .

aVIt is widely assumed that the more certain and precise the scientific knowledge-base for predicting and understanding climate change , the better defined and robust will be the policy measure undertaken in response . In this paper we argue to the contrary that in the case of Global Warming Potentials ( GWPs ) ambiguity in their precise meaning is a major reason why they have been developed and continue a scientific policy tool [ although this is not how they are commonly represented in the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) ] . We survey and analyse the range of opinion on GWPs with respect to their scientific stability and comprehensiveness and argue that the utility of GWPs ha to be evaluated in term of their symbolic , interactional and heuristic effect a well a with respect to their direct instrumental us . In addition , we argue that scientific discussion of GWPs commonly incorporates element of the social and policy context of their application and provide several example from detailed discussion at the IPCC . We endeavour to account for the ambiguous identity of GWPs and draw out several implication from the finding of the paper for the construction and use of scientific tool in policy .

aVThe radiation climate a one essential factor influencing phytoplankton primary production will likely change in near future due to the increase of UV-A/B radiation and to stronger vertical mixing . The emission of dimethylsulphide ( DMS ) from dimethylsulphonium propionate ( DMSP ) influence the radiation climate due to it impact on cloud formation The diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum had a high acclimation ability to radiation stress resulting in a rapid recovery from stress induced loss in photosynthetic efficiency . In this case the primary production wa not strongly impaired , and UV-B impaired photosynthesis by a mechanism different from that under excess PAR . The DMSP content of Prymnesium parvum wa independent of irradiance and nitrogen supply . Total DMSP production of Prymnesium , however , wa closely related to the age of the cell which wa reduced under high irradiance .

aVSix air issue are currently on science and policy agenda in Canada and elsewhere . These are climate change , stratospheric ozone depletion ( increased UV-B radiation ) , acidic deposition , SMOG ( increased ground-level ozone ) , suspended particulate matter , and hazardous air pollutant . Atmospheric scientist and decision maker have largely addressed these issue individually resulting in single-issue policy . However , it is now recognized that these issue are inter-related , and they may interact to cause negative a well a some beneficial effect , not only on the state of the atmosphere but also on societal and ecological system . This paper illustrates through several example the atmospheric dysfunction caused by the linkage among the six air issue . It also point to potentially conflicting policy arising from the single-issue approach , and it emphasizes the need for better integration of air issue . The linkage are summarized qualitatively in Table I .

aVWood waste is a potential source of methane production due to it high degradable organic carbon content and an on-site storage method that is conducive to development of anaerobic condition . Future emission from wood waste could be even higher if waste pile must be converted to landfill by soil capping in order to comply with national criterion for solid waste disposal . In order to estimate current and potential methane emission rate a set of field and laboratory measurement were undertaken . Gas sample for analysis of methane and CO2 were collected from the surface of sawdust pile using chamber placed on the pile surface , and at depth of 1.5 , 3.0 and 4.6 m using a sampling probe . Two pile in each of the following age range were sampled : 0-1 , 1-4 , 3-5 , and 5-8 year . In the laboratory study , sawdust sample from the 3.0 m depth were incubated under 20 % CO2 in nitrogen at 32 , 40 and 48 degree C to simulate the temperature range and anaerobic condition occurring in typical sawdust pile . Field measurement indicated that methane comprised 20 % of the biogas generated from sawdust pile . Emissions from the pile surface averaged 1.68 mg m ( -2 ) h ( -1 ) compared to literature estimate from landfill on the order of 0.125-125,000 mg m ( -2 ) h ( -1 ) ( Bogner and Scott , 1995 ) , with the low emission rate suggesting that a large percentage of the methane produced wa either oxidized or otherwise consumed before reaching the pile surface . Emissions to the atmosphere estimated from annual sawdust production in the Tennessee Valley range from 15-44 metric ton per year incubation study indicated highest methane generation at 32 degree C with a reduction in emission in excess of 70 % when the temperature wa increased to 48 degree C. Estimates of methane production indicate that soil capping of disposed sawdust could increase methane production by 2-2.5 time over the biodegradation lifetime of the sawdust stored on-site . Assuming the global warming potential of methane is 21 time that of CO2 , combustion of wood waste rather than on-site storage or capping would provide a CO2 offset of 1.2 or 3.8 ton , respectively , for each toll of sawdust burned .

aVThis paper is concerned with nonmarket valuation in the context of global warming . First , concerning the impact of global warming : what are the prospect for the inclusion of nonmarket value in estimate of the damage of warming ? The second question relates to the role of the Principles and Guidelines a the supporting document for water resource project . Are tool for nonmarket valuation , a found in the Principles and Guidelines satisfactory for water resource project evaluation with a changing climate ? The potential effect of climate change are so numerous and subtle that it would be prohibitively costly to measure them all . Thus a comprehensive program for including nonmarket damage a part of the cost of global warming seems ill-advised . Where specific concern arise , researcher may learn from small scale study . Many of the damage of global warming are diminished by the ability of human to adapt at small cost , especially the nonuse component of nonmarket value . When the question concern minor water resource project , the gain from including extra effect induced by global warming seem to be small compared with the cost . The Principles and Guidelines doe not reflect current practice in benefit estimation . However , it is not clear that this is a serious problem , because most practitioner continue to revise their understanding of valuation method . If the Principles and Guidelines were to be revised , it would make sense to provide more current guideline for all of the behavioral model and contingent valuation . Revisions of the Principles and Guidelines should not do anything special for anthropocentrically induced climate change .

aVFertilization of the ocean with nutrient such a nitrate and phosphate is one of the countermeasure against the global warming problem . In the present paper , we evaluated the effective ratio of the nutrient sprinkling into the ocean to the nutrient assimilation by phytoplankton . When the nutrient equivalent to the 1/500 of the annual accumulated amount of CO2 in the atmosphere were sprinkled within the circle of 7.1 - 100 km radius by a ship , le than 0.01 % of the nutrient wa found to be transferred to the deep ocean without assimilation . The rest remained in surface ocean , most of which wa found to be incorporated in the phytoplankton within one year . We also evaluated the energy balance of transportation of the fertilizer by ship to that taken up by the fertilization in ocean , The energy evaluation indicated that the amount of CO2 produced from the transportation process wa about 0.23 % of the amount that is expected to be taken up into the ocean from the atmosphere . Furthermore , we estimated the energy balance of fertilization with activated sludge instead of fertilizer . It wa found that fertilization by activated sludge containing a great deal of water needed a large amount of energy for the transportation by ship . ( C ) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd .

aVIn order to determine the effect of high temperature on ovule development and reproductive process subsequent to pollen production , nine day/night temperature combination were imposed over a 9 month period a four separate experiment , each with three treatment , including one common treatment . In order to eliminate known effect of high temperature on pollen production and stylar position , high temperature treatment were applied only to male-sterile tomato ( Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. ) . Pollen wa obtained from male-fertile plant given optimal growth condition . This allowed comparison of mean daily temperature from 25-29 degree C ; day/night temperature differential ( DIFs ) of 2 , 6 , and 10 degree C ; day temperature of 28 , 30 and 32 degree C at night temperature of 22 , 24 , and 26 degree C ; and night temperature of 22 , 24 and 26 degree C at day temperature of 28 , 30 and 32 degree C. Average weight per fruit and flower number did not demonstrate a consistent pattern of response to high temperature . Other reproductive characteristic ( % fruitset , total number and weight of fruit per plant , and seediness index ) decreased a mean daily temperature rose from 25 degree C to 26 degree C and from 28 degree C to 29 degree C. The primary parameter affecting these variable wa mean daily temperature , with day temperature having a secondary role . thus , in determining reproductive response of tomato to temperature within this range , day temperature , night temperature and DIFs do not need to be considered independently of their effect on mean daily temperature . If this relationship hold true in other specie , and for pre-pollen production process a well , modelling the effect of projected climate change should be simplified .

aVRussian agriculture sensitivity to change in climate , soil and atmosphere chemistry were analyzed . Calculated data are presented on crop productivity of grain crop and grass ( C-3 ) under arid and humid scenario of climate taking account of one- , two- , three and four-factor natural environment impact . All four factor under study ( climatic parameter , CO2 and tropospheric ozone concentration , soil degradation extent ) greatly impact agriculture productivity . The effect of interaction between all considered factor on agroecosystem productivity is studied . it is established that a simple additive scheme for explaining the complex effect of some factor can be much violated . In this case , not only variation in the mean crop yield level but also variation in the degree of crop stability have been assessed in some region , that may be more important for determining the social-economic consequence . It turned out that the recurrence of critically very low yield in steppe region may increase two fold a a result of global warming .

aVA structurally highly simplified globally integrated coupled climate-economic cost model SIAM ( Structural Integrated Assessment Model ) is used to compute optimal path of global CO2 emission that minimize the net sum of climate damage and mitigation cost . The model is used to study the sensitivity of the computed optimal emission path with respect to various critical input assumption . The climate module is represented by a linearized impulse-response model calibrated against a coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation climate model and a three-dimensional global carbon-cycle model . The cost term are represented by strongly simplified expression designed for maximal transparency with respect to sensitive input assumption . These include the discount rate for mitigation and damage cost , the inertia of the socio-economic system , and the dependence of climate damage on the change in temperature and the rate of change of temperature . Different assumption regarding these parameter are believed to be the cause of the marked divergence of existing cost-benefit analysis based on more sophisticated economic model . The long memory of the climate system implies that very long time horizon of several hundred year need to be considered to optimize CO2 emission on time scale relevant for a policy of sustainable development . Cost-benefit analysis over shorter time scale of a century or two can lead to dangerous underestimate of the long term climatic impact of increasing greenhouse-gas emission . To avert a major long term global warming , CO2 emission need to be reduced ultimately to very low level . However , the draw-down can be realized a a gradual transition process over many decade and even century . This should nevertheless not be interpreted a providing a time cushion for inaction : the transition becomes more costly the longer the necessary mitigation policy are delayed . However , the long time horizon provides adequate flexibility for later adjustment . Short term energy conservation alone is insufficient and can be viewed only a a useful measure in support of the necessary long term transition to carbon-free energy technology . For standard climate damage cost expression , optimal emission path limiting long term global warming to acceptable sustainable development level are recovered only if climate damage cost are not significantly discounted . Discounting of climate damage at normal economic rate yield emission path that are only weakly reduced relative to business a usual scenario , resulting in high global warming level that are incompatible with the generally accepted requirement of sustainable development . The solution are nevertheless logically consistent with the underlying discounting assumption , namely that the occurrence of global warming damage in the distant future a a result of present human activity is of negligible concern today . It follows that a commitment to long term sustainable development , if it in fact exists , should be expressed by an intertemporal relation for the value of the earth 's future climate which doe not degrade significantly over the time horizon relevant for climate change . Since the future climate is a common assett whose value can not be determined on the market , the appropriate discount rate for future climate damage should be determined by an assessment of the public willingness to pay today for the mitigation of future climate change . To translate our general conclusion into quantitative cost estimate required by decision maker , the present exploratory study need to be extended using more detailed disaggregated climate damage and mitigation cast estimate and more realistic socioeconomic model , including multi-actor interaction , inherent variability , the role of uncertainty and adaptive control strategy .

aVStored amount and flow rate of soil carbon were measured simultaneously with soil environmental condition ( temperature and moisture content ) periodically during the growing season from 1994 to 1995 at two plot ( plot A wa a dry soil condition , and plot B wa a wet condition ) in a black spruce ( Picea mariana ) forest stand in the Prince Albert area of Saskatchewan , Canada . Seasonal trend in litterfall rate and accumulation of the A ( 0 ) layer were not observed , while the total and mineral soil respiration rate changed seasonally with soil temperature . There wa no significant relationship between soil moisture content and-any how rate or accumulation of soil carbon . Soil respiration and loss of litter might have been very low during the winter ( November to early May ) because of the frozen soil . The annual soil carbon cycling wa analyzed by a compartment model , based on the data obtained in this study . The relative decomposition rate of the A ( 0 ) layer and humus in the mineral soil were estimated at 0.0632 yr ( -1 ) and 0.0045 for plot A and 0.0284 yr ( -1 ) and 0.0020 for plot B , respectively . These value indicate that the soil carbon cycling in plot A wa about twice a fast a that in plot B . The slower cycling in plot B may be caused by the lower soil temperature and humid soil condition , since the groundwater level is higher in plot B . The soil in both plot were accumulating carbon , i.e. , 0.13 t C ha ( -1 ) yr ( -1 ) for plot A and 0.03 for plot B . The soil carbon cycling in the boreal forest stand wa slower because of the lower soil temperature than that reported in the cool- and warm-temperate forest . Soil carbon cycling in the boreal forest predominantly occurred at the surface of the mineral soil , suggesting that the decomposition response of soil organic matter in the boreal forest will be enhanced compared to other climate zone forest because of the large predicted temperature increase in the boreal zone under global warming .

aVAs an ecological boundary zone , the forest-tundra ecotone is a valuable location to study the initial response of vegetation to global climate change . The purpose of this study is to predict the potential response of the forest-tundra ecotone in Rocky Mountain National Park to future climate change using data on historical episode of establishment in patch forest opening of the forest-tundra ecotone . We hypothesized that recent seedling establishment in patch forest opening of the forest-tundra ecotone , not balanced by mortality , wa triggered by a warm , but wet period following the end of the Little Ice Age ca . A.D. 1850 . At four sampling location distributed throughout the Park , we determined date of establishment among patch forest tree using increment core and basal disk . We studied the relationship between establishment date in relation to historical climate record using t-tests and logistic regression . In Rocky Mountian National Park , tree invasion in patch forest opening is episodic in nature , concentrated between 1951-1964 , and is not balanced by mortality , suggesting more than a short-term change in the ecotone . On the basis of the climate record , t-tests , and logistic model , we concluded that both high temperature and high snow depth must occur simultaneously for several year in order to generate climatic condition suitable for tree establishment . The historic climate record indicates that a warmer and wetter period occurred during the 1950s and 1960s , but climate data are unavailable before 1880 . According to proxy climate record , it appears that the regional climate of the southern Rocky Mountain region ha been both warmer and wetter since the end of the Little Ice Age ( ca . A.D. 1350-1850 ) . We conclude that these climatic condition may be related to the tree invasion we observed in patch forest opening of Rocky Mountain National Park .

aVHydrologic trend , real ( physical ) or perceived ( statistical ) , suggest that water management be predicated on the assumption of hydrologic nonstationarity . The assumption leaf open the question to what extent will the ''trends '' be sustained locally and regionally over the future 25 , 50 or 100 year corresponding to the economic time horizon of water project . Whether hydrologic trend are real or perceived , record event of hydrologic extreme , flood and drought , will be broken with exceedingly high probability over the economic life of water project . Before the assumption of hydrologic nonstationarity is accepted , the ability to cope with the uncertain impact of global warming on water management via the operational assumption of hydrologic stationarity should be carefully examined . In the absence of strong physical evidence , trend can not be unequivocally distinguished from slow oscillation . Slow oscillation can be mimicked by persistence in stationary process . It is time to examine the relative merit of the assumption of stationarity and nonstationarity in the operational context of water management . The strategy of wait-and-see , i.e . delaying the making of important , expensive and essentially irreversible capital investment , could served water manager well in coping with the uncertainty regarding climate change .

aVThe deadly heat wave of July 1995 that affected much of the U.S. midwest , most notably Chicago , Illinois , ha been put into historical perspective . The heat wave ha been found to be remarkably unusual , but only partially because of the extreme high apparent temperature ( an index of the combined effect of temperature and humidity on human ) , when the author calculate a return period of the peak apparent temperature of le than or equal to 23 yr. Of greater significance were the very high temperature that persisted day and night over an extended 48-h period . Analysis presented here indicates that for Chicago such an extended period of continuously high day and night apparent temperature is unprecedented in modem time . The 2-day period where the minimum apparent temperature failed to go below 31.5 degree C ( 89 degree F ) is calculated to be an extremely rare event ( probability of occurrence < 0.1 % ) based on a 10 000-yr-long simulation of a four-parameter ( temperature related to the mean , the intraseasonal daily variance , the interannual variance , and the day-to-day persistence of temperature ) probabilistic model . Such unusual heat wave evoke question related to the future course of the climate and whether this recent event wa merely an extreme anomaly or part of an ongoing trend toward more extreme heat wave . A Monte Carlo analysis of trend ( 1948-95 ) for various quantiles of the hourly apparent temperature during the most severe heat wave each year from 26 midwestern station reveals a modest , statistically insignificant increase of apparent temperature for a wide range of quantiles without the inclusion of 1995 data . There is a statistically significant increase in apparent temperature with it inclusion , reflected most strongly for upper quantiles or daytime temperature . It is argued , however , that because of the impact of change in instrumentation at primary National Weather Service station , the potential affect of urbanization , and little trend of summer mean temperature , it is unlikely that the macroscale climate of heat wave in the Midwest or in Chicago is changing in any significant manner . Trends notwithstanding , the author demonstrate the difficulty associated with projecting change in the frequency and severity of similar type of event , even if the mean apparent temperature could be accurately predicted for the next century , for example , global warming projection . This is demonstrated using Chicago temperature . The author show that accurate projection of the frequency , severity , and duration of heat wave in the Midwest require accurate projection not only of the mean , the interannual variance , the intraseasonal variance , and day-to-day persistence , but also the interrelationship among these quantity within different synoptic-climatic regime .

aVSedimentary habitat cover most of the ocean bottom and therefore constitute the largest . single ecosystem on earth in spatial coverage , Although only a small fraction of the micro- , meio- and macroscopic benthic organism that reside in and on sediment have been described and few estimate of total specie number and biogeographic pattern have been attempted , there is sufficient information on a few specie to suggest that sedimentary organism significantly impact major ecological process . Benthic organism contribute to regulation of carbon , nitrogen , and sulfur cycling , water column process , pollutant distribution and fate , secondary production , and transport , and stability of sediment . Linkages between group of organism and the level of functional redundancy is poorly known , however , there is probably substantial redundancy within group . There is little evidence that biodiversity per se is necessary for benthic system to contribute to ecosystem service . but because linkage are so poorly known and predictive knowledge confined to a few specie , it is not presently possible to predict exactly how specie loss will impact these service and ecosystem health . Thus , a precautionary approach of `` assume the worst '' is advised , and every effort should be made to curtail the specie and genetic diversity loss resulting from fishing , pollution , habitat destruction , introduction of non-native ( exotic ) specie , and global warming . Concurrently , scientist must take advantage of exciting , rapidly evolving technology and a rejuvenated interest in biodiversity to provide more concrete and thorough information on benthos and ecosystem process .

aVWith recent prediction for global climate warming , the question arises a to how change in temperature influence the dynamic of population in natural community . We investigated the effect of temperature ( 18 and 25 degree C ) on the stability of a common freshwater predator-prey system consisting of Daphnia pulex and phytoplankton in different type of mesocosm community . The plant-herbivore dynamic were examined in the presence and absence of the predator Mesostoma ehrenbergii to simulate food chain of two or three trophic level , and in the presence or absence of competing zooplankton . The predator-prey system wa destabilized at the higher temperature in all type of community , and D. pulex extinction always occurred . This result wa unaffected by simplification of the community but wa enhanced by the addition of the carnivore . Mechanisms are proposed for the observed result including ( i ) the direct effect of temperature on vital rate parameter describing the D. pulex - algal interaction and ( ii ) a shift in algal community structure to le edible specie following suppression by the herbivore at the higher temperature . Some implication of temperature increase expected under current global warming scenario in pond system are discussed .

aVRecently , there is increasing concern in Kuwait regarding the frequent occurrence of harsh climate condition with summer air temperature exceeding the 50 degree C mark . In particular , in the last 20 year , the maximum yearly temperature is persistently exceeding it mean value for the whole recorded period . In an effort to explain this phenomenon , a study wa made on the surface air temperature record for the past three decade measured at Kuwait International Airport and at a nearby coastal station at Ras Al-Khafja . The analysis have demonstrated that the airport weather station is more influenced by urbanization than Ras Al-Khafja . The linear trend of the air temperature data for both station consistently showed a cooling period until 1972 , followed by a warming period with temperature increase in the range of 0.03-0.08 degree C yr ( -1 ) . This warming trend is believed to be partly due to global climate change and the rest is due to man-induced local change in climate caused by urbanization . The urban warming appears to be both a daytime and nighttime phenomenon , with maximum ? mean and minimum temperature showing a considerable increase . It is estimated that urban warming account for 25 % of the maximum temperature increase . ( C ) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd .

aVSimulations are presented of the change in the spectrum of the clear-sky outgoing long-wave radiation ( OLR ) associated with the global warming produced by increase in greenhouse-gas concentration . The input data for the present day and for the middle of the next century were taken from a recent climate-prediction run of the Hadley Centre Climate Model . The simulation focus on the spectral signature of the warming a opposed to that of the forcing . Stratospheric cooling cause decrease of the OLR in the carbon-dioxide and ozone band , whilst surface warming increase the OLR in the region of the atmospheric window . The signal in the water-vapour band is more subtle , due to a near cancellation between the effect of change in atmospheric temperature and specific humidity that have little impact on the relative humidity . The residual signal is shown to be related to small change in upper-tropospheric relative humidity , although at some latitude this relationship break down . It is suggested that satellite observation in the water-vapour band could be used to provide a quantitative measure of the water-vapour feedback during global warming .

aVThis paper report analytical relation for the thermodynamic property enthalpy , entropy , heat capacity at constant pressure and temperature of the replacement refrigerant R-123 and R-134a . These refrigerant are considered promising a substitute for the fluid R-ll and R-12 , respectively , which are two of the most widely used CFC refrigerant . In addition to the property , the three real gas isentropic exponent k ( p , v ) , k ( v , T ) , k ( p , T ) are calculated , which may be used instead of the classical exponent k = c ( p ) /c ( v ) , in the ideal gas isentropic change equation to describe with good accuracy the real gas behaviour . A systematic study to research the influence of various parameter on heat transfer during condensation of R-123 and R-134a on horizontal integral-fin tube is also carried out . The result are useful in refrigeration application to improve the basic design , a a significant concern about new refrigerant to replace the CFCs ha increased very rapidly due to the destruction of stratospheric ozone and global warming .

aVThe evolution of the amplitude of annual variation ( AAV ) in the surface air temperature and temperature of different tropospheric and lower stratospheric layer is estimated in the presence of global change in the earth climate system . The estimate are based on different monthly mean and seasonal mean temperature data over recent decade ( from greater than three decade to 140 year ) and are obtained for different latitude range and the entire Northern and Southern hemisphere , including separate estimate over the land and the ocean . A general decrease in the AAV of surface air temperature over the land , especially in the middle and high latitude , is observed simultaneously with global warming from data over greater than 100 recent year . However , opposite tendency occur over the land and certain oceanic region . During the past few decade , a general decrease in lower stratosphere temperature with a statistically significant increase in amplitude of annual variation in the high latitude ha corresponded to a general increase in the surface air temperature . Along with a qualitative analysis of interconnection between the revealed trend and different climatic mechanism , they are compared with output of climatic model , including general circulation model . In connection with the revealed evolution of annual temperature variation , a general tendency of decreasing the amplitude of quasi-biennial temperature oscillation in the troposphere and an opposite tendency in the stratosphere , both with simultaneous global warming , can be expected .

aVThe primary objective of this paper is to explain current U.S. policy on global climate change . U.S. Department of Energy ( DOE ) effort to implement this policy will be described . A secondary objective of this paper is to discus from a U.S. perspective the social and political effort which must be initiated in order for ocean storage of CO2 to be considered a a viable CO2 mitigation option . The fact that the Framework Convention on Climate Change ( FCCC ) ha not been successful in reducing greenhouse gas emission is now recognized . Thus , U.S. policy ha shifted towards the development of binding medium-term emission target and long-term atmosphere concentration goal . The U.S. belief these goal can be accomplished through the adoption of cost-effective joint implementation agreement and international emission trading mechanism . Studies are currently underway to ass specific target and timetable for emission reduction . Voluntary effort on the part of U.S. industry have proven to be extremely successful in reducing U.S. CO2 emission . The U.S. electric utility industry ha taken the lead in voluntarily lowering greenhouse gas emission under the DOE Climate Challenge Program . As of August , 1996 , nearly 600 utility participant , accounting for over 60 % of electric power generation in the U.S. , have joined the program . Areas of research interest to DOE include the development of high efficiency advanced power generation cycle and CO2 sequestration technology . The U.S. currently spends $ 1.6 billion on understanding global climate phenomenon and only $ 1.6 million on CO2 mitigation research . A number of socio-political consideration must be looked at in assessing the feasibility of ocean storage of CO2 . Developing public trust appears to be a major concern in establishing the acceptability of ocean storage . Uncertainties in the effect of CO2 on marine life , potential safety hazard associated with pipelining , and ship transport of CO2 are all issue which must be dealt with a soon a possible . Some hidden cost associated with ocean disposal will also be discussed . ( C ) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All right reserved .

aVA new approach is proposed for the evaluation of vegetation equilibrium response to global warming . The approach considers the dependence of the position of biome boundary a significantly multi-valued function of climatic condition ; the reason for the multiplicity may be partly due to capacity of vegetation to change it environment . This result in hysteresis manifestation ( threshold and irreversibility effect ) in response to climate change . Matthews ' global vegetation data set and IIASA climatic data base were used to reconstruct the domain of different biome in a space of climatic factor ( biotemperature and average precipitation ) . Based on the overlap of these domain , the map of biome ' potential extent are calculated for present climate and for two scenario of global warming ( GISS and GFDL ) . These result imply a significant role for hysteresis phenomenon in the global vegetation pattern . Maps of vegetation change under two climate scenario calculated with the help of a new algorithm to account for hysteresis indicate much le change than equivalent map obtained by other equilibrium approach under the two climate change scenario . Changes are predicted for 20 % of terrestrial area . A relatively small increase of forest and decrease of nonforest vegetation area predicted by both scenario .

aVThe reality of the decreasing global irradiation of more than 0.5 Watt per m ( 2 ) annually since the early 50 at the one hand and the augmenting of the green house forcing at the other hand contradict the existing model and the forcasts on global warming . The question regarding the cause of the remarkable decrease of the global irradiation still ha to be answered ! Two hypothetical attempt for an explanation - additional reflexion and/or absorption of solar irradiation in the atmosphere - are in discussion . The cause have to be sought in the atmosphere of the earth and by the human activity since the 50 . Concluding may be stated that at present there are two opposite climatological process on the way . The decreasing global irradiation contra the augmentation of the green house forcing . Still it ha to be remembered that an increasing green house forcing depends fundamentaly on the amount of the global irradiation . An increasing green house forcing can surely only compensate for a restricted time scale a decrease of the global irradiation . It seems a very alarming vision that the human activity mainly since the 50 cause a global cooling up from the time space when the green house forcing can not compensate the decrease of the global irradiation anymore . & nbsp ; In the future modeler and forecaster of climate change must consequently attache more importance to the reality of the wide-spread decrease of the global irradiation over the whole atmosphere presumable caused by aerosol and cloud in releation to the augmenting climate forcings caused by increasing concentration of green house gas in the atmosphere. & nbsp ;

aVTo estimate the potential consequence of projected global warming on streamflow , a deterministic model for a monthly timescale ha been developed . The model structure is based on the water budget theory and contains deterministic relationship to estimate four component of streamflow : direct runoff , interflow , base flow , and snowmelt . The model input are six climate variable for each time step and 10 watershed parameter . The model ha four calibration parameter which are related to direct runoff and snowmelt runoff . The model ha been applied to the Little Washita River watershed in Oklahoma and the Baptism River watershed in Minnesota . The former is an agricultural watershed with a warm and seasonally dry climate , and the latter is a forested watershed with a cool and humid climate . The model simulates mean monthly streamflow in the Baptism River with a Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient ( NSC ) of 0.99 and a correlation coefficient of 0.83 . For the Little Washita River the same simulation measure are 0.94 and 0.89 , respectively .

aVThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) estimated that the global mean surface air temperature will increase about 2 degree C above the 1990 level by 2100 . Such an increase in temperature may result in an increase in the number of generation per year of most insect . Several simulation model have been constructed to predict the increase in the number of generation , but these require a great deal of calculation to obtain estimate for many insect specie at various location under various scenario of global warming . This paper proposes an analytical method to enable a quick estimation . Two assumption are used : ( 1 ) The developmental rate of insect is approximately given by a linear function of temperature ( T ) , with a developmental zero ( T ( 0 ) ) and a thermal constant ( K ) . ( 2 ) The increase in temperature is approximately even throughout the year . Let m be the current annual mean temperature at a given location , and Delta T the potential increase in temperature under global warming at the location . If the temperature before the Delta T-rise is higher than T ( 0 ) in summer and lower than ( T ( 0 ) -Delta T ) in winter , the increase in the number of generation per year , which is denoted by Delta N , is approximately given by Delta N approximate to Delta T [ c + d ( m - T ( 0 ) ) ] /K , where c and d are constant . The validity of the approximation is checked using the `` smoothed daily normal '' in Japan obtained a a running mean of 15 successive daily normal where a daily normal is defined a the averaged daily temperature for 30 year from 1960 to 1990 . The estimate are c=204.4 and d=12.46 . Using this formula , linear isoclines of Delta N are plotted in a graph of T ( 0 ) versus K. By plotting the T ( 0 ) and K of various insect in this graph , we can estimate the increase in the number of generation under global warming in temperate zone .

aVWe examined the response of montane butterfly to a 1300-m elevational gradient in the Toiyabe Range , a mountain range in the central Great Basin . We tested whether elevational range of montane butterfly conform to Rapoport 's elevational rule ( specie at higher elevation have greater elevational range ) . We also tested whether the Rapoport-rescue hypothesis ( emigrant from higher elevation population inflate the specie richness of lower-elevation site ) could explain the specie richness pattern we observed . In addition , we predicted whether global climate change is likely to perturb current elevational gradient in butterfly specie richness . Species presence data were collected from 105 100-m vertical elevational band in 17 canyon . Elevation and specie richness were significantly negatively correlated , although specie richness peaked at intermediate elevation , and butterfly in species-rich area had significantly narrower elevational range than specie in more depauperate area . Toiyabe Range butterfly conformed to Rapoport 's elevational rule . The Rapoport effect we documented did not result from sampling bias . However , the Rapoport-rescue hypothesis can not fully explain the elevational gradient in specie richness . Environmental severity at either end and favorable condition near the middle of the elevational gradient likely contributed to high specie richness at intermediate elevation . Our model indicated that few butterfly taxon will be lost from the Toiyabe Range in the face of climate change . To maintain present specie richness and maximize the potential of Great Basin butterfly to adapt to rapid climate change , we recommend that habitat protection and restoration effort target not only high elevation Wilderness Areas but also intermediate elevation .

aVNew estimate of the moistening of the atmosphere through evaporation at the surface and of the drying through precipitation are computed . Overall , the e-folding residence time of atmospheric moisture is just over 8 day . New estimate are also made of how much moisture that precipitate out come from horizontal transport versus local evaporation , referred to a 'recycling ' . The result depend greatly on the scale of the domain under consideration and global map of the recycling for annual mean are produced for 500 km scale for which global recycling is 9.6 % , consisting of 8.9 % over land and 9.9 % over the ocean . Even for 1000 km scale , le than 20 % of the annual precipitation typically come from evaporation within the domain . While average overall atmospheric moisture depletion and restoration must balance , precipitation fall only a small fraction of the time . Thus precipitation rate are also examined . Over the United States , one hour interval with 0.1 mm or more are used to show that the frequency of precipitation range from over 30 % in the Northwest , to about 20 % in the Southeast and le than 4 % just east of the continental divide in winter , and from le than 2 % in California to over 20 % in the Southeast in summer . In midlatitudes precipitation typically fall about 10 % of the time , and so rainfall rate , conditional on when rain is falling , are much larger than evaporation rate . The mismatch in the rate of rainfall versus evaporation imply that precipitating system of all kind feed mostly on the moisture already in the atmosphere . Over North America , much of the precipitation originates from moisture advected from the Gulf of Mexico and subtropical Atlantic or Pacific a day or so earlier . Increases in greenhouse gas in the atmosphere produce global warming through an increase in downwelling infrared radiation , and thus not only increase surface temperature but also enhance the hydrological cycle , a much of the heating at the surface go into evaporating surface moisture . Global temperature increase signify that the water-holding capacity of the atmosphere increase and , together with enhanced evaporation , this mean that the actual atmospheric moisture should increase . It follows that naturally-occurring drought are likely to be exacerbated by enhanced potential evapotranspiration . Further , globally there must be an increase in precipitation to balance the enhanced evaporation but the process by which precipitation is altered locally are not well understood . Observations confirm that atmospheric moisture is increasing in many place , for example at a rate of about 5 % per decade over the United States . Based on the above result , we argue that increased moisture content of the atmosphere therefore favor stronger rainfall or snowfall event , thus increasing risk of flooding , which is a pattern observed to be happening in many part of the world . Moreover , because there is a disparity between the rate of increase of atmospheric moisture and precipitation , there are implied change in the frequency of precipitation and/or efficiency of precipitation ( related to how much moisture is left behind in a storm ) . However , an analysis of linear trend in the frequency of precipitation event for the United States corresponding to threshold of 0.1 and 1 mm/h show that the most notable statistically significant trend are for increase in the southern United States in winter and decrease in the Pacific Northwest from November through January , which may be related to change in atmospheric circulation and storm track associated with El Nino-Southern Oscillation trend . It is suggested that a the physical constraint on precipitation apply only globally , more attention should be paid to rate in both observation and model a well a the frequency of occurrence .

aVCarbon dioxide and methane are important greenhouse gas whose exchange rate between soil and the atmosphere are controlled strongly by soil temperature and moisture . We made a laboratory investigation to quantify the relative importance of soil moisture and temperature on flux of CO ( 2 ) and CH ( 4 ) between forest soil and the atmosphere . Forest floor and mineral soil material were collected from a mixed hardwood forest at the Harvard Forest . Long-Term Ecological Research Site ( MA ) and were incubated in the laboratory under a range of moisture ( air-dry to nearly saturated ) and temperature condition ( 5-25 degree C ) . Carbon dioxide emission increased exponentially with increasing temperature in forest floor material , with emission reduced at the lowest and highest soil moisture content . The forest floor Q ( 10 ) of 2.03 ( from 15-25 degree C ) suggests that CO ( 2 ) emission were controlled primarily by soil biological activity . Forest floor CO ( 2 ) emission were predicted with a multiple polynomial regression model ( r ( 2 ) = 0.88 ) of temperature and moisture , but the fit predicting mineral soil respiration wa weaker ( r ( 2 ) = 0.59 ) . Methane uptake wa controlled strongly by soil moisture , with reduced flux under condition of very low or very high soil moisture content . A multiple polynomial model accurately described CH ( 4 ) uptake by mineral soil material ( r ( 2 ) = 0.81 ) , but only weakly ( r ( 2 ) = 0.45 ) predicted uptake by forest floor material . The mineral soil Q ( 10 ) of 1.11 for CH ( 4 ) uptake indicates that methane uptake is controlled primarily by physical process . Our work suggests that inclusion of both moisture and temperature can improve prediction of soil CO ( 2 ) and CH ( 4 ) exchange between soil and the atmosphere . Additionally , global change model need to consider interaction of temperature and moisture in evaluating effect of global climate change on trace gas flux . ( C ) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

aVA North Carolina reef fish community wa resurveyed with scuba gear to determine if change occurred in community structure after 15 year of intense fishing . Generally , fish important in the recreational and commercial fishery were smaller . and large change occurred in relative abundance and specie composition . Indicative of a warming trend , total specie corn position of fish had become more tropical , and a tropical sponge previously unrecorded at this latitude off the North Carolina coast became common . Two new ( to the area ) family and 29 new specie of tropical fish were recorded . Observations of 28 specie of tropical reef fish increased significantly . No new temperate specie were observed , and the most abundant temperate specie decreased by a factor of 22 . Mean monthly bottom water temperature in winter were 1-6 degree C warmer during the recent study . An increase in fish-cleaning symbiosis wa especially noticeable .

aVPrevious study on ice core analysis and recent in situ measurement have shown that CH ( 4 ) ha increased from about 0.75 to 1.73 mu mol/mol during the past 150 year . Here , we review source and sink estimate and we present global 3D model calculation , showing that the main feature of the global CH ( 4 ) distribution are well represented . The model ha been used to derive the total CH ( 4 ) emission source , being about 600 Tg yr ( -1 ) . Based on published result of isotope measurement the total contribution of fossil fuel related CHI emission ha been estimated to be about 110 Tg yr ( -1 ) . However , the individual coal , natural gas and oil associated CH ( 4 ) emission can not be accurately quantified . In particular natural gas and oil associated emission remain speculative . Since the total anthropogenic CH ( 4 ) source is about 410 Tg yr ( -1 ) ( similar to 70 % of the total source ) and the mean recent atmospheric CH ( 4 ) increase is similar to 20 Tg yr ( -1 ) an anthropogenic source reduction of 5 % could stabilize the atmospheric CH ( 4 ) level . We have calculated the indirect chemical effect of increasing CH ( 4 ) on climate forcing on the basis of global 3D chemistry-transport and radiative transfer calculation . These indicate an enhancement of the direct radiative effect by about 30 % , in agreement with previous work The contribution of CH ( 4 ) ( direct and indirect effect ) to climate forcing during the past 150 year is 0.57 W m ( -2 ) ( direct 0.44 W m ( -2 ) , indirect 0.13 W m ( -2 ) ) . This is about 35 % of the climate forcing by CO ( 2 ) ( 1.6 W m ( -2 ) ) and about 22 % of the forcing by all long-lived greenhouse gas ( 2.6 W m ( -2 ) ) . Scenario calculation ( IPCC-IS92a ) indicate that the CH ( 4 ) lifetime in the atmosphere increased by about 25-30 % during the past 150 year to a current value of 7.9 year . Future lifetime change are expected to be much smaller , about 6 % , mostly due to the expected increase of tropospheric O ( 3 ) ( -- > OH ) in the tropic . The global mean concentration of CH ( 4 ) may increase to about 2.55 mu mol/mol , it lifetime is expected to increase to 8.4 year in the year 2050 . Further , we have calculated a CH ( 4 ) global warming potential ( GWP ) of 21 ( kgCH ( 4 ) /kgCO ( 2 ) ) over a time horizon of 100 year , in agreement with IPCC ( 1996 ) . Scenario calculation indicate that the importance of the climate forcing by CH ( 4 ) ( including indirect effect ) relative to that of CO ( 2 ) will decrease in future ; currently this is about 35 % , while this is expected to decrease to about 15 % in the year 2050 .

aVThere is no simple explanation for the unusual increase in coral reef bleaching event that have been occurring on a global scale over the last 2 decade . Recent study focusing on this problem reveal that mass bleaching event have a strong periodic component , arising every similar to 3-4 yr in step with the El Nino climatic phenomenon . To explore this possibility further , we examine a simple oceanographic-ecological model designed to simulate the warm and cool phase of the Pacific Ocean cycle and gauge it effect on local coral reef . This allows u to identify cause for localized `` hot spot '' in the ocean , whose high sea surface temperature have disastrous consequence for coral . The underlying wave dynamic of the model lead to chaotic oscillation ( every similar to 3-4 yr ) , which help explain the coexistence of both order and irregularity in the dynamic of mass bleaching . The model make use of a temperature threshold mechanism-a bleaching event is triggered whenever temperature anomaly exceed a critical level . In a variable environment , the threshold mechanism is sensitive to background fluctuation , and their effect are studied by making use of a `` stochastic resonance '' formulation . Global climate change and other trend in external background environmental condition are all shown to strongly influence the distribution of mass coral bleaching event .

aVChanges in solar activity are regularly forwarded a an hypothesis to explain the observed global warming over the last century . The support of such claim is largely statistical , a knowledge of the physical relationship is limited . The statistical evidence is revisited . Changing solar activity is a statistically plausible hypothesis for the observed warming , if short-term natural variability is the only alternative explanation . Compared to the enhanced greenhouse effect , the solar hypothesis loos a substantial part of it plausibility . Reversely , the size and significance of the estimated impact of the enhanced greenhouse effect on the global mean temperature is hardly affected by solar activity .

aVCurrently there are two different view about the cause of the recently observed global warming . These opinion are the widely accepted concept of the influence of greenhouse gas and the notion of the solar impact on the terrestrial climate . Some difficulty arising from a statistical treatment of solar-terrestrial time series are discussed . It is stated that neither of the contrary position relating to the global warming problem are in a position to claim that they posse the only truth . ( C ) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

aVClimate factor influence the transmission of dengue fever , the world 's most widespread vector-borne virus . We examined the potential added risk posed by global climate change on dengue transmission using computer-based simulation analysis to link temperature output from three climate general circulation model ( GCMs ) to a dengue vectorial capacity equation . Our outcome measure , epidemic potential , is the reciprocal of the critical mosquito density threshold of the vectorial capacity equation . An increase in epidemic potential indicates that a smaller number of mosquito can maintain a state of endemicity of disease where dengue virus is introduced . Baseline climate data for comparison are from 1931 to 1980 . Among the three GCMs , the average projected temperature elevation wa 1.16 degree C , expected by the year 2050 . All three GCMs projected a temperature-related increase in potential seasonal transmission in five selected city , a well a an increase in global epidemic potential , with the largest area change occurring in temper ate region . For region already at risk , the aggregate epidemic potential across the three scenario rose on average between 31 and 47 % ( range , 24-74 % ) . If climate change occurs , a many climatologist believe , this will increase the epidemic potential of dengue-carrying mosquito , given viral introduction and susceptible human population . Our risk assessment suggests that increased incidence map first occur in region bordering : endemic zone in latitude or altitude . Endemic location may be at higher risk from hemorrhagic dengue if transmission intensity increase .

aVIn recent year the world ha become more concerned about the global warming problem . The major greenhouse gas-CO2 are produced mainly by the utilization and combustion of fossil fuels-natural gas , oil , and coal . Methanol is a cleaner fuel for the environment than oil and coal . It generates le CO2 , NOx and SOx per unit of thermal energy , and is easier to handle than methane . The direct conversion of methane to methanol is a potential process for methanol production , although it ha not been practiced on a commercial level to date . In the present study , nitrate melt were used a the promoter for the partial oxidation of methane to methanol . The result were compared to the data extracted from the literature using other melt salt . It ha been found that the oxygen-containing product CH3OH formed in nitrate melt , whereas the product obtained in hydroxide , carbonate and chloride were mainly C2H6 and C2H4 . Summarizing the result obtained in our work and the previous study , it wa suggested that the reaction route proceeding to the oxidative coupling or the direct conversion to methanol can be controlled by a suitable choice of molten salt .

aVAboveground net primary production ( NPP ) and surface water chemistry variable were monitored in a lacustrine sedge fen and a bog for four year . There were no significant difference in precipitation , mean growing season annual temperature , and number of growing degree day from 1991 to 1994 . The mean annual water level in the lacustrine sedge fen differed significantly , whereas they were similar in the bog during these four year . We measured 15 surface water variable in the lacustrine sedge fen and the bog , and found that only two correlated significantly with water level fluctuation . In the lacustrine sedge fen , calcium correlated positively ( r ( 2 ) = 0.56 ) and nitrate correlated negatively ( r ( 2 ) = 0.20 ) with water level . In the bog , potassium correlated positively ( r ( 2 ) = 0.88 ) and total dissolved phosphorus correlated negatively ( r ( 2 ) = 0.62 ) with water level . The remaining chemical variable showed no significant correlation with water level fluctuation . Net primary production of the different vegetation stratum appeared to respond to different environmental variable . In the lacustrine sedge fen , graminoid production wa explained to a significant degree by water level ( r ( 2 ) = 0.53 ) , whereas shrub production wa explained to a significant degree by surface water chemistry variable , such a nitrate ( r ( 2 ) = 0.74 ) and total phosphorus ( r ( 2 ) = 0.22 ) . In the bog , temperature wa the only variable that explained moss production to a significant degree ( r ( 2 ) = 0.71 ) , whereas ammonium explained graminoid production ( r ( 2 ) = 0.66 ) and soluble reactive phosphorus explained shrub production to significant degree ( r ( 2 ) = 0.71 ) . There are few direct data on the impact of climatic warming in boreal wetland , although paleoecological and 2xCO ( 2 ) model data have provided some indication of past and possibly future change in vegetation composition , respectively . Our result suggest that the lacustrine sedge fen may succeed to a bog dominated by Sphagnum spp . and Picea mariana , whereas the bog may succeed to an upland-type forest ecosystem .

aVThe environmental impact of nitrogen emission from soil resulting from the use of organic fertilizer , such a manure , are large compared with the corresponding impact of mineral fertilizer . However , soil emission are rarely included in system analysis of waste management strategy . This study examines whether the inclusion of soil emission can affect the environmental ranking of system for managing solid biodegradable waste . Waste management scenario based on incineration , anaerobic digestion and composting , respectively , were compared . The scenario were analysed using the organic waste research ( ORWARE ) simulation model . A simplified model for calculating nitrogen availability and emission wa also constructed . Life-cycle analysis methodology wa used for choosing system boundary and evaluating the result . Global warming , acidification and eutrophication were the impact category considered . The result indicate the vital importance of considering nitrogen emission from soil when comparing biological waste management system with other waste management method , especially with regard to eutrophication effect . Soil emission are also important when comparing the environmental impact of anaerobic digestion and composting system . However , the variation in nitrogen emission from soil is large and depends on the spreading technique used , climate , drainage and soil texture ( C ) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All right reserved .

aVThe effect of water percolation on CH4 emission from rice paddy wa investigated using a lysimeter experiment for 4 year . Water percolation rate of the lysimeters were adjusted to one of three value , about 0 , 5 , or 20 mm day ( -1 ) during the cultivation period of the first 3 year by periodically opening water stopping valve installed at the bottom of the lysimeters . In the 4th year , water wa drained by pump at a rate of 0 , 7.7 , or 25 mm day ( -1 ) respectively . CH4 emission rate significantly decreased with an increase in the percolation rate . Total emission during a cultivation period ranged from 5.7 to 13.8 , 0.6 to 4.8 , and 0.1 to 0.3 g m ( -2 ) in the no- , moderate- , and high-percolation plot , respectively . The decrease in soil Eh during the cultivation period wa markedly retarded by water percolation . The critical initiation soil Eh of CH4 emission observed wa around -30 mV at 5 cm depth . CH4 emission during the fallow period ( from September to May ) were equivalent to 14-18 % of those during the previous cultivation period if the paddy were continuously flooded all the year round . Low soil temperature during the fallow period wa a major limiting factor for CH4 emission during these period in the case of continuously flooded treatment .

aVA prominent feature of previous long-term temperature study ha been the appearance of warming since the 1880s , this often being taken a evidence for anthropogenic-induced global warming . In this investigation , the long-term , annual , mean temperature record ( 1844-1992 ) of the Armagh Observatory ( Armagh , North Ireland ) , a set of temperature data based on maximum and minimum thermometer that predates the 1880s and correlate well with northern hemispheric and global standard , is examined for evidence of systematic variation , in particular , a related to solar-cycle forcing and secular variation . Indeed , both appear to be embedded within the Armagh data . Removal of these effect , each contributing about 8 % to the overall reduction in variance , yield residual that are randomly distributed . Application of the 10-year moving average to the residual , furthermore , strongly suggests that the behavior of the residual is episodic , inferring that ( for extended period of time ) temperature at Armagh sometimes were warmer or cooler ( than expected ) , while at other time they were stable . Comparison of cyclic average of annual mean temperature against the length of the associated Hale cycle ( i.e. , the length of two , sequentially numbered , even-odd sunspot cycle pair ) strongly suggests that the temperature correlate inversely ( r = -0.886 at < 2 % level of significance ) against the length of the associated Hale cycle . Because sunspot cycle 22 ended in 1996 , the present Hale cycle probably will be shorter than average , implying that temperature at Armagh over this Hale cycle will be warmer ( about 9.31 +/- 0.23 degree C at the 90 % confidence level ) than average ( = 9.00 degree C ) .

aVCropping and tillage management can increase atmospheric CO2 , N2O , and CH4 concentration , and contribute to global warming and destruction of the ozone layer . Fluxes of these gas in vented surface chamber , and water filled pore space ( WFPS ) and temperature of survace soil were measured weekly from a long-term winter wheat ( Triticum aestivum L. ) -fallow rotation system under chemical ( no-tillage ) and mechanical tillage ( noninversion subtillage at 7 to 10 cm or moldboard plowing to 15 cm ) follow management and compared with those from `` native '' grass sod at Sidney , NE , from March 1993 to July 1995 . Cropping , tillage , within-field location , time of year , soil temperature , and WFPS influenced net greenhouse gas flux . Mean annual interrow CO2 emission from wheat-fallow ranged from 6.9 to 20.1 kg C ha ( -1 ) d ( -1 ) and generally increased with intensity and degree of tillage ( no-till least and plow greatest ) . Nitrous oxide flux averaged autumn > winter . Winter period accounted for 4 to 10 % and 3 to 47 % of the annual CO2 and N2O flux , respectively , and 12 to 21 % of the annual CH4 uptake . Fluxes of CO2 and N2O , and CH4 uptake increased linearly with soil temperature . No-till fallow exhibited the least threat to deterioration of atmospheric or soil quality a reflected by greater CH4 uptake , decreased N2O and CO2 emission , and le loss of soil organic C than tilled soil . However , potential for increased C sequestration in this wheat-fallow system is limited due to reduced C input from intermittent cropping .

aVDespite increasing temperature since the end of the Little Ice Age ( ca . 1850 ) , wildfire frequency ha decreased a shown in many field study from North America and Europe . We believe that global warming since 1850 may have triggered decrease in fire frequency in some region and future warming may even lead to further decrease in fire frequency . Simulations of present and future fire regime , using daily output from the General Circulation Model ( GCM ) , were in good agreement with recent trend observed in fire history study . Daily data , rather than monthly data , were used because the weather and , consequently , fire behavior can change dramatically over time period much shorter than a month . The simulation and fire history result suggest that the impact of global warming on northern forest through forest fire may not be disastrous and that , contrary to the expectation of an overall increase in forest fire , there may be large region of the Northern Hemisphere with a reduced fire frequency .

aVThe problem of understanding , assessing and quantifying the cause of sea-level change ha received increased attention during the past several year , in particular in connection with prediction regarding a rise in the global mean se : a level due to global warming . The impact aspect of sea-level rise is of particular concern for many coastal area in densely populated region of the world . The present availability of space geodetic technique providing high-accuracy measurement of station position and of their time variation make it possible to separate vertical crustal movement and absolute sea-level fluctuation . Gravimetric method play an important role in the assessment of sea-level variation by providing completely independent measurement of vertical crustal movement . Satellite altimetry now enables the measurement of the spatial variability of sea level , Geological observation can infer former sea level which are important to understand the present trend . This paper address the study of height variation and secular change in sea level by discussing the most interesting question and issue , by presenting the current understanding of the phenomenon involved , and finally by illustrating the measuring and modeling technique to be adopted for a comprehensive approach to the problem .

aVThe forest cover in the hill country river catchment area of Sri Lanka ha been reduced to isolated patch on hilltop and a handful of reserve above the 1524 m ( 5000 ft ) contour . Most of the land that wa under forest cover at the turn of the nineteenth century is now covered with plantation crop . The district of Kandy , Matale , Nuwara Eliya , Badulla , Ratnapura and Kegalle are the main hill country plantation area . Within a period of le than half a century most of the forest in the hill country were cleared for plantation crop . Shifting cultivation wa responsible for deforestation in the drier part of the hill country . At the time of the British conquest of the hill country , the population of the whole island wa not more than 3/4 to 1 million and they had settled in isolated village at elevation below 1066 m. Subsistence agriculture wa the main occupation of this predominantly rural population . During the first phase ( 1830-1880 ) of the plantation industry , large tract of mostly forest land were cleared for coffee cultivation . By 1878 , the extent of the coffee plantation reached it maximum of 111 336 ha most of which wa situated in the wet zone hill country . The second phase of plantation agriculture began a the coffee industry wa completely wiped out by a leaf disease . Most of the abandoned coffee plantation and the remaining forest were converted to tea , rubber and cinchona estate . The first two crop managed to survive price fluctuation in the world market , while the latter collapsed because of over production . During the period of large-scale deforestation in the hill country , the climate also underwent change a exemplified by rainfall and temperature trend . However , these trend are not uniform everywhere in the plantation area of the hill country . The temperature ha risen a few degree over a period of about a century and quarter in the hill country station , while rainfall ha declined significantly at some station . These change seem to be a result of the interaction of both global and local factor . Although some of these change would have been a result of global warming , land use change would also have contributed to regional disparity . ( C ) 1998 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd .

aVThe environmental aspect of the electricity supply system in Korea ha been analyzed from the point of view of Life Cycle Assessment ( LCA ) . As an initial step , thermal power generation , which ha the largest portion in national electricity system and is considered to release significant amount of emission , is defined a the system . All the input and output associated with the defined system ha been identified and calculated based on the delivery of 1kWh electricity generated by thermal power to consumer . The national electricity supply system is a circle-network type connecting the whole country to a single super grid with all generator feeding into it and all consumer drawing from it . Thus , the national averaged data have been collected and used to describe the present system . The Life Cycle Inventory Analysis ( LCI ) result show that anthracite release the largest amount of airborne emission and LNG release the smallest amount of emission among the fuel used in thermal power generation . The most dominant airborne emission is CO ( 2 ) which is one of the main cause for global warming effect . Waterborne emission like COD , SS , oil etc ; and solid waste such a waste synthetic resin and combustion ash are also quantified . The result of the analysis carried out here will be a part of the basic database for indispensible electricity in LCA study for almost all industry .

aVAn atmosphere-sea-ice model is used in combination with result from a coupled atmosphere-ocean-sea-ice model to examine the change of the Antarctic sea-ice cover influenced by atmospheric circulation associated with the global sea-surface temperature ( SST ) change alone over the past century . Using the current climatological SST of Reynolds for forcing , a reasonable seasonal simulation of the Antarctic sea-ice cover for the present climate ( including ice concentration , thickness and coverage ) is obtained . When global SST anomaly for the past century ( derived from the coupled atmosphere ocean-sea-ice model ) are imposed , sea ice becomes more extensive , on the annual average , by 0.7-1.2 degree of latitude , more compact by about 5-7 % , and thicker by 7-13 cm , than at present . These change are similar to those simulated from change in greenhouse gas using the coupled atmosphere-ocean-sea-ice model which gave corresponding change of about 0.8 degree of latitude in extent , 6 % in ice concentration and 12 cm in ice thickness . The simulated change in annual mean global surface temperature by the coupled atmosphere-ocean-sea-ice model wa 0.7 K ( 0.6 K over the ocean including sea ice ) which is similar to the observed change . Over the Antarctic the corresponding simulated change is 1.2 K which also appears compatible with observation .

aVA computer model ha been written to predict the consumption of refrigerant for vehicle air conditioning in China , India , South Korea and South-East Asia , their effect on ozone depletion and global warming , and their cost . A simple logarithmic relationship between per caput income and population growth rate is assumed . Correlations between vehicle ownership and air-conditioning usage are obtained from worldwide data . Both synthetic HFC ( 134a ) and natural ( hydrocarbon ) refrigerant are considered . Sample calculation , assuming reasonable economic growth rate , predict that the use of hydrocarbon will lead to significant reduction in global warming potential and large saving in cost . The synthetic HFC option will incur cost exceeding a billion US dollar per year after the year 2005 . ( C ) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd and IIR . AII right reserved .

aVThe Cenomanian-Turonian boundary ( 90.4 Ma ) represents a major period of worldwide environmental disturbance . The physical manifestation of this are : elevated atmospheric and oceanic temperature ; a significant sea-level transgression ; and a period of widespread anoxia , leading to the formation of oceanic black shale , and the extinction of 26 % of all genus . Elevated delta ( 13 ) C value and enrichment of trace element in Cenomanian-Turonian boundary sediment , combined with a reduction in Sr-87/Sr-86 , also imply a severe environmental perturbation . At this time oceanic crustal production rate reached their highest level of the last 100 million year . This wa principally caused by extensive melting of hot mantle plume at the base of the oceanic lithosphere , and the development of vast area ( up to 1 x 10 ( 6 ) km ( 2 ) ) of thickened oceanic crust in the Pacific and Indian Oceans . The anomalous volcanism associated with the formation of these oceanic plateau may have been responsible for the environmental disturbance c. 90 Ma . These eruption would also have resulted in the emission of large quantity of CO2 into the atmosphere , leading to global warming . Additionally , the emission of SO2 , H2S , CO2 and halogen into the ocean would have made seawater more acidic resulting in the dissolution of carbonate , and further release of CO2 . This run-away greenhouse effect wa probably put into reverse , by the decline of the anomalous Volcanic activity , and by increased ( CO2-driven ) productivity in oceanic surface water , leading to increased organic carbon burial , black shale deposition , anoxia and mass extinction in the ocean basin .

aVChanges in the physiology and cost of living of fish were studied during exposure to simulated global warming and environmental acidification , alone and in combination . Trout were exposed to slightly elevated water temperature ( +2 degree C ) , in the presence and absence of sublethal acidity ( pH 5.2 ) in synthetic softwater for 90 d ( 8 degrees-12 degree C ) . Fish were either fed to satiation ( ca . 1 % -3 % of their wet-body weight daily ) or fed 1 % of their wet-body weight once every 4 d. Satiation-fed fish exposed to sublethal pH showed no ionoregulatory disturbance but exhibited increased appetite and growth compared to fish in control pH water . In contrast , fish maintained on a limited ration did not grow and showed typical ionoregulatory response to acid stress , with lower whole-body Na+ and Cl- concentration and greater mortality . Detrimental effect were greater in the global warming scenario ( +2 degree C ) . Overall , a slight temperature increase and sublethal pH increased the cost of living a determined by increased food consumption in satiation-fed fish and greater mortality in fish maintained on a limited ration . Most important , these finding suggest that fish given sufficient food can compensate for increased energy expenditure or difficulty in maintaining ion balance associated with low pH exposure .

aVThe Galapagos Penguin ( Spheniscus mendiculus ) population probably ha always been small and largely restricted to the island of Fernandina and Isabela . Counts suggest the current population of Galapagos Penguins is likely between 4,250 and 8,500 , half of what it wa in the early 1970s . Population size ha varied and declined probably because of substantial change in oceanic condition . Body condition a evidenced by weight is enhanced during cold surface water condition , La Nina , and deteriorates when surface water are warmed , El Nino , and under the most severe condition , penguin starve . Analysis of a long-term data set from count of the population suggests that the population ha fluctuated , dropping precipitously after the 1982-1983 El Nino and ha since then been recovering very slowly . This parallel the overall warming in the Pacific during the last 20 year associated with the more frequent El Nino and le frequent La Nino event . These trend suggest that long-term global climate warming is likely to threaten the Galapagos Penguin population particularly because the population is small and it distribution restricted . New threat from climatic warming and increasing human perturbation such a fishing , inadvertent discharge of petroleum product , and transport of potential predator and pathogen to island increase the risk of extinction .

aVRecent study on the nature of global warming indicate the likelihood of an asymmetric change in temperature , where night-time minimum temperature increase more rapidly than the daytime maximum temperature . We used a physically based scenario of asymmetric warming combined with climate change scenario from General Circulation Models ( GCMs ) output and the EPIC ( Erosion Productivity Impact Calculator ) plant process model to examine the effect of asymmetric temperature change on crop productivity . Our result indicated that the potential effect of global change on crop productivity may be le severe with asymmetric day-night warming than with equal day-night warming .

aVThe Prairie Pothole Region ( PPR ) of the Northern Great Plains is the most important breeding area for waterfowl in North America . Historically , the size of breeding duck population in the PPR ha been highly correlated with spring wetland condition . We show that one indicator of climate condition , the Palmer Drought Severity Index ( PDSI ) , is strongly correlated with annual count ( from 1955 to 1996 ) of both May pond ( R-2 = 0.72 , p < 0.0001 ) and breeding duck population ( R-2 = 0.69 , p < 0.0001 ) in the Northcentral U.S. , suggesting the utility of PDSI a an index for climatic factor important to wetland and duck . We then use this relationship to project future pond and duck number based on PDSI value generated from sensitivity analysis and two general circulation model ( GCM ) scenario . We investigate the sensitivity of PDSI to axed change in temperature of 0 degree C , +1.5 degree C , +2.5 degree C , and +4.0 degree C in combination with fixed change in precipitation of -10 % , +0 % , +7 % , and +15 % , change spanning the range of typically-projected value for this region from human-induced climatic change . Most ( 11 of 12 ) increased temperature scenario tested result in increased drought ( due to greater evapotranspiration under wanner temperature ) and declining number of both wetland and duck . Assuming a doubling of CO2 by 2060 , both the equilibrium and transient GCM scenario we use suggest a major increase in drought condition . Under these scenario , Northcentral U.S. breeding duck population would fluctuate around mean of 2.1 or 2.7 million duck based on the two GCMs , respectively , instead of the present long-term mean of 5.0 million . May pond number would fluctuate around mean of 0.6 or 0.8 million pond instead of the present mean of 1.3 million . The result suggest that the ecologically and economically important PPR could be significantly damaged by climate change typically projected . We make several recommendation for policy and research to help mitigate potential effect .

aVIn this ecological risk assessment we evaluated potential climate-induced vegetation change in mountain forest of Central Europe and possible impact on specie richness . The analysis wa performed on all 1 km grid point of the Swiss forest inventory ( c. 11,500 point ) a well a on two subset representing the forested point within the geographical limit of two inventory of legally protected reserve area . The core of the approach is ( a ) a conceptual model of the movement of climatic range along altitudinal gradient a a result of global warming and ( b ) a spatially explicit forest community simulator that predicts a potential natural vegetation unit for any given 1 km grid point of the Swiss forest inventory for both current climate and for altered climate regime , The model is derived from empirical data featuring the relationship between quasi-natural vegetation type and measured site variable . Species richness for any modelled forest community is estimated on the basis of phytosociological releves . The conceptual model showed that out of 109 legally protected landscape , site and natural monument of national importance ( minimum area > 1 km ( 2 ) ) about 40-50 % have an altitudinal or degree-day range that is able to host migrating specie within the reserve limit if climate is warming in a moderate way ( increase of mean annual temperature between +1.0 and + 1.4 degree C ) . In the case of strong warming ( increase of mean annual temperature between + 2.0 and + 2.8 degree C ) only 20-30 % fulfil this criterion . The spatially explicit forest simulator showed that under a temperature increase without simultaneous increase in precipitation ( warmer and more xeric due to increased evapotranspiration , Fagus-dominated community in the colline-submontane belt might eventually be replaced by oak-hornbeam ( Carpinion ) community . In the montane belt , the dominance of conifer will be seriously threatened by an invasion of deciduous specie from the low montane and submontane belt . Under warmer and wetter condition the vegetation shift might not be a drastic a under warmer and more xeric condition and the shift towards oak and oak-hornbeam community on the Plateau is not supported . Concerning specie richness , the model showed that in the case of warmer temperature and constant precipitation ( warmer and more xeric due to increased evapotranspiration ) overall specie richness is increasing on all I km point of the Swiss Forest Inventory , a well a on all selected subset representing the forested point within legally protected reserve area , In the case of warmer and wetter condition the risk assessment doe not show any drastic change in the long-term specie richness .

aVChanges in plant phenology will be one of the earliest response to rapid global climate change and could potentially have serious consequence both for plant and for animal that depend on periodically available plant resource . Phenological pattern are most diverse and least understood in the tropic . In those part of tropical Asia where low temperature or drought impose a seasonal rest period , regular annual cycle of growth and reproduction predominate at the individual , population , and community level . In aseasonal area , individual and population show a range of sub- to supra-annual periodicity , with an overall supra-annual reproductive periodicity at the community level . There is no evidence for photoperiod control of phenology in the Asian tropic , and seasonal change in temperature are a likely factor only near the northern margin . An opportunistic response to water availability is the simplest explanation for most observed pattern where water is seasonally limiting , while the great diversity of phenological pattern in the aseasonal tropic suggests an equal diversity of control . The robustness of current phenological pattern to high interannual and spatial variability suggests that most plant specie will not be seriously affected by the phenological consequence alone of climate change . However , some individual plant specie may suffer , and the consequence of change in plant phenology for flower- and fruit-dependent animal in fragmented forest could be serious .

aVWhile malaria transmission varies seasonally , large inter-annual heterogeneity of malaria incidence occurs . Variability in entomological parameter , biting rate and entomological inoculation rate ( EIR ) have been strongly associated with attack rate in child . The goal of this study wa to ass the weather 's impact on weekly biting and EIR in the endemic area of Kisian , Kenya . Entomological data collected by the U.S. Army from March 1986 through June 1988 at Kisian , Kenya wa analysed with concurrent weather data from nearby Kisumu airport . A soil moisture model of surface-water availability wa used to combine multiple weather parameter with landcover and soil feature to improve disease prediction . Modelling soil moisture substantially improved prediction of biting rate compared to rainfall ; soil moisture lagged two week explained up to 45 % of An . gambiae biting variability , compared to 8 % for raw precipitation . For An . funestus , soil moisture explained 32 % variability , peaking after a 4-week lag . The interspecies difference in response to soil moisture wa significant ( P < 0.00001 ) . A satellite normalized differential vegetation index ( NDVI ) of the study site yielded a similar correlation ( r ( 2 ) = 0.42 An . gambiae ) . Modelled soil moisture accounted for up to 56 % variability of Art . gambiae EIR , peaking at a lag of six week . The relationship between temperature and An . gambiae biting rate wa le robust ; maximum temperature r ( 2 ) = -0.20 , and minimum temperature r ( 2 ) = 0.12 after lagging one week . Benefits of hydrological modelling ore compared to raw weather parameter and to satellite NDVI . These finding can improve both current malaria risk assessment and those based on El Nino forecast or global climate change model projection .

aVTop gas recycling ha been suggested a a method for reducing blast furnace fuel rate and thus reducing carbon emission from the ironmaking process . Three method of top gas recycling are numerically investigated using a mathematical model to predict the furnace performance at fixed blast volume and constant coke , ore and pulverised coal composition with varying recycle volume . For each recycling method , a first calculation sequence is performed varying recycle volume at fixed ore : fuel ratio , and also a second sequence at fixed average liquid metal outflow temperature . Simple replacement of normal blast gas with recycled top gas is predicted to cause the production rate to decrease and the fuel rate to increase . Likewise , oxygen enriched blast replacement ha similar effect , although the severity is le a the blast oxygen rate is maintained in this case . Both of these method reduce furnace efficiency . Hot reducing gas ( HRG ) replacement , where CO2 is stripped from the recycled gas , lead to an increase in production of up to 25 % with a simultaneous decrease in fuel rate of 20 % at fixed metal temperature , These calculation show that top gas recycling could be used to increasing furnace efficiency while decreasing carbon emission thus making a positive contribution to effort to prevent global warming .

aVThe potential impact of global warming on sea-level rise in the Hudson Bay area wa examined . Land-based ice melt and thermal expansion of ocean water were compared to isostatic rebound rate . Thermal expansion wa estimated using a one-dimensional analysis and a three-dimensional world ocean general circulation model . It wa found that the combined impact on sea-level rise of land-based ice melt and thermal expansion of the world ocean wa the same order of magnitude a the sea-level fall rate due to isostatic rebound . Thus , there is the possibility of a cessation or reversal of sea-level fall in the Hudson Bay area in the next 100 yr .

aVNational and international survey data on global warming are summarized in term of level of awareness , actual knowledge , degree of concern , perceived risk , and willingness to pay or sacrifice to mitigate or adapt to potential negative impact . The data indicate the following : solid awareness of and support for general environmental goal ; an awareness of and concern for global warming ; a flawed understanding of global warming that is the result of an inappropriate application of a general pollution model ; considerable perceived threat from global warming but le so than for most other issue ; and a limited willingness to sacrifice to better cope with global warming . Although global warming generates concern around the globe , it is not a 'front-burner ' issue . Concern tends to be highest in Canada , most of Europe and South America . Errors in assessing cause of global warming are global in nature . International data demonstrates considerable support for economic sacrifice to deal with environmental problem , including global warming . Our own data support but go beyond earlier data by implying that global warming is not a salient issue , and that people across the globe will support global climate change initiative that do not levy unusual hardship ; but they can not be expected to voluntarily alter their lifestyle .

aVHurricanes can inflict catastrophic property damage and loss of human life . Thus , it is important to determine how the character of these powerful storm could change in response to greenhouse gas-induced global warming . The impact of climate warming on hurricane intensity wa investigated with a regional , high-resolution , hurricane prediction model . In a case study , 51 western Pacific storm case under present-day climate condition were compared with 51 storm case under high-CO2 condition , More idealized experiment were also performed . The large-scale initial condition were derived from a global climate model . For a sea surface temperature warming of about 2.2 degree C , the simulation yielded hurricane that were more intense by 3 to 7 meter per second ( 5 to 12 percent ) for wind speed and 7 to 20 millibar for central surface pressure .

aVEffective evaluation of alternative management strategy to control global warming requires tool for simulating emission of N ( 2 ) O from soil across a range of soil property , weather , and management input . We hypothesized that with modification to the nitrification and denitrification submodels of the Nitrate Leaching and Economic Analysis Package ( NLEAP ) model , we could simulate daily N ( 2 ) O emission a a function of soil moisture , temperature , N content , and other factor . Field parameterization wa conducted on an Ulm clay loam soil ( a fine , montmorillonitic , mesic Ustollic Haplargid ) and validation experiment for N ( 2 ) O gas emission were performed on an on farm swine effluent study site on a Valent sandy soil ( a mixed , mesic Ustic Torripsamment ) . The unitless model parameter reflecting the maximum fraction of selected N transformation emitted a N ( 2 ) O for nitrification ( alpha ( N ) ) , wet-period denitrification ( alpha ( w ) ) , and dry-period denitrifiation ( alpha ( d ) ) were calibrated a 0.065 , 0.050 , and 0.520 separately and then used in the validation study . The trend and magnitude of simulated N ( 2 ) O emission were statistically consistent , vith the result obtained from the field experiment ( r = 0.78 ) . Experimental result showed that the decline of N ( 2 ) O emission rate from 70 to 2 g N ha ( -1 ) d ( -1 ) during the growing season wa related to soil N content decline from 33 to 4 mg kg ( -1 ) . Simulated effect of field management on annual N ( 2 ) O emission indicated that plowing decreased N ( 2 ) O relative to notillage corn ( Zea may L. ) , irrigation increased N ( 2 ) O 14 % relative to dry-land corn , and doubling fertilization N rate from 100 to 200 kg ha ( -1 ) increased N ( 2 ) O emission 60 % .

aVIncreased rate of litter decay due to projected global warming could substantially alter the balance hc tw een C assimilation and release in forest soil , with consequent feedback to climate change . This study wa conducted to investigate the effect of soil warming on the decomposition of red spruce ( Picea rubens Sarg , ) and red maple ( Acer rubrum L. ) foliar litter at Howland , ME , Experimentally increased Oa horizon soil temperature ( increase of 4-5 degree C ) were maintained during the snow-free season from 1993 through 1995 in replicated 15 by 15 m plot using heat-resistance cable . For red maple litter , significant treatment effect included greater loss of mass ( 27 % ) and C ( 33 % ) , and greater accumulation of Zn ( 54 % ) during the first 6 mo of decay in the heated plot than the control plot , After 30 mo of decay , significant treatment effect were no longer evident for red maple litter . Few treatment effect were observed for red spruce litter during the initial 18 mo of decay . However , after 30 mo of decay , significant treatment effect included greater loss of mass ( 19 % ) , C ( 19 % ) . N ( 24 % ) , Ca ( 27 % ) , Mg ( 12 % ) , K ( 4 % ) , Zn ( 60 % ) , and cellulose ( 40 % ) in red spruce litter in the heated plot than the control plot . We conclude that a modest increase in Oa horizon soil temperature ( 4-5 degree C ) ran significantly increase litter decay rate and alter litter decay dynamic in this coniferous forest stand , and that these change exhibit variation in their temporal development a a function of specie and litter quality attribute .

aVPaleoclimatic study indicate four epoch of global cooling during the last 4 000 year , i.e , during the few century before and after 2000 BC , 800 BC , 400 AD , and 1 600 AD ; the quasiperiodicity corresponds to cyclic variation of solar activity . Global temperature change influenced regional precipitation pattern : Northern Europe wa wetter while the middle- and low-latitude land were more aria during colder epoch . Both set of cold climatical condition were unfavorable for agricultural production . Historical record show that large demographic movement in history took place because of crop failure and mass starvation , rather than escaping from war zone . The `` wandering '' of the Germanic tribe during the first two or three century of the Christian Era is one example . Whereas the accelerated release of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuel is ultimately to cause global warming , historical evidence indicates , however , that global warming ha been on the whole a blessing to mankind . Global cooling , on the other hand , ha curtailed agricultural production and ha led to famine and mass migration of people . Perhaps the most important task at the present is not so much computer-modelling of greenhouse effect on global climate , but water-management and agricultural research to insure food-supply for an everincreasing world population .

aVVertical profile of dimethylsulfide ( DMS ) and beta-dimethylsulfoniopropionate , particulate ( pDMSP ) and dissolved ( dDMSP ) , were measured biweekly in the upper 140 m of the Sargasso Sea ( 32 degree 10'N , 64 degree 30'W ) during 1992 and 1993 . DMS and pDMSP showed strong , but different , seasonal pattern ; no distinct intra-annual pattern wa observed for dDMSP . During winter , concentration of DMS were generally le than 1 nmol l ( -1 ) at all depth , dDMSP wa le than 3 nmol l ( -1 ) and pDMSP wa le than 8 nmol l ( -1 ) . In spring , concentration of both dDMSP and pDMSP rose , on a few occasion up to 20 nmol l ( -1 ) in the dissolved pool and up to 27 nmol l ( -1 ) in the particulate pool . These increase , due to bloom of DMSP-containing phytoplankton , resulted in only minor increase in DMS concentration ( up to 4 nmol l ( -1 ) ) . Throughout the summer , the concentration of DMS continued to increase , reaching a maximum in August of 12 nmol l ( -1 ) ( at 30 m depth ) . There wa no concomitant summer increase in dDMSP or pDMSP , The difference among the seasonal pattern of DMS , dDMSP , and pDMSP suggest that the physical and biological process involved in the cycling of DMS change with the season . There is a correlation between the concentration of DMS and temperature in this data set , a required by some of the climate feedback model that have been suggested for DMS . A full understanding of the underlying process controlling DMS is required to determine if the temperature-DMS pattern is of significance in the context of global climate change .

aVA field drought-rewetting treatment wa artificially imposed in a Picea abies ( L. ) Karst . stand in each of four consecutive year ( 1992-1995 ) by mean of a roof installed beneath the canopy . It wa removed each year to allow natural rainfall rewet the soil in order to test Ulrich 's ( 1980 ) 'Acidification pulse ' hypothesis , viz . that rewetting a soil subsequent to drought result in net nitrification and acidification . NH4+ concentration in the Drought plot humus water increased substantially following drought and rewetting in 1992 ( 3754 mu mol ( c ) L-1 , i.e . 36 % total cation ) , to a lesser degree in 1994 and 1995 , and were accompanied by elevated pH value tin the range pH 5.7 to 6.3 ) , whereas NH4+ level and pH value ( between pH 3.7 and 3.8 ) were unaffected during these time in the Control plot humus water . High NO3- concentration were observed in the Drought humus water immediately after drought and rewetting in 1992 , whereas in 1994 and 1995 there wa a time-lag during which nitrate concentration increased steadily . In contrast , NH4+ and NO3- concentration were consistently low at all depth in the mineral soil water of both the Drought and Control plot throughout the year of the experiment . Likewise , pH value were unaffected in the mineral soil water at these time , suggesting that microbiological activity and nitrification wa largely confined to the O horizon at this site . This research then , indicates that Ulrich 's hypothesis wa not applicable in the Ballyhooly site . Ammonification dominated over nitrification after drought and rewetting under current Irish climatic condition . However , under condition of increased air temperature , a in the 'global warming ' scenario , the potential for enhanced nitrification and consequent acidification and leaching of NO3- produced after drought and rewetting may exist at Ballyhooly .

aVBoreal forest cover 10 % of the land surface and experience wide range of temperature and precipitation . In many part of the boreal zone , fire drive vegetation succession , landscape dynamic and carbon cycling . Global climate change may affect the frequency and size of wildfire and alter the rate of carbon release into the atmosphere . Monitoring change in fire frequency are therefore vital for forest management and predicting climate change impact . The continuity of remotely sensed data , combined with the extent and remoteness of the boreal ecosystem make Earth observation an important tool for fire monitoring . This Letter examines the applicability of data from SPOT-Vegetation for regional fire monitoring in the context of other available Earth observation instrument . We show that use of the middle-infrared waveband give a more reliable indication of fire scar than vegetation index approach currently employed .

aVSugar maple decline ha been a prominent issue since the late 1970s , when large area of Quebec and Ontario were affected by this phenomenon . Links have been established between decline and insect damage , airborne heavy metal and acidic pollutant , and drought . Research ha also indicated that global warming and resulting climactic change may also cause decline . The phenomenon can be partially alleviated by proper management of sugar bush . Although sugar maple decline ha been on the wane over recent year , it may pose a serious problem in the future .

aVThe transportation sector need to reduce fuel consumption to deal with global warming because it depends on fossil fuel strongly and it seems to be difficult to substitute other fuel . This study aim at investigating an optimal land use in urban area from the viewpoint of reducing energy consumption for transportation . For this purpose , the author developed two kind of model . One minimizes the total trip length under the condition of constant congestion . The other minimizes the fuel consumption directly where congestion is taken into account endogenously . The optimal structure calculated numerically illustrate that business area are located around the center of a city while residential area are on the suburb , which is similar to the actual land use observed generally . These result are compared with the land use of the central business district ( CBD ) in Tokyo . ( C ) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All right reserved .

aVForest vegetation ha the ability to warm Recent climate by it effect on albedo and atmospheric water vapour , but the role of vegetation in warming climate of the geologic past is poorly understood . This study evaluates the role of forest vegetation in maintaining warm climate of the Late Cretaceous by ( 1 ) reconstructing global palaeovegetation for the latest Cretaceous ( Maastrichtian ) ; ( 2 ) modelling latest Cretaceous climate under unvegetated condition and different distribution of palaeovegetation ; and ( 3 ) comparing model output with a global database of palaeoclimatic indicator . Simulation of Maastrichtian climate with the land surface coded a bare soil produce high-latitude temperature that are too cold to explain the documented palaeogeographic distribution of forest and woodland vegetation . In contrast , simulation that include forest vegetation at high latitude show significantly warmer temperature that are sufficient to explain the widespread geographic distribution of high-latitude deciduous forest . These warmer temperature result from decreased albedo and feedback between the land surface and adjacent ocean . Prescribing a realistic distribution of palaeovegetation in model simulation produce the best agreement between simulated climate and the geologic record of palaeoclimatic indicator . Positive feedback between high-latitude forest , the atmosphere , and ocean contributed significantly to high-latitude warming during the latest Cretaceous , and imply that high-latitude forest vegetation wa an important source of polar warmth during other warm period of geologic history .

aVA nonlinear dynamical perspective on climate prediction is outlined , based on a treatment of climate a the attractor of a nonlinear dynamical system D with distinct quasi-stationary regime . The main application is toward anthropogenic climate change , considered a the response of D to a small-amplitude imposed forcing f. The primary feature of this perspective can be summarized a follows . First , the response to f will be manifest primarily in term of change to the residence frequency associated with the quasi-stationary regime . Second , the geographical structure of these regime will be relatively insensitive to f. Third , the large-scale signal will be most strongly influenced by f in rather localized region of space and time . In this perspective , the signal arising from f will be strongly dependent of D 's natural variability . A theoretical framework for the perspective is developed based on a singular vector decomposition of D 's tangent propagator . Evidence for the dyamical perspective is drawn from a number of observational and modeling study of intraseasonal , interannual , and interdecadal variability , and from climate change integration . It is claimed that the dynamical perspective might resolve the apparent discrepancy in global warming trend deduced from surface and free troposphere temperature measurement . A number of specific recommendation for the evaluation of climate model are put forward , based on the idea developed in this paper .

aV1 . In the early 1990s , birch Betula pubescens L. forest in north-western Norway were damaged by the bud- and shoot-mining larva of Argyresthia retinella not previously known for outbreak . In 1993-96 , the outbreak wa mapped and change in attack intensity and foliage structure were quantified by sampling birch twig along transects from coast to inland . Results were considered in relation to a variable climate . 2 . The outbreak extended 400 km along the coast , mainly within the lowest 100-150 m a.s.l . It started in the late 1980s and the attack intensity culminated in 1993-94 . Repeatedly , 30-50 % of the leaf-carrying shoot were damaged or killed . Trees compensated by sprouting cluster of shoot from undamaged shoot and , hence , increased foliage clumping . Eventually , twig and branch died . 3 , The overwintering post-diapause egg , the larva and the adult stage were considered the most sensitive to change in temperature climate . The air temperature , averaged for a combination of these stage , wa calculated for each year , a well a deviation from the long-term ( 1868-1996 ) average . 4 , The 5-year running average of deviation approached or exceeded +1 degree C three time : in the 1930s , around 1960 and around 1990 . The third peak coincided with the outbreak of the 1990s . There are no report of an A. retinella outbreak in either the 1930s or 1960s . However , in one photographic documentation from 1940 , clumped foliage structure of birch suggests an outbreak in the 1930s . 5 . Severe A. retinella attack appear to be a fairly new phenomenon , possibly connected to recent high temperature deviation . If so , with the present air temperature climate , outbreak may occur at interval of approximate to 20-25 year . With a trend of decreasing air temperature , outbreak may be le frequent . At higher temperature , natural or from anthropogenic global warming , the outcome is more uncertain although more frequent outbreak may occur initially . 6 . It is recommended that forester learn to identify damage made by A. retinella and include observation on this insect in their reporting . Monitoring A. retinella damage in the North and elsewhere , should contribute to the understanding of the outbreak ecology of this insect .

aVThe Mumbai ( Bombay ) tide gauge data , the only century-long record in the Indian Ocean , show that interdecadal change in sea level mimic those in rainfall over the Indian subcontinent . We propose that the link between rainfall and sea level arises from change in salinity in coastal water . Rivers fed by southwest monsoon ( June-September ) rainfall bring a large fraction of the runoff to the Bay of Bengal , from where it is transported to the west coast of India by an equatorward East India Coastal Current , which is triggered partly by the withdrawal of the southwest monsoon . The West India Coastal Current carry the low-salinity water from the bay a well a the runoff from local river northward . The advection of the riverine inflow to Mumbai occurs within a season . but the slow mixing in the ocean force change in the cross-shore density gradient on longer timescales . This density gradient force a two-layer geostrophic circulation , with a surface current , which flow with the lighter water on it right , and an undercurrent . Lower ( higher ) salinity at the coast implies higher ( lower ) coastal sea level and a rise ( fall ) of the pycnocline at the coast . Thus the interdecadal variability of sea level along the Indian coast can be Linked directly to the variability of the monsoon , the major aspect of the climate of the region , but by a mechanism that is different from those generally proposed to link sea level to climate change ; these hypothesis usually invoke a change in volume because of global warming .

aVWe describe the method used to compute the global warming potential of hydrofluorocarbon ( HFC ) 245fa ( CHF2CH2CF3 ) . The Atmospheric and Environmental Research ( AER ) two-dimensional ( latitude-height ) chemistry-transport model wa used to calculate the atmospheric lifetime and atmospheric scale height of HFC-245fa . Assuming that reaction with OH is the only removal mechanism , the recommended rate constant from Jet Propulsion Laboratory [ 1997 ] ( 6.1 x 10 ( -13 ) exp ( -1330/T ) cm ( 3 ) s ( -1 ) ) implies a lifetime of 7.6 pear and an average atmospheric scale height of 35 km in the stratosphere . Using the IR absorption cross section for HFC-245fa and CFC-11 determined in the laboratory , the AER one-dimensional radiative-convective model wa used to calculate the radiative forcing , The value for HFC-245fa is 1.14 time larger than that for CFC-11 on a mass basis and 1.11 larger on a per molecule basis . The global warming potential for HFC-245fa ( relative to carbon dioxide ) are 2400 , 760 , and 240 ( based on the value for absolute global warming potential for carbon dioxide reported by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [ 1996 ] ) at integration time horizon of 20 , 100 , and 500 year , respectively .

aVThe rate constant for the reaction of OH radical with the fluorinated ether , CHF2-O-CHF2 ( HFOC-134 ) and CF3CH2-O-CH2CF3 ( HFOC-356mff ) , were measured using the flash photolysis resonance fluorescence technique over the temperature range 277-370 K to give the following Arrhenius expression : k ( HFOC-134 ) ( T ) = ( 0.63 ( -0.16 ) ( +0.20 ) ) x 10 ( -12 ) exp\u005c { - ( 1646 +/- 76 ) /T\u005c } cm ( 3 ) molecule ( -1 ) s ( -1 ) , k ( HFOC-356mff ) ( T ) ( 2.32 ( -0.41 ) ( +0.46 ) ) x 10 ( -12 ) : exp\u005c { - ( 790 +/- 47 ) /T\u005c } cm ( 3 ) molecule ( -1 ) s ( -1 ) . On the basis of the analysis of the available experimental result , the following Arrhenius expression can be recommended for the rate constant of the reaction between OH and HFOC-134 : k ( HFOC-134 ) ( T ) = ( 0.82 ( -0.24 ) ( +0.34 ) ) x 10 ( -12 ) exp\u005c { - ( 1730 +/- 110 ) /T\u005c } cm ( 3 ) molecule ( -1 ) s ( -1 ) . Atmospheric lifetime were estimated to be 24.8 year for HFOC-134 ( 23.8 year based on the result of this study alone ) and 0.3 year for HFOC-356mff . Infrared absorption cross section of HFOC-134 , HFOC-356mff , and HFOC-125 ( CHF2-O-CF3 ) were measured at T = 295 K from 500 to 1600 cm ( -1 ) and the global warming potential of the three compound were estimated . Ultraviolet absorption spectrum of the ether were measured between 160 and 220 Mm . The general pattern of reactivity of hydrofluoroethers toward OH is discussed .

aVTo determine the long-term impact of elevated CO2 on primary production of native tallgrass prairie , we compared the response of tallgrass prairie at ambient and twice-ambient atmospheric CO2 level over an 8-year period . Plots in open-top chamber ( 4.5 m diameter ) were exposed continuously ( 24 h ) to ambient and elevated CO2 from early April to late October each year . Unchambered plot were monitored also . Aboveground peak biomass wa determined by clipping each year in early August , and root growth wa estimated by harvesting root from root ingrowth bag . Plant community composition wa censused each year in early June . In the last 2 year of the study , subplots were clipped on 1 June or 1 July , and regrowth wa harvested on 1 October . Volumetric soil water content of the 0-100 cm soil layer wa determined using neutron scattering , and wa generally higher in elevated CO2 plot than ambient . Peak aboveground biomass wa greater on elevated CO2 plot than ambient CO2 plot with or without chamber during year with significant plant water stress . Above-ground regrowth biomass wa greater under elevated CO2 than under ambient CO2 in a year with late-season water stress , but did not differ in a wetter year . Root ingrowth biomass wa also greater in elevated CO2 plot than ambient CO2 plot when water stress occurred during the growing season . The basal cover and relative amount of warm-season perennial grass ( C4 ) in the stand changed little during the 8-year period , but basal cover and relative amount of cool-season perennial grass ( C3 ) in the stand declined in the elevated CO2 plot and in ambient CO2 plot with chamber . Forbs ( C3 ) and member of the Cyperaceae ( C3 ) increased in basal cover and relative amount in the stand at elevated compared to ambient CO2 . Greater biomass production under elevated CO2 in C4-dominated grassland may lead to a greater carbon sequestration by those ecosystem and reduce peak atmospheric CO2 concentration in the future .

aVSubstitute fluorocarbon may have direct environmental impact , for trample a greenhouse gas , or indirect impact through the product of their decomposition in the environment . The mechanism of that atmospheric decomposition are reviewed here and shown to be well established now . The end product are halogen acid and trifluoroacetic acid , all of which pre-exist in the environment in quantity greater than are expected to arise from fluorocarbon use and emission . Furthermore , the growth in use of fluorocarbon replacement ha been shown to be far le than the fall in CFC and Halon production . Hydrochlorofluorocarbons ( HCFCs ) have replaced le than one third of CFCs and are , themselves , ozone depleting substance that will be phased out under the Montreal Protocol . The growth in hydrofluorocarbon ( HFCs ) amount to about 10 % of the fall in CFCs . It is likely that the impact of new fluorocarbon on climate change will be a very small fraction of the total impact , which come mainly from the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .

aVChanges in Heat Index ( a combined measure of temperature and humidity ) associated with global warming are evaluated based on the output from four extended integration of the GFDL coupled ocean-atmosphere climate model . The four integration are : a control with constant level of atmospheric carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , a second integration in which an estimate of the combined radiative forcing of greenhouse gas and sulfate aerosol over the period 1765-2065 is used to force the model , and a third ( fourth ) integration in which atmospheric CO2 increase at the rate of 1 % per year to double ( quadruple ) it initial value , and is held constant thereafter . While the spatial pattern of the change in Heat Index are largely determined by the change in surface air temperature , increase in atmospheric moisture can substantially amplify the change in Heat Index over region which are warm and humid in the Control integration . The region most prone to this effect include humid region of the Tropics and summer hemisphere extra-tropics , including the southeastern United States , India , southeast Asia and northern Australia .

aVEvidence of anthropogenic global climate change is accumulating , but it potential consequence for insect distribution have received little attention . We use a 'climate response surface ' model to investigate distribution change at the northern margin of the speckled wood butterfly Para , ge aegeria . We relate it current European distribution to a combination of three bioclimatic variable . We document that P. aegeria ha expanded it northern margin substantially since 1940 , that change in this specie ) distribution over the past 100 year are likely to have been due to climate change , and that I ? aegeria will have the potential to shift it range margin substantially northward under predicted future climate change . At current rate of expansion , this specie could potentially colonize all newly available climatically suitable habitat in the UK over the nest 50 year or more . However , fragmentation of habitat can affect colonization , and Mle show that availability of habitat may be constraining range expansion of this specie at it northern margin in the UK . These lag effect may be even more pronounced in less-mobile specie inhabiting more fragmented landscape , and highlight how habitat distribution will be crucial in predicting specie ' response to future climate change .

aVThe aim of this article is twofold . We first summarize our current scientific knowledge about the potential influence of human activity on climate . This review is largely based on the conclusion of the 1995 IPCC report ( International Panel on Climate Change ) . An increase in atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gas ha been observed since 1750 ( CH4 = 145 % ; CO2 = 30 % ; N2O = 15 % ) and in the temperature of the Earth 's surface since 1860 ( between 0.3 and 0.6 degree C ) . This report suggests a discernable human influence on climate and predicts significant global warming for the next century ( 1 to 3.5 degree C ) a a result of the anthropogenic increase of the greenhouse effect . We then show how study of past climate have , over the last ten year , contributed to this problem by providing information relevant to the future of our climate . Important result concern the existence of a relationship between climate and concentration of greenhouse gas for more than 200 000 year , the discovery of rapid climatic change ( similar to 10 degree C in a few decade in Greenland ) and the reconstruction of recent climate showing that the 20th century is the warmest since 1 400 AD .

aVThe Romagna coastal area in the Northern Adriatic Sea ha experienced in recent time continuous change because of it precarious environment and low ground elevation above mean sea level ( msl ) . Major process that may influence the stability of the coast profile include land subsidence of both natural and anthropogenic origin and the msl rise caused by global climate change . According to the most accredited modeling prediction msl is expected to rise by almost 0.5 m over the next century because of the greenhouse effect . Natural land subsidence is the result of deep downward tectonic movement and consolidation of geologically recent deposit . It may be estimated in the range of 2-2.5 mm/yr in the Ravenna area and twice a much in the Po River delta . Anthropogenic land subsidence is primarily related to groundwater pumping from the upper fresh water aquifer system and gas production from Plio-Pleistocene reservoir . Geodetic survey from 1953 to 1990 provide documentary evidence of cumulative land settlement exceeding 0.8 m and 1.2 m at Marina di Ravenna and Cesenatico , respectively . In this study we estimate both natural and anthropogenic land subsidence for the year 2015 , 2050 , and 2100 with the aid of ad hoc finite element simulation model . The use of these prediction together with the expected msl rise show that many present lowland may be permanently submerged at the end of the next century . The extent of the flooded area of the Romagna coastal region can be a much a 690 and 910 km ( 2 ) , using optimistic and pessimistic land subsidence scenario , respectively . A local detailed analysis indicates that the area around the city of Ravenna and Cesenatico may be seriously affected by sea water ingression while the city of Rimini is well protected because of it relatively high elevation above msl .

aVA process-based model for the consumption of atmospheric methane ( CH ( 4 ) ) by soil wa developed to identify the most important factor affecting uptake rate and to determine whether the current uncertainty in the estimated size of the global soil sink might be reduced . Descriptions of diffusion and microbial oxidation process , which together determine the CH ( 4 ) flux , were included . The result suggest that the global sink strength lie within the range 20-51 Tg yr ( -1 ) CH ( 4 ) , with a preferred value of 38 Tg yr ( -1 ) CH ( 4 ) . Dry tropical ecosystem account for almost a third of this total . Here microbial activity rather than diffusion is limiting uptake . It is also in these area that the impact of any intensification in agriculture will be the most pronounced , with a possible future reduction in uptake in excess of 3 Tg y ( -1 ) CH ( 4 ) . This is in contrast to the overall impact of global warming , which is expected to leave the size of the global soil sink relatively unchanged .

aVNewly available data indicate that darn fragment the fluvial system of the continental United States and that their impact on river discharge is several time greater than impact deemed likely a a result of global climate change . The 75,000 dam in the continental United States are capable of storing a volume of water almost equaling one year 's mean runoff , but there is considerable geographic variation in potential surface water impact . In some western mountain and plain region , darn can store more than 3 year 's runoff , while in the Northeast and Northwest , storage is a little a 25 % of the annual runoff . Dams partition watershed ; the drainage area per dam varies from 44 km ( 2 ) ( 17 mile ( 2 ) ) per dam in New England to 811 km ( 2 ) ( 313 mile ( 2 ) ) per dam in the Lower Colorado basin . Storage volume , indicator of general hydrologic effect of darn , range from 26,200 m ( 3 ) km ( -2 ) ( 55 acre-foot mile ( -2 ) ) in the Great Basin to 345,000 m ( 3 ) km ( -2 ) ( 725 acre-foot mile-2 ) in the South Atlantic region . The greatest river flow impact occur in the Great Plains , Rocky Mountains , and the arid Southwest , where storage is up to 3.8 time the mean annual runoff . The nation 's dam store 5000 m ( 3 ) ( 4 acre-foot ) of water per person . Water resource region have experienced individualized history of cumulative increase in reservoir storage ( and thus of downstream hydrologic and ecologic impact ) , but the most rapid increase in storage occurred between the late 1950s and the late 1970s . Since 1980 , increase in storage have been relatively minor .

aVGlobal warming is increasingly recognized a a threat to the survival of human being , because it could cause a serious increase in the occurrence of disease due to environmental heat during intermittent hot weather . To ass the direct impact of extremely hot weather on human health , we investigated heal-related death in Japan from 1968 through 1994 , analyzing the data to determine the distribution of the death by age and their correlation to the incidence of hot day in summer . Vital Statistics of Japan , published by the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan , wa the source of the heat-related mortality data employed in this study Meteorological data were obtained from the District Meteorological Observatories in Tokyo and Osaka , the two largest city in Japan . Heat-related death were most prone to occur on day with a peak daily temperature above 38 degree C , and the incidence of these death showed an exponential dependence on the number of hot day . Thus , even a small rise in atmospheric temperature may lead to a considerable increase in heat-related mortality , indicating the importance of combating global warming . Furthermore , half ( 50.1 % ) of the above-noted death occurred in child ( 4 year and under ) and the elderly ( 70 year and over ) irrespective of gender , indicating the vulnerability of these specific age group to heat . Since a warmer climate is predicted in the future , the incidence of heat wave will increase , and more comprehensive measure , both medical and social , should be adopted for child of 4 year and younger the elderly to prevent heat-related death in these age group .

aVThis study investigates the temporal and spatial variation of soil moisture associated with global warming a simulated by long-term integration of a coupled ocean-atmosphere model conducted earlier . Starting from year 1765 , integration of the coupled model for 300 year were performed for three scenario : increasing greenhouse gas only , increasing sulfate-aerosol loading only and the combination of both radiative forcings . The integration with the combined radiative forcings reproduces approximately the observed increase of global mean surface air temperature during the 20th century . Analysis of this integration indicates that both summer dryness and winter wetness occur in middle-to-high latitude of North America and southern Europe . These feature were identified in earlier study . However , in the southern part of North America where the percentage reduction of soil moisture during summer is quite large , soil moisture is decreased for nearly the entire annual cycle in response to greenhouse warming . A similar observation applies to other semi-arid region in subtropical to middle latitude such a central Asia and the area surrounding the Mediterranean Sea . On the other hand , annual mean runoff is greatly increased in high latitude because of increased poleward transport of moisture in the warmer model atmosphere . An analysis of the central North American and southern European region indicates that the time when the change of soil moisture exceeds one standard deviation about the control integration occurs considerably later than that of surface air temperature for a given experiment because the ratio of forced change to natural variability is much smaller for soil moisture compared with temperature . The corresponding lag time for runoff change is even greater than that of either precipitation or soil moisture for the same reason . Also according to the above criterion , the inclusion of the effect of sulfate aerosol in the greenhouse warming experiment delay the noticeable change of soil moisture by several decade . It appears that observed surface air temperature is a better indicator of greenhouse warming than hydrologic quantity such a precipitation , runoff and soil moisture . Therefore , we are unlikely to notice definitive CO2-induced continental summer dryness until several decade into the 21st century .

aVThis paper describes the development of a semi-quantitative pre-LCA ( life-cycle assessment ) tool for assessing the environmental impact of the production of a printer . This tool provides a quick-and-easy mean of assessing the environmental impact of a complex product , where a full LCA evaluation of the complex product would often require extensive calculation and the analysis is very time-consuming and place a heavy burden on the designer . The tool allows a designer to easily compute a total environmental impact value for each of the various alternative design . The pre-LCA tool computes an environmental impact value by considering factor such a airborne and waterborne emission , the recyclability potential , waste disposal , the global warming factor , the energy content of raw material , the divertible plastic waste potential , etc . The analytical hierarchy comparison method is used for the designer to indicate the relative importance of these factor with respect to their design . Environmental value for the various factor are calculated from graph that have been derived based on extensive interview with engineer involved in the production process , a well a from literature research .

aVMacquarie Island is the southernmost limit to the distribution of the black rat Rattus rattus . The specie wa introduced to this subantarctic island by sealer during the 19th century . The rat are now widespread and abundant in coastal area all around the island . The distribution of rat population is divided into discrete unit by the availability of suitable habitat which , in turn , is a consequence of the rugged topography , particularly on the west coast . Rats are found from almost sea level to 200-250 m a.s.l . and up to 1 km inland . They have adapted successfully to the rigorous climate and firmly occupy a habitat niche in an environment where food is plentiful , predator are few and interspecific competition minimal . The principal habitat , tall Poa foliosa tussock grassland , provides year-round shelter and food . Rats dig burrow in the peaty stool of the tussock plant and construct nesting chamber at the base of the dense leaf canopy . Predictably , this provides a warmer and more stable thermal environment than that experienced outside under the tussock canopy where the run are located . Tussock grassland are spreading under the influence of management control measure directed at the introduced European rabbit and possibly global warming . Management programme are also directed towards the eradication of feral cat . In response , rat population may be expected to expand in number and to occupy new territory . Without control this may , in the long term , have serious consequence for the island 's avifauna , particularly the smaller , burrow-nesting specie .

aVConsider an economy described by two state . The first state describes a private stock subject to a firm 's ( or a consumer 's ) control , while the second state capture market interaction and is exogenous data to the individual firm . Considering rational expectation , a market equilibrium can be derived . This set-up is typical , in particular for the recently investigated new endogenous growth model . In contrast to the market outcome , planning attempt to internalise this externality . In both case , the policy - either the optimal intertemporal policy of competitive firm exposed to this externality , or the social optimum - are characterised by a two-dimensional plane . Thus , complex solution in particular limit cycle are possible . This paper compare the condition of stability and , in particular , the condition for limit cycle under these two different institutional set-ups , when the externality is or is not properly internalised . This comparison is first theoretical and then applied to a deliberately simple economic example : firm accumulate a capital stock ( e.g. , sewage treatment , energy saving technology ) involving convex investment cost and this stock lower emission ( or kind of waste ) that add to a stock of pollution ( e.g . global warming , pollution of water and soil , etc . ) .

aVThermoluminescence age from a longitudinal dunefield in tropical northern Australia suggest that complete dune activation occurred here either continuously or sporadically between approximately 8.2 ka and 5.9 ka . This period , in Australia , is normally ascribed to one of increasingly warm and wet condition towards the Holocene Climatic Optimum . However , elsewhere , this time ( similar to 8 ka ) coincides with a brief period of global climate change recognized in O-18 record From Antarctica , methane record of the Greenland Summit ice core , change to deep-sea benthic foraminferal composition and atmospheric C-14 variation . Tn tropical Africa two distinct phase of aridity have been dated at approximately 8 ka and 6 ka . The coincidence of aeolian reactivation episode in this north Australian dunefield with brief phase of early-Holocene climate change elsewhere suggests possible global climatic teleconnections at this time .

aVDevelopment of stem nematode ( Ditylenchus dipsaci ) infestation of white clover ( Trifolium repens ) in artificially established sward and transplanted turf wa monitored at field site with different mean daily temperature . In artificial sward the level of nematode infestation wa inversely related to mean daily temperature . In transplanted turf , nematode caused a 46 % reduction in white clover density over an 18-month period ; the level of damage wa not significantly affected by mean daily temperature although the proportion of clover stolon infested wa higher at colder temperature . Reductions in infestation level at higher temperature are probably the result of reduced survival in soil and the upper lethal temperature for nematode being exceeded more frequently under warmer condition .

aVAlthough numerous study indicate that increasing atmospheric CO2 or temperature data are available on the response of three major component of soil respiration [ i.e . rhizosphere respiration ( root and root exudate ) , litter decomposition , and oxidation of soil organic matter ] to different CO2 and temperature condition . In this study , we applied a dual stable isotope approach to investigate the impact of elevated CO2 and elevated temperature on these component of soil CO2 efflux in Douglas-fir terracosms . We measured both soil CO2 efflux rate and the C-13 and O-18 isotopic composition of soil CO2 efflux in 12 sun-lit and environmentally controlled terracosms with 4-year-old Douglas fir seedling and reconstructed forest soil under two CO2 concentration ( ambient and 200 ppmv above ambient ) and two air temperature regime ( ambient and 4 degree C above ambient ) . The stable isotope data were used to estimate the relative contribution of different component to the overall soil CO2 efflux . In most case , litter decomposition wa the dominant component of soil CO2 efflux in this system , followed by rhizosphere respiration and soil organic matter oxidation . Both elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration and elevated temperature stimulated rhizosphere respiration and litter decomposition . The oxidation of soil organic matter wa stimulated only by increasing temperature . Release of newly fixed carbon a root respiration wa the most responsive to elevated CO2 , while soil organic matter decomposition wa most responsive to increasing temperature . Although some assumption associated with this new method need to be further validated , application of this dual-isotope approach can provide new insight into the response of soil carbon dynamic in forest ecosystem to future climate change .

aVNovel cleaning process harmonized environmentally by using O-2 plasma with a new fluorocarbon radical source ha been developed for replacing the conventional process using green house gas , such a SF6 gas and fluorocarbon feed gas causing global warming . The new fluorocarbon radical source wa designed to generate fluorocarbon reactive specie from polytetrafluoroethylene ( PTFE ) by CO2 laser ablation . An electron cyclotron resonance ( ECR ) O-2 plasma equipped with the fluorocarbon radical source ha been applied to amorphous silicon ( a-Si ) and tungsten ( W ) etching for chamber cleaning process after chemical vapor deposition ( CVD ) . As a result , the etching of a-Si and W were successfully demonstrated . These result indicate this process is potentially applied to the chamber cleaning process keeping harmony with the environment , particularly for preventing global warming .

aVThe composition of epicuticular wax from conifer constituting the predominant specie of western North America were determined by GC and GC-MS . The primary component identified include alkane , fatty acid , fatty alcohol , aldehyde , ketone , phytosterols , triterpenoids and wax ester . Average chain length ( ACL ) for alkane in Oregon conifer decreased with increasing distance away from the Coastal range which suggests an adaptation by conifer to humid climate condition . Differences in the chemical composition make this information useful for chemotaxonomic purpose , for identifying natural organic aerosol input source to the atmosphere , for comparison with the tracer in smoke emission from burning of these biomass fuel , and for monitoring in assessment of global climate change .

aVEpidemiologic concept have important application in the assessment of ecosystem health and ecosystem health is a critical determinant of some epidemiologic event . Thus the two are intimately interrelated and concept from one find ready application in the other . The temporal and spatial spread of ecological degradation across the earth 's ecosystem ha some of the characteristic of an epidemiologic process , with human a the `` infective '' agent . Elevated disease prevalence in both plant and animal is one of the key indicator of ecosystem pathology , and conversely , pathologic ecosystem place increased risk to the health of all component , thus ecosystem health becomes a major determinant of risk to the health of component population . These relation suggest important link between the area of epidemiology , phytopathology , and system ecology , Understanding these link can provide enhanced capacity for diagnosis and risk assessment in ail three area .

aVIn order to measure CO2 flux in wintertime arctic ecosystem , CO2 gas wa sampled from various snow-covered ground by using a closed chamber method during the First China Arctic Scientific Expedition from March to May in 1995 . The CO2 gas sample were measured by using an infra-red analyzer ( IRGA ) . The result show-ed that ( i ) CO2 emission wa detected from all kind of the snow-covered ground , which provides direct evidence that the arctic tundra is functioning a a source of atmospheric CO2 ; ( ii ) CO2 release wa also detected from the permanent ice profile and icecap , and ( iii ) CO , evolution from terrestrial ecosystem in higher latitude increased with an increase of surface temperature in accordance with the exponential function . This indicates a close coincidence with that under normal temperature condition , and provides a useful method for predicting change in CO2 flux in the arctic ecosystem with the global climate change .

aVThe recent expansion of the Red Sea macroalga Caulerpa racemosa and it impact on the diversity and abundance of macrobenthos were examined and compared in the summer of 1992 and 1997 , in Moni Bay , Cyprus . The phytobenthic community of the bay in 1992 wa dominated by the seagrass Posidonia oceanica while , in 1997 , the Lessepsian migrant C. racemosa became the most dominant , forming extensive mar . Changes in the vegetation system in Moni Bay have caused significant compositional change in macrofaunal assemblage . A total of 178 individual of 62 specie are recorded . The composition of the macrofauna in 1992 wa dominated by gastropod ( 44 % ) , crustacean ( 22 % ) , bivalve ( 17 % ) , polychaete ( 11 % ) and echinoderm ( 6 % ) . In 1997 , the gastropod and crustacean had decreased to 13 % and 16 % respectively , while , polychaete had increased to 38 % becoming the mast dominant taxon . Bivalves and echinoderm also increased to 22 % and 11 % , respectively , in 1997 . The proliferative growth of C. racemosa imposed successional change on the macrofaunal assemblage in Moni Bay , Cyprus , between 1992 and 1997 . It remains to be tested whether the expansion of C. racemosa is related to the increase of water temperature associated with global warming or nutrient input or with the difference in the life history characteristic of this migrant vs. native algal specie .

aVThis paper present a simple method for incorporating the time required for new technology to penetrate the market and subsequently substitute for an old one when evaluating the ability of new energy technology to impact global climate change , The methodology is applied to the two largess source of energy-related carbon dioxide : electricity generation and motor vehicle . Carbon-free road transportation is hypothesized to substitute for petroleum-fueled vehicle and carbon-free electric power generation for fossil-fueled electricity based on empirical analog for substitution dynamic parameter , beginning in the year 2000 . The example imply that near-term significant reduction to 1990 carbon emission level via technology substitution are unlikely . The time scale relevant for realizing reduction in carbon emission is several time the expected lifetime of the product that new technology is intended to replace .

aVInsured weather loss in the US reached record high in the early 1990s , leading to major concern in the insurance industry about the cause , including the possibility of climate change due to global warming . Several study addressing the interpretation of the record high loss used historical insurance data set , those for crop-hail loss and others based on the catastrophic event to the property insurance industry , both covering the 1949-1995 period . The past loss value were adjusted by insurance expert for shifting coverage , inflation , and evolving construction practice . The resulting adjusted value of crop loss and costly catastrophe to property both showed similar distribution for 1949-1995 , with loss being high in the 1950s and again in the early 1990s . This distribution wa found to have a weak relationship with extra-tropical cyclone activity in the US , but most of the recent increase in weather loss to insured property wa found to be related to shifting societal factor that have put ever more property at risk in storm-prone area , including coastal area and large metropolitan area . The low property and crop storm loss of the 1966-1985 period had created an incorrect perception of the weather risk in the insurance industry , which did not understand nor appreciate the existence of the decadal-scale fluctuation that exist in climate condition .

aVThis study us a well-established water balance methodology to evaluate the relative impact of global warming and soil degradation due to desertification on future African water resource . Using a baseline climatology , a GCM global warming scenario , a newly derived soil water-holding capacity data set , and a worldwide survey of soil degradation between 1950 and 1980 , four climate and soil degradation scenario are created to simulate the potential impact of global warming and soil degradation on African water resource for the 2010-2039 time period . Results indicate that , on a continental scale , the impact of global warming will be significantly greater than the impact of soil degradation . However , when only considering the location where desertification is an issue ( wet and dry climate region ) , the potential effect of these two different human impact on local water resource can be expected to be on the same order of magnitude . Drying associated with global warming is primarily the result of increased water demand ( potential evapotranspiration ) across the entire continent . While there are small increase in precipitation under global warming condition , they are inadequate to meet the increased water demand . Soil degradation is most severe in highly populated , wet and dry climate region and result in decreased water-holding capacity in these location . This result in increased water surplus condition during wet season when the soil 's ability to absorb precipitation is reduced . At the same time , water deficit in these location increase because of reduced soil water availability in the dry season . The net result of the combined scenario is an intensification and extension of drought condition during dry season .

aVMolecular genetic study are revealing the presence of cryptic taxon , and pattern of gene flow in coral reef specie , that do not correspond to present day ocean circulation pattern . Concordant border of genetic inhomogeneity in several taxon emphasise the influence of historical barrier to gene flow . The persistence of genetic difference between site apparently connected by present-day current provides evidence for lack of effective contemporary gene exchange . A review of the limited data available to date can not be conclusive , but suggests that present pattern of genetic variation in the Indo-Pacific have resulted from highly pulsed dispersal event associated with range expansion during interglacial period . Thus , population genetic structure appears to be dominated by event associated with global climate change and sea level fluctuation during the last 1-3 million year , rather than vicariant geological event in the early Caenozoic , Regional speciation outside the tropical Indo-West Pacific and movement of these specie into that region may have played a more important role in producing diversity in that region than traditionally recognised . Some genetic variant have arisen before , and have persisted through , several cycle of climate change . The genetic structure of population is likely to have been maintained for several thousand year after they were first established , during or immediately after range expansion , by the occurrence of co-adapted gene complex of some form , and because of more limited opportunity for dispersal than ha been assumed to date .

aVClimate , the statistical description of weather including the probability for anomaly , change continuously , since both the interaction among the climate system component ( atmosphere , ocean , biosphere , cryosphere , and lithosphere ) and the irradiance of the sun vary on all timescales up to billion of year . On timescales which are of most interest for mankind , i.e . up to century , major factor causing climate variability are : changing composition of the atmosphere ; spectral solar irradiance variation ; systematic change of ocean-atmosphere-land interaction , if resulting in major change of ocean circulation ; volcanic eruption injecting mass into the low latitude stratosphere ( > 20 km height ) ; and land cover change modifying the surface energy budget . Two of these influencing factor are now largely anthropogenic , namely changing atmospheric condition and land cover change . Thus , the climate discussion ha become to a large extent one about anthropogenic influence . At different period , different influencing factor have been more important or dominant . Since the complex interaction are only partly understood , it is difficult to attribute observed climate parameter change or trend to particular cause . In this brief status report on global climate change , present knowledge is reviewed , mainly based on the second full assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .

aVAim Predictions of how the geographical range of specie change implicitly assume that range can be determined without invoking climate change . The aim here wa to determine how accurate prediction of range change might be before entertaining global climatic change . Location Worldwide . Methods All the documented global biological control translocation of ladybird ( Coccinellidae : Chilocorus spp . ) were analysed with the ecoclimatic program , CLIMEX . This program determines specie distribution in relation to climate , and can be used to express the favourableness of different locality for a specie . CLIMEX is also a useful exploratory tool for determining the likelihood of establishment of specie introduced from one area to another . Results Predictive model were developed based on the likelihood of establishment of fifteen Chilocorus spp . relative to their physiological characteristic and climatic tolerance . This likelihood wa compared with actual establishment with a resultant range of 0 % accuracy to 100 % accuracy . Only four ( 26.7 % ) specie climatic tolerance could the predicted with 100 % certainty . The general lack of accurate prediction wa because climate is not always the overriding feature determining whether a specie will establish or not . Other determinant , such a localized response to microclimate , phenology , host type and availability , presence of natural enemy and hibernation site play a varying role over and above climate in determining whether a specie will establish at a new locality . Main conclusion This study show that even in the absence of climate change , range can not always be determined , which mean that most prediction of range change with climate change are likely to be wrong .

aVCO2 emission which induce global warming , increase with the growth of the economic activity . It is , therefore , impossible to decrease emission only by energy saving and by improvement of the energy efficiency . Global CO2 recycling can solve this problem and supply abundant renewable energy . Global CO2 recycling consists of three district : ( i ) in desert , all necessary electricity are generated by solar cell ; ( ii ) on coast close to the desert , the electricity is used for production of H-2 by seawater electrolysis , H-2 is converted to CH4 by the reaction with CO2 and liquefied CH4 is transported to energy consuming district ; ( iii ) at energy consuming district , after CH4 is used a a fuel , CO2 is recovered , liquefied and transported to the coast close to the desert . A CO2 recycling plant for substantiation of our idea ha been built on the roof of our Institute ( IMR ) in 1996 , using key material tailored by u . The key material necessary for global CO2 recycling are the anode and cathode for seawater electrolysis and the catalyst for CO2 methanation . Since the quantity of CO2 to be converted far exceed an industrial level , the system must be very simple and the rate of conversion must be very fast . These requirement are satisfied in our global CO2 recycling system . When global CO2 recycling is conducted on a large scale , the energy and cost required to form liquefied CH4 in our global CO2 recycling system are almost the same a those for production of LNG from natural gas well . A project for field experimenting the global CO2 recycling using pilot plant in Egypt ha been planned in cooperation with Egyptian scientist , engineer and industry . ( C ) 1999 Elsevier Science S.A.

aVThe observation of temperature from meteorological network , a independent observation or indicator ( paleoclimatic , snow cover ; sea-ice and glacier extension , sea level ) , tend towards a surface global warming , which ha been more intense during the last decade . Several study converge on the attribution of part of the most recent warming to human activity . The El Nino event ( and it companion La Nina ) of climate variability , induces climate anomaly which can be distributed all over the globe . The forecasting of these event , several season in advance , became foreseeable a few year ago . These forecast , a climate change prediction , can be used a input to impact study on the occurrence and extension of infectious disease . It appears important that the corresponding methodology account for the uncertainty of the climatic forecast and prediction . ( C ) 1999 Elsevier , Paris .

aVA low-order physical-biogeochemical climate model wa used to project atmospheric carbon dioxide and global warming for scenario developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change . The North Atlantic thermohaline circulation weakens in all global warming simulation and collapse at high level of carbon dioxide . Projected change in the marine carbon cycle have a modest impact on atmospheric carbon dioxide . Compared with the control , atmospheric carbon dioxide increased by 4 percent at year 2100 and 20 percent at year 2500 . The reduction in ocean carbon uptake can be mainly explained by sea surface warming . The projected change of the marine biological cycle compensate the reduction in downward mixing of anthropogenic carbon , except when the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation collapse .

aVCertain concern about sustainable transportation derive from the premise that significant atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) and other greenhouse gas which contribute to global warming can be attributed to automotive emission . Among measure considered to curtail automobile dependency and increase transit modal split , `` full cost pricing '' - a mean of extracting both environmental cost and hidden subsidy which road user allegedly impose on society - ha emerged a an increasingly popular suggestion . This paper examines the potential impact of full cost pricing on the `` sustainability '' of urban transportation , using Toronto a a case study . The analysis deal with the direct effect on mode choice and vehicle utilization resulting from increased user cost a might be achieved through fuel tax or road pricing , a well a the indirect , longer term effect on location decision . To investigate the land-use impact , population distribution were altered to reflect more compact development and le urban sprawl a a proxy for relocation that might result from an increase in the cost of automobile use . Impacts are presented in term of change in total peak period vehicle-kilometres , mode split , and CO2 emission . Despite several qualification related to modelling technique used in the case study , the analysis suggests that , overall , the impact of large increase in road user cost appear to be le than proponent of full cost pricing would expect . In addition , the analysis suggests the fairly obvious , namely , that the greatest impact of pricing occur within those choice market where reasonable alternative to the private automobile actually exist .

aVThis study provides an integrated view of the growth pattern and factor that controlled the evolution of the Gulf of Cadiz continental margin based on study of the tectonic , sedimentologic and oceanographic history of the area . Seven sedimentary regime are identified , but there are more extensive description of the late Cenozoic regime because of the larger data base . The regime of the Mesozoic passive margin include carbonate platform , which become mixed calcareous-terrigenous deposit during the Late Cretaceous-early Tertiary . The Oligocene and Early Miocene terrigenous regime developed , in contrast , over the active and transcurrent margin near the African-Iberian plate boundary . The top of the Gulf of Cadiz olistostrome , emplaced in the Late Miocene , is used a a key horizon to define the 'post-orogenic ' depositional regime . The Late Miocene progradational margin regime is characterized by a large terrigenous sediment supply to the margin and coincides with the closing of the Miocene Atlantic-Mediterranean gateway . The terrigenous drift depositional regime of the Early Pliocene resulted from the occurrence of high eustatic sea level and the characteristic of the Mediterranean outflow current that developed after the opening of the Strait of Gibraltar . The Late Pliocene and Quaternary regime are dominated by sequence of deposit related to cycle of high and low sea level . Deposition of shelf-margin delta and slope wedge correlate with regressive and low sea level regime caused by eustasy and subsidence . During the highstand regime of the Holocene , inner shelf prograding delta and deep-water sediment drift were developed under the influence of the Atlantic inflow and Mediterranean outflow current , respectively . A modem human cultural regime began 2000 year ago with the Roman occupation of Iberia ; human cultural effect on sedimentary regime may have equalled natural factor such a climate change . Interplay of tectonic and oceanographic control dominated the evolution of the Cadiz margin during the Cenozoic . Depositional sequence formed where the tectonic setting provided the accommodation space and the shape of the deposit ha been greatly influenced by the strong unidirectional Atlantic inflow current on the shelf and Mediterranean outflow current on the slope . The entire cycle of the inflow and outflow deposition along the margin ha been controlled first by the tectonic evolution of the Betic and Rif gateway , which become closed during the Late Miocene , and after the Messinian by the opening of the Strait of Gibraltar . Strong current development during eustatic sea level highstands of the Pliocene and Quaternary ha controlled deposition because of maximum sill depth at Gibraltar for water circulation . Lowstand sea level slowed circulation and resulted in mud drape over the slope and regressive stratigraphic sequence over the shelf . More recently , the human industrial revolution ha caused heavy metal contamination of sediment and water over the Cadiz margin . Human activity also ha affected sedimentation rate because of deforestation that caused increased depositional rate near undammed river and decreased rate where river have been dammed . Future research effort will need to focus on : ( 1 ) the effect of increased Mediterranean outflow caused by river damming plus global warming and the increased outflow a a potential trigger for new ice age ; ( 2 ) assessment of geologic hazard for planning man-made shoreline structure , developing offshore petroleum resource and maintaining undersea communication cable ; and ( 3 ) confirmation of the general geologic history of the Cadiz margin .

aVFor the estimation of global climate change through analysis of the data from multiple satellite sensor , the intercalibration of the sensor is indispensable . In this paper , result of intercalibration of the newly developed VISSR for GMS-5 and NOAA-14 AVHRR are described . The method is based on collocated clear radiance observation with GMS-5 VISSR and NOAA-14 AVHRR . The result of the correlation analysis of the data of IR channel 1 and 2 of GMS-5 VISSR and those of channel 4 and 5 of NOAA-14 AVHRR indicate the following feature . The observed brightness temperature with IR channel 1 of VISSR is about 0.8K-1.5K colder than that with channel 4 of AVHRR , while that with IR channel 2 is about 0.1K-1.0K warmer than that with channel 5 of AVHRR . The result of adjustment on working spectral response function and atmospheric correction indicates that the adjusted brightness temperature with IR channel 1 and 2 of VISSR are about 1K colder than that with channel 4 and 5 of AVHRR . Thus this result show IR channel 1 and 2 on GMS-5 indicate a certain disagreement with channel 4 and 5 of NOAA-14 AVHRR . ( C ) 1999 COSPAR . Published by Elsevier Science Ltd .

aVThe reorganization of North American and European mammalian fauna across the Paleocene/Eocene boundary is attributed to intercontinental dispersal of higher-level taxon that originated in Asia . Hypotheses positing dispersal of these higher-level taxon from a Gondwanan source ( either Africa or the Indian subcontinent ) are rejected on the basis of their discordance with both phylogenetic and biostratigraphic data set . Because the only viable route for dispersal between Holarctic continent during the late Pareocene-early Eocene were land bridge located at high latitude , global climate change wa a decisive factor mediating the nature and timing of faunal interchange . Dispersal of higher-level taxon beyond Asia wa episodic and iterative , and seems to have occurred solely via Beringia . Because intercontinental dispersal of terrestrial taxon such a mammal rarely coincides precisely with their phylogenetic origin , geologically earlier first appearance of such taxon on their continent of origin are not unexpected . Given this paradigm , the Gashatan and Bumbanian Asian Land Mammal Ages ( ALMAs ) are likely to be older than is frequently conceived . At least some Bumbanian fauna , such a that from the Wutu Formation of Shandong Province , China , are correlated with the Clarkforkian North American Land Mammal Age ( NALMA ) , an interval that appears to be undocumented in the European record of mammalian evolution .

aVAdaption of technology for energy production with improved environmental performance is essential for supporting world economic growth and managing the global warming and climate change issue . International cooperation is critical to ensure the environmental and energy security of world economy on a global basis . For example , the USA ha acquired a great deal of useful experience in clean coal technology , which ha been demonstrated with major utility in commercial operation . The adoption and installation of clean coal technology should be given high priority worldwide . The continuous exchange of information and technology between developed and developing economy relating to current and fut4f great importance . Developed economy that posse environmentally responsive technology and financial resource should work closely with developing economy to facilitate technology transfer and trade of technology . Cooperation between economy can result in lowering the cast of deploying clean coal technology directed toward the clean production of energy . This paper discus a bilateral approach , i.e . the US/China Center for Energy and Environment , Co facilitate the mitigation of emission and promote the clean use of coal to satisfy growing energy demand in developing economy .

aVChanges in land use can affect soil organic matter content and fertility and also atmospheric CO2 concentration and global warming through soil respiration . We compared total and microbial C , N and P pool and C and N metabolism in sandy loam soil ( Typic Udivitrands ) under indigenous broadleaf-podocarp forest , grazed introduced pasture and 19-yr old Pinus radiata D. Don forest ( planted on previous pasture ) in New Zealand . Total and microbial C and N declined consistently with profile depth ( except for total N in L and FH sample ) , and in comparable depth of mineral soil ( to 20 cm ) tended to be lower in the pine than in the other system . Total P , organic P and extractable inorganic P concentration at comparable depth were , in contrast , lowest in the indigenous forest . Microbial P concentration did not differ significantly between the different system . Microbial C-to-microbial N ratio differed little among soil profile depth and ecosystem . In 0-10 cm depth mineral soil , CO2-C production , metabolic quotient ( qCO ( 2 ) value ) and net N mineralization were all highest in the pasture sample . Net nitrification wa high in the pine and pasture sample , but much lower in the indigenous forest sample ; nitrate-N wa , however , consistently present in streamwater from all three ecosystem . Changes in total C and microbial C and N pool on an area basis to 20 cm depth mineral soil were greatest after conversion of the indigenous forest to pasture ; total N content were , however , a high in the pasture a in the forest and net N mineralization wa highest in the pasture . On this area basis , change in total C content were small after conversion of pasture to pine , although the distribution within the soil profile did differ considerably between the pine and pasture system .

aVAim The community composition of benthic macroinvertebrates from 295 estuarine sire wa examined in order to either confirm or challenge established boundary of zoogeographical province . We also investigated the postulate that , while local distribution were determined by natural habitat characteristic such a salinity , sediment type and depth , distribution on a large geographical scale would bt : correlated with temperature . Location The Atlantic coast of the United States ( on a latitudinal gradient from 42 degree to 25 degree N ) . Methods Using the descriptive technique of cluster analysis and nonmetric multidimensional scaling , we determined the similarity in benthic community composition between site within 1 degree latitudinal band and compared the biotic ordination to natural habitat characteristic such a salinity , sediment type and depth . We then evaluated the overall community composition within each 1 degree latitudinal band and established whether or not similarity existed between adjacent 1 degree latitudinal band . In this manner , we were able to confirm that a latitudinal gradient existed in estuarine benthic community composition along the western Atlantic coast . This latitudinal gradient wa demarcated by biogeographical boundary at ( 1 ) Biscayne Bay , Florida , ( 2 ) the southern end of the Indian River Lagoon , Florida , ( 3 ) St John 's River , Florida , ( 4 ) Cape Island , South Carolina , ( 5 ) the mouth of the Cape Fear River , North Carolina . and ( 6 ) Caps God , Massachusetts , with 3 subprovince boundary just north of Cape May at Wildwood , New Jersey . Results The major division approximated widely recognized biogeographical boundary . Average summer water temperature correlated better than sediment type , depth , or salinity with the latitudinal grouping of site determined by cluster analysis . Conclusions Based on this relationship , we speculate on the potential impact of current global climate change scenario on the distribution of benthic macroinvertebrates along the western Atlantic coast .

aVAn adaptation of life-cycle assessment for contaminated site remediation activity wa used to examine a lead-contaminated site remediated by excavation and disposal . The study indicated emission and impact associated with energy consumption ( transportation of contaminated soil to hazardous and nonhazardous site ) , solid waste production ( contaminated soil and sludge ) , land use at four site ( the contaminated site , two disposal site , and a borrow pit for clean fill ) , and potential toxicity from emission and contaminant remaining on-site . These impact were drawn from an inventory compiled mainly from proprietary consultant ' report , and related to impact through several stressor-impact model ; the process-related indicator of global warming potential , solid waste burden , and ecological and human toxicity potential ; and site-related indicator of land use and residual human toxicity burden . Ecological and human toxicity potential were estimated using the Mackay level III model for southern Ontario , Canada , adapted for metal . The life-cycle approach proved useful for identifying potential impact occurring at local , regional , and global scale , over all activity and location affected by the remediation .

aVThe character and relative stratigraphic position of paleoclimatic indicator within Upper Mississippian stratum of southern West Virginia suggest a link between eustasy and pattern of continental- to global-scale atmospheric circulation . At the cyclothem scale , annual rhythm in marine facies , and paleovertisols and lacustrine carbonate in terrestrial unit indicate that seasonal , semiarid climatic condition prevailed during highstand progradation . In contrast , leached paleosols and coal that underlie sequence boundary and occur within transgressive heterolithic facies are suggestive of humid climatic condition during late highstand through early transgression . Milankovitch-band , glacial-interglacial cyclicity may explain both sequence development and the evidence for Late Mississippian climate fluctuation in the Appalachian : basin . Shifts from seasonal to humid climatic condition are attributed to systematic variation in monsoonal circulation , whereby seasonal moisture became restricted to the equatorial belt during the lowstands of each similar to 400 k.y . glacial-interglacial cycle .

aVTransoceanic migration of four specie of macrolepidoptera to subantarctic Macquarie Island ha been detected in 7 out of 33 year Juring the period 1962-96 and is restricted to spring and autumn . Analyses of synoptic chart during the migration period show that autumn immigrant originated from New Zealand and comprised a single specie of noctuid moth , Agrotis ipsilon ( Walker ) . Spring immigrant originated from Australia and comprised two noctuid , Dasypodia selenophora Guenee and Persectania ewingii Westwood and a butterfly , Vanessa kershawi ( McCoy ) . Autumn migration were associated with depression in the southern Tasman Sea . Spring migration were associated with the eastward passage of prefrontal airflow ahead of cold front which extended from southern Australia to the west of Macquarie Island . In an analysis of one of these event , wind exceeded 30 m ( -1 ) at 300 m altitude and could have transported migrant from Tasmania to Macquarie Island overnight in le than 10 h. Flight activity wa assisted by the presence of a nocturnal temperature inversion that maintained upper air temperature above 5 degree C. The effect of potential global warming on the migration and colonization of Macquarie Island by insect is discussed .

aVMethane is primarily a biogenic gas , which is implicated in global climate change . Among all the source of methane emission , paddy field form the most dominant source . An experiment wa conducted with a common paddy crop ( Oryza sativa var . Vishnuparag ) by amending the soil with different organic manure and biofertilizers with a view to find out an inexpensive strategy to mitigate methane emission from the rice-fields . The result revealed that there wa a seasonal change in the CH ( 4 ) flux , registering a peak at heading stage in all treatment . The application of rice straw before flooding and the biofertilizer after flooding enhances CH ( 4 ) efflux from the rice-fields significantly , while compost of cowdung and leaf did not stimulate CH ( 4 ) production and , rather , decreased CH ( 4 ) flux . As soil pH and temperature were optimum for methanogenesis , it wa likely that the organic C and the redox potential mainly modulated methane production and it emission through rice plant .

aVThe late Paleocene thermal maximum ( LPTM ) wa a dramatic , short-term global warming event that occurred similar to 55 Ma . Warming of high-latitude surface water and global deep water during the LPTM ha been well documented ; however , current data suggest that subtropical and tropical sea surface temperature ( SSTs ) did not change during the event . Conventional paradigm of global climate change , such a CO2-induced greenhouse warming , predict greater warming in the high latitude than in the tropic or subtropics but , nonetheless , can not account for the stable tropical/subtropical SSTs . We measured the stable isotope value of well-preserved late Paleocene to early Eocene planktonic foraminifera from South Atlantic Deep Sea Drilling Project ( DSDP ) Site 527 to evaluate the subtropical response to the climatic and environmental change of the LPTM . Planktonic foraminiferal delta ( 18 ) O value at Site 527 decrease by similar to 0.94 part per thousand from pre-LPTM to excursion value , providing the first evidence for subtropical warming during the LPTM . We estimate that subtropical South Atlantic SSTs warmed by at least similar to 1 degree - 4 degree C , on the basis of possible change in evaporation and precipitation . The new evidence for subtropical SST warming support a greenhouse mechanism for global warming involving elevated atmospheric CO2 level .

aVThe food system dominates anthropogenic disruption of the nitrogen cycle by generating excess fixed nitrogen . Excess fixed nitrogen , in various guise , augments the greenhouse effect , diminishes stratospheric ozone , promotes smog , contaminates drinking water , acidifies rain , eutrophies bay and estuary , and stress ecosystem . Yet , to date , regulatory effort to limit these disruption largely ignore the food system . There are many parallel between food and energy . Food is to nitrogen a energy is to carbon . Nitrogen fertilizer is analogous to fossil fuel . Organic agriculture and agricultural biotechnology play role analogous to renewable energy and nuclear power in political discourse . Nutrition research resembles energy end-use analysis . Meat is the electricity of food . As the agriculture and food system evolves to contain it impact on the nitrogen cycle , several lesson can be extracted from energy and carbon : ( i ) set the goal of ecosystem stabilization ; ( ii ) search the entire production and consumption system ( grain , livestock , food distribution , and diet ) for opportunity to improve efficiency ; ( iii ) implement cap and-trade system for fixed nitrogen ; ( iv ) expand research at the intersection of agriculture and ecology , and ( v ) focus on the food choice of the prosperous . There are important nitrogen-carbon link . The global increase in fixed nitrogen may be fertilizing the Earth , transferring significant amount of carbon from the atmosphere to the biosphere , and mitigating global warming . A modern biofuels industry someday may produce biofuels from crop residue or dedicated energy crop , reducing the rate of fossil fuel use , while loss of nitrogen and other nutrient are minimized .

aVIn last two year offshore wind energy is becoming a focal point of national and non national organization particularly after the limitation of fossil fuel consumption , adopted by many developed country after Kyoto conference at the end of 1997 on global climate change . North Europe is particularly interested in offshore for the limited land area still available , due to the intensive use of it territory and it today high wind capacity . Really the total wind capacity in Europe could increase from the 1997 value of 4450 MW up to 40 000 MW within 2010 , according the White Paper 1997 of the European Commission ; a significant percentage ( 25 % ) could be sited offshore up to 10 000 MW , because of close saturation of the land site at that time . World wind capacity could increase from the 1997 value of 7200 MW up to 60 000 MW within 2010 with a good percentage ( 20 % ) offshore 12 000 MW . In last seven year wind capacity is shallow water of coastal area ha reached 34 MW . Five wind farm are functioning in the internal sea of Netherlands , Denmark , Sweden ; however such siting is mostly to be considered a semi-offshore condition . Wind farm in real offshore site , open sea with wave and water depth over 10 m , are now proposed in North Sea at 10-20 km off the coast of Netherland , Denmark using large size wind turbine ( 1-2 MW ) . In 1997 an offshore proposal wa supported in Netherland by Greenpeace after the OWEMES '97 seminar , held in Italy on offshore wind in the spring 1997 . A review is presented in the paper of the European offshore wind program with trend in technology , economics and siting effect . ( C ) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All right reserved .

aVThe permafrost history of the high northern latitude over the last two million year indicates that perennially frozen ground formed and thawed repeatedly , probably in close synchronicity with the climate change that led to the expansion and subsequent shrinkage of continental ice sheet . The early stage of the Pleistocene are the least known and the change that occurred in the Late Pleistocene and early Holocene are the best known . Evidence that permafrost is degrading in response to the current global warming trend is difficult to ascertain . The dearest signal are probably provided by change in permafrost distribution in the sub-Arctic region , at the extreme southern fringe of the discontinuous permafrost zone .

aVMost climatic change predicted to occur in Brazil would reduce yield of silvicultural plantation , mainly through increased frequency and severity of drought brought on by global warming and by reduction of water vapor source in Amazonia caused by deforestation . Some additional negative effect could result from change in temperature , and positive effect could result from CO ( 2 ) enrichment . The net effect would be negative , forcing the country to expand plantation onto less-productive land , requiring increased plantation area land consequent economic loss ) out of proportion to the climatic change itself . These impact would affect carbon sequestration and storage consequence of any plan for subsidizing silviculture a a global warming mitigation option . Climate change can be expected to increase the area of plantation needed to supply projected internal demand for and export of end product from Brazil . June-July-August ( dry season ) precipitation reduction indicated by simulation reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) correspond to rainfall decline in this critical season of approximately 34 % in Amazonia , 39 % in Southern Brazil and 61 % in the Northeast . As an example , if rainfall in Brazilian plantation area ( most of which are now in Southern Brazil ) were to decline by 50 % , the area needed in 2050 would expand by an estimated 38 % over the constant climate case , bringing the total plantation area to 4.5 time the 1991 area . These large area of additional plantation imply substantial social and environmental impact . Further addition of plantation area a a global warming response option would augment these impact , indicating the need for caution in evaluating carbon sequestration proposal .

aVThe Ogallala or High Plains aquifer provides water for about 20 % of the irrigated land in the United States . About 20 km ( 3 ) ( 16.6 million acre-foot ) of water are withdrawn annually from this aquifer . In general , recharge ha not compensated for withdrawal since major irrigation development began in this region in the 1940s . The mining of the Ogallala ha been pictured a an analogue to climate change in that many GCMs predict a warmer and drier future for this region . In this paper we attempt to anticipate the possible impact of climate change on the sustainability of the aquifer a a source of water for irrigation and other purpose in the region . We have applied HUMUS , the Hydrologic Unit Model of the U.S. to the Missouri and Arkansas-White-Red water resource region that overlie the Ogallala . We have imposed three general circulation model ( GISS , UKTR and BMRC ) projection of future climate change on this region and simulated the change that may be induced in water yield ( runoff plus lateral flow ) and ground water recharge . Each GCM wa applied to HUMUS at three level of global mean temperature ( GMT ) to represent increasing severity of climate change ( a surrogate for time ) . HUMUS wa also run at three level of atmospheric CO2 concentration ( hereafter denoted by [ CO2 ] ) in order to estimate the impact of direct CO2 effect on photosynthesis and evapotranspiration . Since the UKTR and GISS GCMs project increased precipitation in the Missouri basin , water yield increase there . The BMRC GCM predicts sharply decreased precipitation and , hence , reduced water yield . Precipitation reduction are even greater in the Arkansas basin under BMRC a are the consequent water yield loss . GISS and UKTR climate lead to only moderate yield loss in the Arkansas . CO2-fertilization revers these loss and yield increase slightly . CO2 fertilization increase recharge in the base ( no climate change ) case in both basin . Recharge is reduced under all three GCMs and severity of climate change .

aVNumerical experiment have been carried out with a two-dimensional sector averaged global climate model in order to ass the potential impact of solar variability on the Earth 's surface temperature from 1700 to 1992 . This wa done by investigating the model response to the variation in solar radiation caused by the change in the Earth 's orbital element , a well a by the change intrinsic to the Sun . In the absence of a full physical theory able to explain the origin of the observed total solar irradiance variation , three different total solar irradiance reconstruction have been used . A total solar irradiance change due to the photospheric effect incorporated in the Willson and Hudson ( 1988 ) parameterization , and the newly reconstructed solar total irradiance variation from the solar model of Hoyt and Schatten ( 1993 ) and Lean et al . ( 1995 ) . Our result indicate that while the influence of the orbital forcing on the annual and global mean surface temperature is negligible at the century time scale , the monthly mean response to this forcing can be quite different from one month to another . The modelled global warming due to the three investigated total solar irradiance reconstruction is insufficient to reproduce the observed 20th century warming . Nevertheless , our simulated surface temperature response to the change in the Sun 's radiant energy output suggests that the Gleissberg cycle ( approximate to 88 year ) solar forcing should not be neglected in explaining the century-scale climate variation . Finally , spectral analysis seems to point out that the 10- to 12-year oscillation found in the recorded Northern Hemisphere temperature variation from 1700 to 1992 could be unrelated to the solar forcing . Such a result could indicate that the eleven-year period which is frequently found in climate data might be related to oscillation in the atmosphere or ocean , internal to the climate system .

aVAbove-ground dry biomass of living tree including palm wa estimated in 65 l ha plot spanning a 1000 km ( 2 ) landscape in central Amazonia . The study area wa located on heavily weathered , nutrient-poor soil that are widespread in the Amazon region . Biomass value were derived by measuring the diameter-at-breast-height ( DBH ) of all greater than or equal to 10 cm tree in each plot , then using an allometric equation and correction factor for small tree to estimate total tree biomass . Detailed information on soil texture , organic carbon , available water capacity , pH , macro- and micro-nutrients , and trace element wa collected from soil surface sample ( 0-20 cm ) in each plot , while slope wa measured with a clinometer . Biomass estimate varied more than two-fold , from 231 to 492 metric ton ha ( -1 ) , with a mean of 356 +/- 47 ton ha ( -1 ) . Simple correlation with stringent ( p < 0.006 ) Bonferroni correction suggested that biomass wa positively associated with total N , total exchangeable base , K+ , Mg2+ , clay , and organic C in soil , and negatively associated with Zn+ , aluminum saturation , and sand . An ordination analysis revealed one major and several minor soil gradient in the study area , with the main gradient discriminating site with varying proportion of clay ( with clayey soil having higher concentration of total N , organic C , most cation , and lower aluminum saturation and le sand ) . A multiple regression analysis revealed that the major clay-nutrient gradient wa the only significant predictor , with the model explaining 32.3 % of the total variation in biomass . Results of the analysis suggest that soil-fertility parameter can account for a third or more of the variation in above-ground biomass in Amazonian terra-firme forest . We suggest that , because the conversion of forest to pasture tends to reduce the nitrogen , clay , organic carbon , and nutrient content of soil , forest that regenerate on formerly cleared land may have lower biomass than the original forest , especially in area with low soil fertility .

aVChanges in precipitation and soil water availability predicted to accompany global climate change would impact grassland , where many ecosystem process are influenced by water availability . Soil biota , including microarthropods , also are affected by soil water content , although little is known about how climate change might affect their abundance and distribution . The goal of this study wa to examine soil microarthropod response to altered soil water availability in tallgrass prairie ecosystem . Two separate experiment were done . The first utilized control and irrigated plot along a topographic gradient to examine the effect of soil water content on microarthropod density . Microarthropods , mainly Acari , were significantly le abundant in irrigated plot and were generally le abundant at the wetter lowland site . The second study utilized reciprocal core transplant across an east-west regional precipitation gradient . Large , intact core were transplanted between a more mesic tallgrass site ( Konza Prairie ) and a more arid mixed-grass site ( Hays ) to determine the effect of different soil water regime on microarthropod abundance and vertical distribution . Data from non-transplanted core indicated greater total microarthropod density at the drier Hays site , relative to the wetter Konza Prairie site . Data from the transplanted core indicated significant effect of location on Acari density in core originating from Hays , with higher density in core remaining at Hays , relative to those transplanted to Konza . Acari density in core originating from Konza were not affected by location ; however , oribatid mite density generally were greater in core remaining at Konza Prairie . These result confirm the importance of soil water content in affecting microarthropod density and distribution in grassland , and suggest complex , non-linear response to change in water availability .

aVThis study is concerned with interaction between a boreal forest ecosystem and the atmosphere , measured in an old-growth muskeg ecosystem ( predominantly black spruce Picea mariana ) in the BOREAS Southern study area ( SSA ) , Saskatchewan , Canada , during 1996 . We focus on effort to understand the net ecosystem exchange of CO2 in term of the sub-component flux operating within the ecosystem . The component flux of primary interest are photosynthesis , respiration and evapotranspiration of foliage , and the efflux of CO2 from the forest floor . Woody biomass respiration is also considered . Methodologies were developed to study these flux on a continuous basis . An `` open '' system gas exchange chamber for measuring soil CO2 efflux wa designed that eliminated the major problem that have been associated with this methodology in the past . The system wa used to investigate temporal and spatial variation in soil CO2 efflux at the field site . A scheme that integrated this temporal and spatial variation wa used to estimate the CO2 efflux from the forest floor for an entire year . Seasonally , soil CO2 efflux varied between low , but positive , rate before the springtime thaw and after the winter freeze , to rate a high a 14 mu mol m ( -2 ) s ( -1 ) in late summer . The total carbon efflux from the soil during the measurement period varied from point to point between 152 and 1310 g ( C ) m ( -2 ) yr ( -1 ) , the total soil carbon efflux for the whole ecosystem over the measurement period wa estimated to be 790 g ( C ) m ( -2 ) yr ( -1 ) . A `` branch bag '' methodology for studying the gas exchange of whole tree branch wa developed and operated for an entire growing season . Daily maximum photosynthetic rate were zero at the beginning and end of the year and reached a maximum of approximate to 6 mu mol m ( -2 ) s ( -1 ) . Night-time respiration reached a maximum rate of approximate to 0.8 mu mol g ( -1 ) s ( -1 ) . Total daytime carbon uptake during the measurement period ranged from 12.6 to 22.6 mol m ( -2 ) ( leaf area ) yr ( -1 ) for individual branch and total night-time loss ranged from 1.98 to 2.27 mol kg ( -1 ) ( dry weight ) yr ( -1 ) . Total net photosynthesis for the canopy during the measurement period wa estimated to be 919 g ( C ) m ( -2 ) ( ground area ) yr ( -1 ) . Above-ground autotrophic respiration in woody tissue during the measurement period wa estimated to be 89 g ( C ) m ( -2 ) y ( -1 ) . In 1996 , the estimated net carbon uptake during the measurement period for the ecosystem wa 222 g ( C ) m ( -2 ) yr ( -1 ) . This wa the small difference between a large photosynthetic influx and a large respiratory efflux . The carbon source/sink strength of this ecosystem is thus very sensitive to change in environmental condition , and the boreal region may be the location of a large positive feedback on global climate change .

aVIn addition to long-term benefit of greenhouse gas ( GHG ) reduction in the form of avoided health and ecosystem damage , there are important near-term benefit resulting from the reduction in health-damaging pollutant ( HDP ) that can accompany GHG reduction . This paper estimate such health benefit , using the power and household energy sector of China a a case study for the method . Four policy scenario were compared : business a usual , least-cost energy efficiency , least-cost per unit global-warming-reduction fuel substitution , and least-cost per unit exposure-reduction fuel substitution . The health benefit were estimated by converting PM10 emission first to human exposure and then to avoided mortality and morbidity with existing exposure-response relationship . Our result demonstrate that the near-term health benefit from GHG reduction in China could be substantial but are highly dependent on the technology and sector chosen . Such near-term benefit provide the opportunity for a true `` no-regrets '' GHG reduction policy . The result of this study also have important implication for the current international negotiation to cut GHG emission by demonstrating that GHG reduction strategy can have substantial local and national a well a global benefit .

aVGreenhouse gas mitigation option help in reducing greenhouse gas emission so a to avoid the adverse environmental impact due to global warming/climate change . They have different characteristic when evaluated using different criterion . For example , some option may be very cost effective , while some may have an additional advantage of reducing local pollution . Hence , selection of these option , for consideration by a national government or by a funding agency , ha to incorporate multiple criterion . In this paper , some important criterion relevant to the selection are discussed , and a multi-criteria methodology is suggested for making appropriate selection . The methodology , called the Analytic Hierarchy Process , is described using two illustration . ( C ) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All right reserved .

aVPrevious empirical observation on thermocline response to warmer condition have been contradictory . Given that a deepening thermocline wa observed for a small lake ( 0.5 km ( 2 ) ) and a shallowing thermocline wa observed for a larger system ( 73.6 km ( 2 ) ) , these contradiction may be attributable to difference in lake size and the diminishing influence of water clarity on mixing depth . The four basin system of Lake Opeongo , Ontario , Canada , range in size from 4.4 to 22.1 km ( 2 ) and build an empirical suite of stratification response to climate variation for a wide range of lake size . From 1958 to 1996 , lake temperature profile were taken in the four major basin of Lake Opeongo . Canonical correlation analysis linked earlier iceout date , warm July-August air temperature , and relatively high amount of bright sunshine in July and August with warmer midsummer epilimnia and shallower midsummer thermoclines for all four basin . The occurrence of stratification pattern associated with warmer climatic condition increased ( r = 0.44 , p < 0.01 ) in parallel with the recent ( post-1965 ) global warming trend . Such pattern also tended to occur in El Nino year . Stratification condition with cooler midsummer epilimnia and deeper thermoclines tended to occur in La Nina year and provided a pronounced signal in 1992 , the year that experienced a global cooling effect due to the eruption of Mount Pinatubo .

aVArctic terrestrial ecosystem are strongly dominated by temperature , and global warming is expected to have a particularly strong impact in high latitude . The Arctic will therefore be an important region for early detection of global change . In the present study the effect of environmental manipulation simulating climate change on soil microorganism and nematode population were investigated . Study site were a dwarf shrub dominated tree-line heath ( 450 m a.s.l . ) and a high altitude fellfield ( 1150 m a.s.l . ) at Abisko , Swedish Lapland . Soil temperature wa enhanced by using passive greenhouse and the impact on soil organism with and without NPK fertilizer addition wa assessed . The nematode community wa strongly affected by warming and nutrient application . Population density wa twice a high for all treatment at the fellfield a compared to control . At the heath temperature enhancement with or without fertilizer application also led to a doubling of the population density , whereas fertilization alone caused an increase of about one third . The environmental manipulation resulted in a greater microbial biomass C and active fungal biomass in the heath soil . Increased density wa also recorded for bacterial and fungal feeding nematode at both site . The result suggest that nematode have an important impact on microbial biomass and turnover rate in the two subarctic system . Elevated soil temperature apparently will lead to increased grazing on microorganism , contributing to enhanced net N and P mineralization rate and plant nutrient availability . However , biodiversity wa generally affected negatively by the environmental manipulation . The effect were more severe at the high altitude fellfield indicating that the influence of elevated temperature will be more pronounced in system already stressed by extreme climatic condition .

aVThis paper emphasizes some general aspect of soil protozoa a indicator of environmental quality-pros and con , method , and diversity . Protozoa are at the base of the heterotrophic eukaryotic food web and an essential component in marine , freshwater , and soil ecosystem because they consume a significant portion ( usually > 50 % ) of the bacterial productivity . enhancing nutrient cycle and energy flow to the benefit of microorganism , plant and animal . Accordingly , study of their dynamic and community structure provide a powerful mean for assessing and monitoring change in the biotic and abiotic environment . This is exemplified by some representative study focusing on soil oxygen regime , differentiation of humus type , pesticide , global warming , forest decline , movement of protozoan pathogen in soil , and soil protozoan bioassay . Usually , protozoa are not replaceable by higher animal ( meso- and macrofauna ) a indicator organism because they have unique physiological property : they consume more food and have a higher respiration rate per mass unit , have shorter generation and life time , and reproduce much faster . Direct counting method should be given preference over dilution culture technique , which are beset with uncontrollable deficiency . Thus , ciliate and , especially , testate amoeba , whose abundance and diversity can be reliably estimated in simple soil suspension , should be preferred in environmental study . About 1600 protozoan specie are known to live in terrestrial habitat . However , data from study of ciliate suggest that this is only a minor portion ( 20-30 % ) of the specie actually present , most of which are still undescribed . Overcoming the methodological and taxonomic problem are urgent need which , at present , limit the use of protozoa a bioindicators in terrestrial environment . Furthermore , specie monograph are required to compile the taxonomic , faunistic , and ecological information available . ( C ) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All right reserved .

aVElevated soil temperature may increase C loss from soil by accelerating microbial respiration and dissolved organic C leaching . We evaluated the effect of elevated soil temperature on C loss from a forest Spodosol by incubating soil core from surface ( Oa + A + E ) and subsurface ( Bhs ) horizon at two seasonal temperature regime . One regime simulated the normal course of soil temperature in northern lower Michigan , and the other simulated soil temperature representing an amount of warming that might occur under some global warming theory calculation . We measured the amount of CO2-C respired and dissolved organic C leached from the soil core during a 33-wk period . Microbial respiration rate , after adjustment for variation in initial rate , were significantly increased by soil warming and were greater in surface than in subsurface horizon . Warming significantly increased cumulative C respired , with greater loss from surface soil ( greater than or equal to 50 mg C g ( -1 ) C ) a compared with subsurface soil ( le than or equal to 25 mg C g ( -1 ) C ) . Mean quantity of dissolved organic C leached , ranging from 2.3 to 3.2 mg C g ( -1 ) C , did not differ significantly by soil horizon or temperature regime . Increased microbial respiration in surface soil horizon wa the process most responsive to soil warming in the Spodosol sample we examined . Whether this is a short-term effect that would disappear once pool of labile C are exhausted , or represents a long-term response to soil warming , remains uncertain .

aVRemarkable global climate oscillation were recorded during the timespan middle Carboniferous-Triassic , which allows definition of two cold ( icehouse 1 : middle Carboniferous ; icehouse 2 : early Permian ) and two warm episode ( greenhouse 1 : late Carboniferous - earliest Permian ; greenhouse 2 : middle Permian - Triassic ) . The tectonic evolution of the central Pangean realm from Variscan to late Variscan , and finally to early Alpine offer an explanation for these climate oscillation , in term of mountain building , extensional collapse , rifting , epeirogeny , volcanism , erosion , and exhumation . The cold period were associated with orogenic ( icehouse 1 ) or epeirogenic ( icehouse 2 ) movement leading to uplift and erosion , and therefore , to CO2 output from the atmosphere . On the contrary , the warm period were related to extension-related phenomenon , such a volcanism , deep- and shallow-seated hydrothermal activity , unroofing of large-scale metamorphic core-complexes ( greenhouse 1 ) , or vast exhumation of coal and pear deposit and volcanism ( greenhouse 2 ) , all of them process leading to massive input of CO2 into the atmosphere , hence , to global warming .

aVDisposal of anthropogenic CO2 in the ocean ha been considered a a method to counteract global warming . A desirable method of the ocean disposal is to convert the le dense liquefied CO2 into denser CO2 hydrate via a submerged hydrate crystallizer at a depth < 500 m. The fate of CO2 hydrate in the ocean ha been investigated . It is shown in this study that hydrate particle released in the ocean are physicochemically unstable ; however , hydrate decomposition occurs only a a surface phenomenon . Because CO2 hydrate is denser than seawater , hydrate particle will sink in the ocean . During the descending process , the hydrate particle dissolve gradually in seawater owing to decomposition occurring continuously at surface of hydrate particle . This dissolution fate of CO2 hydrate in the ocean is significantly different from the previous prediction that the disposed CO2 hydrate would exist a a long-lasting entity in the ocean .

Large , multi-reservoir system ( Columbia River , Missouri River , Apalachicola-Chatahoochee-Flint ( ACF ) Rivers ) , small , one or two reservoir system ( Tacoma and Boston ) and medium size system ( Savannah River ) are represented . The river basin range from mountainous to low relief and semi-humid to semi-arid , and the system operational purpose range from predominantly municipal to broadly multi-purpose . The study inferred , using a chain of climate downscaling , hydrologic and water resource system model , the sensitivity of six water resource system to change in precipitation , temperature and solar radiation . The climate change scenario used in this study are based on result from transient climate change experiment performed with coupled ocean-atmosphere General Circulation Models ( GCMs ) for the 1995 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) assessment . An earlier doubled-CO2 scenario from one of the GCMs wa also used in the evaluation . The GCM scenario were transferred to the local level using a simple downscaling approach that scale local weather variable by fixed monthly ratio ( for precipitation ) and fixed monthly shift ( for temperature ) . For those river basin where snow play an important role in the current climate hydrology ( Tacoma , Columbia , Missouri and , to a lesser extent , Boston ) change in temperature result in important change in seasonal streamflow hydrographs . In these system , spring snowmelt peak are reduced and winter flow increase , on average . Changes in precipitation are generally reflected in the annual total runoff volume more than in the seasonal shape of the hydrographs . In the Savannah and ACF system , where snow play a minor hydrological role , change in hydrological response are linked more directly to temperature and precipitation change . Effects on system performance varied from system to system , from GCM to GCM , and for each system operating objective ( such a hydropower production , municipal and industrial supply , flood control , recreation , navigation and instream flow protection ) . Effects were generally smaller for the transient scenario than for the doubled CO2 scenario . In term of streamflow , one of the transient scenario tended to have increase at most site , while another tended to have decrease at most site . The third showed no general consistency over the six site . Generally , the water resource system performance effect were determined by the hydrologic change and the amount of buffering provided by the system 's storage capacity . The effect of demand growth and other plausible future operational consideration were evaluated a well . For most site , the effect of these non-climatic effect on future system performance would about equal or exceed the effect of climate change over system planning horizon .

aVUpper air observation from radiosondes and microwave satellite instrument doe not indicate any global warming during the last 19 year , contrary to surface measurement , where a warming trend is supposedly being found . This result is somewhat difficult to reconcile , since climate model experiment do indicate a reverse trend , namely , that upper tropospheric air should warm faster than the surface . To contribute toward an understanding of this difficulty , we have here undertaken some specific experiment to study the effect on climate due to the decrease in stratospheric ozone and the Mount Pinatubo eruption in 1991 . The associated forcing wa added to the forcing from greenhouse gas , sulfate aerosol ( direct and indirect effect ) , and tropospheric ozone , which wa investigated in a separate series of experiment . Furthermore , we have undertaken an ensemble study in order to explore the natural variability of an advanced climate model exposed to such a forcing over 19 year . The result show that the reduction of stratospheric ozone cool not only the lower stratosphere but also the troposphere , in particular , the upper and middle part . In the upper troposphere the cooling from stratospheric ozone lead to a significant reduction of greenhouse warming . The modeled stratospheric aerosol from Mount Pinatubo generate a climate response ( stratospheric warming and tropospheric cooling ) in good agreement with microwave satellite measurement . Finally , analysis of a series of experiment with both stratospheric ozone and the Mount Pinatubo effect show considerable variability in climate response , suggesting that an evolution having no warming in the period is a likely a another evolution showing modest warming . However , the observed trend of no warming in the midtroposphere and clear warming at the surface is not found in the mode ! simulation .

aVMarine intertidal organism are subjected to a variety of abiotic stress , including aerial exposure and wide range of temperature . Intertidal specie generally have higher thermal tolerance limit than do subtidal specie , and tropical specie have higher thermal tolerance limit than do temperate specie . The adaptive significance of upper thermal tolerance limit of intertidal organism , however , ha not been examined within a compar- ative context . Here , we present a comparative analysis of the adaptive significance of upper thermal tolerance limit in 20 congeneric specie of porcelain crab , genus Petrolisthes , from intertidal and subtidal habitat throughout the eastern Pacific . Upper thermal tolerance limit are positively correlated with surface water temperature and with maximal microhabitat temperature . Analysis of phylogenetically independent contrast ( from a phylogenetic tree on the basis of the 16 rDNA gene sequence ) suggests that upper thermal tolerance limit have evolved in response to maximal microhabitat temperature . Upper thermal tolerance limit increased during thermal acclimation at elevated temperature , the amount of increase being greater for subtidal than for intertidal specie . This result suggests that the upper thermal tolerance limit of some intertidal specie may be near current habitat temperature maximum , and global warming thus may affect the distribution limit of intertidal specie to a greater extent than for subtidal specie .

aVHydrological process in high altitude mountainous region differ from those in more temperate region , primarily due to such influence a cold temperature , large and rapid change in surface energy balance during snowmelt , a long period at low-temperature environmental condition and the existence of permafrost . A physically based , semi-distributed water balance model to quantitatively simulate the hydrological process and stream flow , a well a to estimate the potential consequence of projected global warming on stream Row for such high altitude mountainous region wa constructed . Distributed meteorological data from the interpolation of the point measurement by mean of a digital elevation model ( DEM ) of the basin , such a air temperature , precipitation , snowfall ratio , wind speed , etc. , have been used a model input . Several other hydrological parameter , such a soil moisture content and evapotranspiration , which are essential in simulation of river runoff in a water balance state , were estimated by the combination of Landsat TM and a DEM with the utilization of the distributed meteorological data . The model us only a few crucial parameter for calibration , and the model structure is based upon estimating the stream flow component . Simulated result of spatially distributed soil moisture content , evapotranspiration and monthly discharge yield reasonable agreement , both spatially and temporally , to the field observation or the estimated result by the other approach . This physically based model ha the potential to project stream flow under the possible climate scenario . Copyright ( C ) 2000 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd .

aVNitrous oxide ( N ( 2 ) O ) is a greenhouse gas , the third most significant contributor to global warming . As a key process for N ( 2 ) O elimination from the biosphere , N ( 2 ) O reductase catalyze the two-electron reduction of N ( 2 ) O to N ( 2 ) . These 2 x 65 kDa copper enzyme are thought to contain a CuA electron entry site , similar to that of cytochrome c oxidase , and a CuZ catalytic center . The copper anomalous signal wa used to solve the crystal structure of N ( 2 ) O reductase from Pseudomonas nautica by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion , to a resolution of 2.4 Angstrom . The structure reveals that the CuZ center belongs to a new type of metal cluster , in which four copper ion are liganded by seven histidine residue . N ( 2 ) O bind to this center via a single copper ion . The remaining copper ion might act a an electron reservoir , assuring a fast electron transfer and avoiding the formation of dead-end product .

aVAim Fagus grandifolia var . mexicana ( Martinez ) Little ha an extraordinarily restricted distribution in the Mexican montane cloud forest . Isolated Fagus ( beech ) population have been recorded in le than 10 small area ( 2-40 ha ) in the eastern Sierra Madre at altitude from 1400 to 2000 m. The objective were to determine tree and seedling age , forest structure , phenology , litterfall pattern and the relationship between mast and climatic variable . Location We report on three Fagus stand at the Acatlan Volcano , Veracruz , Mexico . Methods Changes in forest cover were determined using aerial photograph . Within each stand , basal area , density and tree specie composition were determined in a 0.1-ha band transect . Additionally , litterfall production wa quantified and phenophases were recorded monthly over a 3-year period , and 60 tree core were collected to determine age distribution and tree-ring growth . Results The forest wa atypical in several respect . Fagus wa the only dominant tree specie in the crater stand , although in the rim and at the top of the volcano it wa codominant with other tree specie . Juveniles occurred only on the rim , but there wa a seedling bank in the crater . Although forest cover in the area increased between 1968 and 1993 , the Fagus stand did not change in size . Leaf production peaked in March and April , and leaf fail occurred from October through February . Litterfall production wa the highest in November . During mast year , flowering started in February and between mast event there were no flower or fruit . Minimum temperature were highly correlated with Fagus litterfall and leaf fall . Seedlings ranged in age from 2 to 18 year and were 13-60 cm tall . Tree core ranged from 76 to 120 year , but tree were older than the core sample . Main conclusion Although beech is considered a gap regeneration specie that reach the canopy after alternating period of release and suppression , the tree in the crater were released when le than 1.5 m tall and have suffered few period of suppression since . The result indicate that the crater stand wa established after a severe disturbance destroyed the existing forest . We conclude that the relict beech population should be able to maintain itself , if not severely disturbed by human or by climatic change related to global warming .

aVThe author develop a coupled atmosphere-ocean-sea ice-land surface : model for long-term climate change study that incorporates the seasonal cycle . Three ocean basin . the Antarctic Circumpolar Current region , and the major continent are resolved . The model variable are sectorially averaged across the different ocean basin and continent . The atmosphere is represented by an energy-moisture balance model in which the meridional energy and moisture transport are parameterized by a combination of advection and diffusion process . The zonal heat transport between land and ocean obeys a diffusion law , while the zonal moisture transport is parameterized so that the ocean always supply moisture to the land . The ocean model is due to Wright and Stocker , and the sea ice model is a zero-layer thermodynamic one in which the ice thickness and concentration are predicted by the method of Semtner and Hibler , respectively . In the land surface model , the temperature is predicted by an energy budget equation , similar to Ledley 's , while the soil moisture and river runoff are predicted by Manabe 's bucket model . The above model component are coupled together using flux adjustment in order to first simulate the present day climate . The major feature of this simulation are consistent with observation and the general result of GCMs . However , it is found that a diffusive law for heat and moisture transport five better result in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere . Sensitivity experiment , show that in a global warming ( cooling ) experiment , the thermohaline circulation ( THC ) in the North Atlantic Ocean is weakened ( intensified ) due to the increased ( reduced ) moisture transport to the northern high latitude and the warmer ( cooler ) SST at northern high latitude . Last , the coupled model is employed to investigate the initiation of glaciation by slowly reducing the solar radiation and increasing the planetary emissivity , only in the northern high latitude . When land ice is growing , the THC in the North Atlantic Ocean is intensified , resulting in a warm subpolar North Atlantic Ocean . which is in agreement with the observation of Ruddiman and McIntyre . The intensified THC maintains a large land-ocean thermal contrast at high latitude and hence enhances land ice accumulation , which is consistent with the rapid ice sheet growth during the first 10 kyr of the last glacial period that wa observed by Johnson and Andrews . The author conclude that a cold climate is not responsible for a weak ol collapsed THC in the North Atlantic Ocean : rather it is suggested that increased freshwater or massive iceberg discharge from land is responsible for such a state .

aVThe relative stimulation of photosynthesis by elevated carbon dioxide in C-3 specie normally increase strongly with increasing temperature . This result from the kinetic characteristic of Rubisco , and ha potentially important implication for response of vegetation to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide . It is often assumed that because Rubisco characteristic are conservative , all C-3 specie have the same temperature dependence of the response of photosynthesis to elevated carbon dioxide . However , in this field study of Taraxacum officinale , there were no significant difference in the relative stimulation of photosynthesis by elevated carbon dioxide among day with temperature ranging from 15 to 34 degreesC . Nevertheless , short-term measurement indicated a strong temperature dependence of the stimulation . This suggested that acclimation to temperature caused the lack of variation in the seasonal data . Experiments in controlled environment indicated that complete acclimation of the relative stimulation of photosynthesis by elevated carbon dioxide occurred for growth temperature of 10 - 25 degreesC . The apparent specificity of Rubisco for carbon dioxide relative to oxygen at 15 degreesC , a assayed in vivo by measurement of the carbon dioxide concentration at which carboxylation equalled oxygenation , also varied with growth temperature . Changes in the apparent specificity of Rubisco accounted for the acclimation of the temperature dependence of the relative stimulation of photosynthesis by elevated carbon dioxide . It is premature to conclude that low temperature will necessarily reduce the relative stimulation of photosynthesis caused by rising atmospheric carbon dioxide .

aVPlants respond to Pleistocene climatic change a specie , not a association or biome . This ha been demonstrated unequivocally by paleobotanical data for temperate latitude . In the far richer vegetation of the tropic specie population also fluctuated independently in response to climatic forcing , from their longlasting glacial state to the pattern of brief interglacials like the present and back again . We use pollen data to reconstruct the vegetation of the Amazon basin in oxygen isotope stage 3 and 2 of the last glaciation in order to measure how the plant population of the Amazon responded to the global warming at the onset of the Holocene . We find that plant community of the neotropics vent copious pollen to lake sediment and that this pollen yield powerful signal for community composition . Three continuous sedimentary record reaching through oxygen isotope stage 2 are available from the Amazon lowland , those from Carajas , Lake Pata and marine deposit off the mouth of the Amazon River . All three record yield pollen history of remarkable constancy and stability . By comparing them with deposit of equal antiquity from the cerrado ( savanna ) of central Brazil , we show that most of the Amazon lowland remained under forest throughout a glacial cycle . This forest wa never fragmented by open vegetation a postulated by the refugia hypothesis . Instead the intact forest of glacial time included significant population of plant that are now montane , suggesting that the global warming of the early Holocene resulted in the expulsion of heat intolerant plant from the lowland forest . Pollen data from the Amazonian flank of the Andes and from Pacific Panama provide evidence that population of these heat intolerant plant survive the heat of interglacials in part by maintaining large population at cooler montane altitude . Our conclusion that the Amazon lowland were forested in glacial time specifically refutes the hypothesis of Amazonian glacial aridity . Accordingly we examine the geomorphological evidence for glacial aridity and find it wanting . Of the three paleodune system reported for tropical South America , that of NE Brazil wa active in the Holocene a well a the Pleistocene . Parts of NE Brazil were actually moister than now in late-glacial time . Paleodunes in the Pantanal have never been seen on the ground , and those in the Orinoco Llanos are undated and may bie of any age since the Tertiary . Arkosic sand in the Amazon fan deposit came from the Andean foothill or from down cutting by river and can not be evidence of a former arid land surface . White sand of Amazonia formed a podzol , not by aeolian activity . Such Amazonian stone line a have received critical scrutiny are concretionary pisolites in stratigraphic formation that are more than ten million year old . Although the Amazon wa never arid , modeling cooler glacial tropic give plausibility to a somewhat drier Amazon in glacial time , a concept given substance by pollen data for the movement of ecotones in Rondonia , by stream history in the Bolivian Andes , and by evidence for lowered lake level at Carajas and Lake Pata . But this reduced precipitation wa never enough to fragment the forest in the Amazon lowland themselves . Pleistocene mammal of the Napo river valley in Ecuador were able to live along the river system in a forested landscape . Our data suggest that the Amazon forest have been stable since the start of the Pleistocene , a fact that ha contributed to the storage of vast diversity . The coming anthropogenic global warming and CO2 enrichment will add to the global warming already endured by Amazon biota in the Holocene . We think it possible that the expulsion from the lowland forest of heat intolerant specie is already complete and that the forest property of maintaining it own microhabitat will allow the high specie richness to survive more global warming , provided large enough tract of forest are preserved .

aVOver vast area of the world 's landmass , where climate beat out a strong seasonal rhythm , tree growth keep unerring time . In their ring , tree record many climate melody , played in different place and different era . Recent year have seen a consolidation and expansion of tree-ring sample collection across the traditional research area of North America and Europe , and the start of major development in many new area of Eurasia , South America and Australasia . From such collection are produced network of precisely dated chronology ; record of various aspect of tree growth , registered continuously , year by year across many century . Their sensitivity to different climate parameter are now translated into ever more detailed history of temperature and moisture variability across expanding dimension of time and space . With their extensive coverage , high temporal resolution and rigid dating control , dendroclimatic reconstruction contribute significantly to our knowledge of late Holocene climate , most importantly on timescales ranging from 1 to 100 year . In special area of the world , where tree live for thousand of year or where subfossil remnant of long dead specimen are preserved , work building chronology covering many millennium continues apace . Very recently , tree have provided important new information about major mode of general circulation dynamic linked to the El Nino/Southern Oscillation and the North Atlantic Oscillation , and about the effect of large volcanic eruption . As for assessing the significance of 20th century global warming , the evidence from dendroclimatology in general , support the notion that the last 100 year have been unusually warm , at least within a context of the last two millennium . However , this evidence should not be considered equivocal . The activity of human may well be impacting on the 'natural ' growth of tree in different way , making the task of isolating a clear climate message subtly difficult .

aVSince CFC 11 wa eliminated from use in rigid foam in the mid 1990s , the blowing agent of choice in North America ha primarily been HCFC 141b . In the USA , we are now faced with the phase-out of HCFC 141b by the year 2003 . The blowing agent that will replace HCFC 141b must be non-ozone depleting and should also have low thermal conductivity and a low global warming potential . Hydrocarbons are some of the few blowing agent that meet these criterion and are approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency to replace HCFC 141b in rigid polyurethane foam for appliance insulation [ 1 ] . Of the hydrocarbon being considered , cyclopentane is preferred , either by itself or in blend with other hydrocarbon . This is because of cyclopentane 's favorable combination of low thermal conductivity , good solubility in polyols and reasonable boiling point , compared to other hydrocarbon . Not only is the thermal conductivity of cyclopentane lower than that of most other hydrocarbon , it is also lower than that of HFC 134a , another blowing agent which is approved for use after 2002 . This paper will examine the effect of two important factor , both theoretically and experimentally , on cyclopentane blown foam . These factor are ( 1 ) the amount of blowing obtained from carbon dioxide that is formed from the reaction between water and isocyanate , and ( 2 ) the ratio of cyclopentane to isopentane , which is used a the hydrocarbon blowing agent .

aVAccurate estimate of the retention of carbon in forest soil following forest disturbance are essential to prediction of global carbon cycling . The belief that 50 % of soil carbon is lost in the first 20 year after clearcutting is largely based on a chronosequence study of forest floor in New Hampshire northern hardwood ( Covington , 1981 ) . We resampled forest floor in 13 stand in a similar chronosequence after an interval of 15 year . The three youngest stand , which were predicted to lose organic matter over this time , did not exhibit the 40-50 % loss predicted by the original chronosequence . The oldest stand had about twice a much organic mass in the forest floor a those cut recently , but this pattern could be explained equally well by historical change in the nature of forest harvest a by the age of the stand . For example , mechanized logging probably cause more mechanical disturbance to the forest floor than horse logging , burying more organic matter into the mineral soil . Markets for forest product and the intensity of harvest removal have also changed over time , possibly contributing to lower organic matter in the forest floor in young stand . In any chronosequence study , effect of change in the nature of the treatment over time can easily be misinterpreted a change with time since treatment ; Repeated sampling of the chronosequence provides control for some of these effect . Ln the case of forest floor organic matter , however , high spatial variation make it difficult to distinguish whether the observed variation is more likely due to change in treatment over time or to difference in time since treatment . Because of the large amount of carbon involved , small change in rate of soil organic matter storage may be quite important in global climate change , but they will remain difficult to detect , even with very intensive sampling .

aVThe range of CO2 emission to the atmosphere from tropical land-use change ha long been debated . A major source of uncertainty is attributable to the flux of CO2 due to change in tropical land use . For example , estimate is different depending on whether the biomass or carbon content of tropical forest is totally lost by burning or recovered by regrowth . To estimate CO2 absorption by fallow forest after shifting cultivation , we investigated the floristic composition and measured the biomass of fallow forest in East Kalimantan , Indonesia . Above-ground biomass of fallow forest were 8-10 t/ha at one-year-old stand and 45-56 t/ha at 10-12-year-old stand , regardless of the floristic composition . It seems reasonable to suppose that 7.4 % of carbon released to the atmosphere by tropical rain forest destruction is reabsorbed and stored by fallow forest in Indonesia . If this is a universal trend in other tropical forest , a significant amount of CO2 is reabsorbed in fallow forest . We consider that fallow forest like the one studied here are substantial carbon sink and help to offset the effect of anthropogenic CO2 emission . ( C ) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

aVThe substitution of chlorofluorocarbon ( CFC ) ha represented a major challenge not only for the fluid producer but also for the final user who relied on these molecule . Rigid polyurethane foam have been profoundly affected by this change . This paper will especially address the consequence of the CFC-11 substitution on the formulation itself of rigid polyurethane foam . In a second part , the overall impact on the environment of current and future substitute will be reviewed : contribution to the global warming and to the creation of tropospheric ozone .

aVGlobal climate change is likely to have a range of consequence for human health a a result of disturbance or weakening of the biosphere 's natural or human-managed Life support system . The full range of potential human health impact of global climate change is diverse and would be distributed differentially spatially and over time . Changes in the mortality toll of heatwaves and change in the distribution of vector-borne infectious disease may occur early . The public health consequence of sea level rise and of regional change in agricultural productivity may not occur ( or become apparent ) for several decade . Vulnerability is a measure of both sensitivity to climate change and the ability to adapt in anticipation of , or in response to , it impact . The basic mode of adaptation to climate-induced health hazard are biological , behavioural and social . Adaptation can be undertaken at the individual , community and whole-population level . Adaptive strategy should not introduce new health hazard . Enhancement of the acknowledged public health infrastructure and intervention programme is essential to reduce vulnerability to the health impact of climate change . In the longer-term , fundamental improvement in the social and material condition of life and in the reduction of inequality within and between population are required for sustained reduction in vulnerability to environmental health hazard .

aVWetlands exist in a transition zone between aquatic and terrestrial environment which can be altered by subtle change in hydrology . Twentieth century climate record show that the United States is generally experiencing a trend towards a wetter , warmer climate ; some climate model suggest that this trend will continue and possibly intensify over the next 100 year . Wetlands that are most likely to be affected by these and other potential change ( e.g. , sea-level rise ) associated with atmospheric carbon enrichment include permafrost wetland , coastal and estuarine wetland , peatlands , alpine wetland , and prairie pothole wetland . Potential impact range from change in community structure to change in ecological function , and from extirpation to enhancement . Wetlands ( particularly boreal peatlands ) play an important role in the global carbon cycle , generally sequestering carbon in the form of biomass , methane , dissolved organic material and organic sediment . Wetlands that are drained or partially dried can become a net source of methane and carbon dioxide to the atmosphere , serving a a positive biotic feedback to global warming . Policy option for minimizing the adverse impact of climate change on wetland ecosystem include the reduction of current anthropogenic stress , allowing for inland migration of coastal wetland a sea-level rise , active management to preserve wetland hydrology , and a wide range of other management and restoration option .

aVAdequate knowledge of climatic change over the Tibetan Plateau ( TP ) with an average elevation of more than 4000 m above sea level ( a.s.1 . ) ha been insufficient for a long time owing to the lack of sufficient observational data . In the present study , monthly surface air temperature data were collected from almost every meteorological station on the TP since their establishment . There are 97 station located above 2000 m a.s.1 . on the TP ; the longest record at five station began before the 1930s , but most record date from the mid-1950s . Analyses of the temperature series show that the main portion of the TP ha experienced statistically significant warming since the mid-1950s , especially in winter , but the recent warming in the central and eastern TP did not reach the level of the 1940s warm period until the late 1990s . Compared with the Northern Hemisphere and the global average , the warming of the TP occurred early . The linear rate of temperature increase over the TP during the period 1955-1996 are about 0.16 degreesC/decade for the annual mean and 0.32 degreesC/decade for the winter mean , which exceed those for the Northern Hemisphere and the same latitudinal zone in the same period . Furthermore , there is also a tendency for the warming trend to increase with the elevation in the TP and it surrounding area . This suggests that the TP is one of the most sensitive area to respond to global climate change . Copyright ( C ) 2000 Royal Meteorological Society .

aVUtilization of nuclear energy is an effective way of solving the global warming resulting from CO2 emission . Thermal energy account for more than two third of total energy utilization at present and therefore it is significant to extend the utilization of nuclear heat for the effective reduction of CO2 emission in the world . This paper describes a coal gasification system using HTGR nuclear heat in an ammonia production plant in term of industrial utilization of the nuclear heat . The system us the nuclear heat directly in addition to generating electricity . A steam reforming method using a two-stage coal gasifier is employed : it improves the heat utilization efficiency of the secondary helium gas from the : HTGR . Finally , the paper clarifies that the nuclear gasification system can reduce CO2 emission by about five hundred thousand ton per year from that of a conventional system using fossil fuel .

aVTo accurately predict future CO2 level in the atmosphere , which is crucial in predicting global climate change , the source and sink of the atmosphere CO2 and their change over time must be determined . In this paper , some typical case are examined using published and unpublished data . Firstly , the sensitivity of carbonate rock weathering ( including the effect by both dissolution and reprecipitation of carbonate ) to the change of soil CO2 and runoff will be discussed , and then the net amount of CO2 removed from the atmosphere in the carbonate rock area of mainland China and the world will be determined by the hydrochem-discharge and carbonate-rock-tablet method , to obtain an estimate of the contribution of carbonate rock weathering to the atmospheric CO2 sink . These contribution are about 0.018 billion metric ton of carbon/a and 0.11 billion metric ton of carbon/a for China and the world , respectively . Further , by the DBL ( Diffusion Boundary Layer ) -model calculation , the potential CO2 sink by carbonate rock dissolution is estimated to be 0.41 billion metric ton of carbon/a for the world . Therefore , the potential CO2 source by carbonate reprecipitation is 0.3 billion metric ton of carbon/a .

aVAnalysis of the reproductive dynamic of Calliptamus italicus during the past 100 year confirmed the dependence of locust invasion on the 11-year cycle of solar activity , which wa previously known for other gregarious locust . Over a considerable part of the specie range , the onset of mass reproduction is promoted by a hot and droughty spring and summer . The scale of the outbreak is determined by local condition in the focus of reproduction . The current global warming is characterized by an unstable , drastically varying climate with a trend toward aridity in many region . If this trend persists for several decade , we may expect an increase in the period of C. talicus mass reproduction and in the persistency and extent of damage indicted by locust on vast Palearctic area .

aVNon-stationary time series such a global and hemispheric temperature , greenhouse gas concentration , solar irradiance , and anthropogenic sulfate aerosol , may contain stochastic trend ( the simplest stochastic trend is a random walk ) which , due to their unique pattern , can act a a signal of the influence of other variable on the series in question . Two or more series may share a common stochastic trend , which indicates that either one series cause the behavior of the other or that there is a common driving variable . Recent development in econometrics allow analyst to detect and classify such trend and analyze relationship among series that contain stochastic trend . We apply some univariate autoregression based test to evaluate the presence of stochastic trend in several time series for temperature and radiative forcing . The temperature and radiative forcing series are found to be of different order of integration which would cast doubt on the anthropogenic global warming hypothesis . However , these test can suffer from size distortion when applied to noisy series such a hemispheric temperature . We , therefore , use multivariate structural time series technique to decompose Northern and Southern Hemisphere temperature into stochastic trend and autoregressive noise process . These result show that there are two independent stochastic trend in the data . We investigate the possible origin of these trend using a regression method . Radiative forcing due to greenhouse gas and solar irradiance can largely explain the common trend . The second trend , which represents the non-scalar non-stationary difference between the hemisphere , reflects radiative forcing due to tropospheric sulfate aerosol . We find similar result when we use the same technique to analyze temperature data generated by the Hadley Centre GCM SUL experiment .

aVTwo global climate model ( HadCM2 and ECHAM ) forced with the same greenhouse-gas scenario ( IS92a ) are found to disagree in their simulated long-term trend of the intensity of the Arctic Oscillation ( AO ) , an atmospheric circulation pattern of the Northern Hemisphere . The simulated AO trend are strongly dependent on the model and on the initial condition of the simulation . The simulated winter temperature increase averaged over the Northern hemisphere is very similar in both model . However , the effect of the different AO trend on temperature cause clear difference in the predicted regional warming , which are reduced if the effect of the AO is linearly discounted . The uncertainty in the prediction of circulation change ha impact bn the estimation of regional temperature change .

aVGlobal climate change ha been one of the challenging environmental concern facing policy maker over the past decade . The characterization of the wide range of greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emission source and sink , a well a their behavior in the atmosphere , remains a continuing activity in many country , Solid waste is considered a source of greenhouse gas emission owing to microbial decomposition of organic material , which constitute the greater portion of solid waste . The extent of these emission is highly dependent on waste management practice . In many country , landfill remain an essential part of any waste management system and often the only economic form of municipal solid waste disposal . This paper describes solid waste management practice in Lebanon , estimate the corresponding current and future greenhouse gas emission from this sector , and proposes mitigation alternative to reduce these emission . An economic assessment of these alternative in the context of characteristic specific to the country is also presented in term of equivalent cost of emission reduction .

aVMost of the nitrous oxide ( N2O ) in the atmosphere , thought to be involved in global warming , is emitted from soil . Although the main factor controlling the production of N2O in soil are well known , we need more quantitative data on the interaction of soil and the environment in the soil that affect the emission . We therefore studied the effect of irrigation , cropping ( fallow , barley with grass undersown ) and N fertilization ( unfertilized , 103 kg N ha ( -1 ) ) on the composition of soil air and direct N2O emission from soil ( using the closed chamber method ) in a factorial field experiment on a well-structured loamy clay soil during 1 June-22 October 1993 . The measurement were made weekly during the growing season and three time after harvesting . The composition of the soil air did not indicate severe anoxia in any treatment or combination of treatment , but the accumulation of N2O in the soil air indicated that hypoxia wa common . At the start of the irrigation the emission were small , even though there wa much ammonium and nitrate in the soil and therefore a potential for emission of N2O produced by both nitrification and denitrification . Larger emission occurred later . The largest emission were found when 60-90 % of the soil pore space wa filled with water . Irrigation and fertilization with N both roughly doubled the cumulative N2O emission . Growing a crop decreased it by a factor of 3-7 . Most N2O wa lost from the irrigated fertilized soil under fallow ( 3.5 kg N ha ( -1 ) ) , and least from the unirrigated unfertilized soil under barley ( 0.1 kg N ha ( -1 ) ) .

aVAn increase in concentration of atmospheric CO2 is one major factor influencing global climate change . Among the consequence of such an increase is the stimulation of plant growth and productivity . Below-ground microbial process are also likely to be affected indirectly by rising atmospheric CO2 level , through increased root growth and rhizodeposition rate . Because change in microbial community composition might have an impact on symbiotic interaction with plant , the response of root nodule symbionts to elevated atmospheric CO2 wa investigated . In this study we determined the genetic structure of 120 Rhizobium leguminosarum by , trifolii isolates from white clover plant exposed to ambient ( 350 mu mol mol ( -1 ) ) or elevated ( 600 mu mol-mol ( -1 ) ) atmospheric CO2 concentration in the Swiss FACE ( Free-Air-Carbon-Dioxide-Enrichment ) facility . Polymerase Chain Reaction ( PCR ) fingerprinting of genomic DNA showed that the isolates from plant grown under elevated CO2 were genetically different from those isolates obtained from plant grown under ambient condition . Moreover , there wa a 17 % increase in nodule occupancy under condition of elevated atmospheric CO2 when strain of R. leguminosarum by . trifolii isolated from plot exposed to CO2 enrichment were evaluated for their ability to compete for nodulation with those strain isolated from ambient condition . These result indicate that a shift in the community composition of R. leguminosarum by . trifolii occurred a a result of an increased atmospheric CO2 concentration , and that elevated atmospheric CO2 affect the competitive ability of root nodule symbionts , most likely leading to a selection of these particular strain to nodulate white clover .

aVArid ecosystem , which occupy about 20 % of the earth 's terrestrial surface area , have been predicted to be one of the most responsive ecosystem type to elevated atmospheric CO2 and associated global climate change ( 1-3 ) . Here we show , using free-air CO2 enrichment ( FACE ) technology in an intact Mojave Desert ecosystem ( 4 ) , that new shoot production of a dominant perennial shrub is doubled by a 50 % increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration in a high rainfall year . However , elevated CO2 doe not enhance production in a drought year . We also found that aboveground production and seed rain of an invasive annual grass increase more at elevated CO2 than in several specie of native annual . Consequently , elevated CO2 might enhance the longterm success and dominance of exotic annual grass in the region . This shift in specie composition in favour of exotic annual grass , driven by global change , ha the potential to accelerate the fire cycle , reduce biodiversity and alter ecosystem function in the desert of western North America .

aVThe most common method used to evaluate climate model involves spinning them up under perpetual present-day forcing find comparing the model result with present-day observation . This approach clearly ignores any potential long-term memory of the model ocean to past climatic condition . Here we examine the validity of this approach through the 6000-year integration of a coupled atmosphere-ocen-sea-ice model . The coupled model is initially spun-up , with atmospheric CO2 concentration and orbital parameter applicable for 6KBP . The model is then integrated forward in time to 2100 . Results from this transient coupled model simulation are compared with the result from two additional simulation , in which the model is spun up with perpetual 1850 ( preindustrial ) and 1998 ( present-day ) atmospheric CO2 concentration and orbital parameter . This comparison lead to substantial difference between the equilibrium climatology and the transient simulation , even at 1850 tin weakly ventilated region ) , prior to any significant change in atmospheric CO2 . When compared to the present-day equilibrium climatology , difference fire very large : the global mean surface air and sea surface temperature are similar to0.5 degreesC and similar to0.4 degreesC colder respectively deep ocean temperature are substantially cooler Southern Hemisphere sea-ice cover is 38 % larger , and the North Atlantic conveyor 16 % weaker in the transient case . These difference are due to the long timescale memory of the deep ocean to climatic condition which prevailed throghout the late Holocene , a well a to it large thermal inertia . It is also demonstrated that a 'cold start ' global warming simulation tone that start from a 1998 equilibrium climatology ) underestimate the global temperature increase at 2100 by similar to 10 % . Our result question the accuracy of current technique for climate model evaluation find underline the importance of using using paleoclimatic simulation in parallel with present-day simulation in this evaluation process .

aVSince direct disposal of CO2 in the ocean is a highly potential sequestration option , the process of oceanic disposal of CO2 ha attracted much attention a an effective technology that can declerate global-warming . When CO2 is discharged in deep sea region subject to high pressure and low temperature , CO2 hydrate can be formed easily . For the design pur pose of the CO2 disposal process , the formation rate of the CO2 hydrate is required . Furthermore , it is well known that natural gas is often found at off-shore , buried under oceanic sediment . It should be necessary , therefore , to understand the interaction between the gas hydrate and the solid material in the deep sea bed . The purpose of this paper is to investigate experimentaly the effect of clay material in deep sea bed on rate of formation of CO2 hydrate . Since montmorillonites are the main component of the clay material , the author used two kind of montmorillonites , Na- and Ca-montmorillonite . The Na-montmorillonite is hydrophillic , while the Ca-montmorillonite is hydrophobic . The rate of formation of the hydrate wa determined from measurement of rate of consumption of CO2 . During the process of formation of hydrate , both temperature and pressure in the reactor deviate from the initially setted value . The author , therefore , studied the relation between the rate of formation of hydrate at an initial stage and the content of the montmorillonite . It wa found that the initial rate of formation of hydrate drop a the content of Na-montmorillonite increase . On the other hand , the effect of the Ca-montmorillonite wa not so significant .

aVCarbon emission which would cause global warming were agreed to be constrained at COP3 in Kyoto . In addition , carbon emission permit trading wa also approved to be introduced . The emission permit trading is expected to achieve efficient carbon emission reduction , equalizing the marginal cost of the emission reduction for the participating country . Zn other word , the permit trading allows participant to reduce emission where it is least expensive to do so . However , the inadequate introduction of the trading system may impose an unfairly greater burden on settle country , and therefore careful evaluation of the system would be indispensable for it implementation . In this paper we attempt to analyze emission permit trading , using the theory of cooperative game with a global energy model of optimization type . We assume that seven world region a player participate in the permit trading system under the condition of the emission reduction target presented at COP3 and so on , and show the nucleolus of the grand coalition game , and the computational result of primary energy supply and CO2 shadow price . The insight of this research indicate that in order to stabilize the grand coalition , a noticeable amount of additional transfer of : money would be needed besides the payment associated with the emission permit transaction .

aVCurrent ecosystem model prediction concerning the effect of global temperature increase on forest response do not account for factor influencing long-term evolutionary dynamic of natural population . Population structure and genetic variability may represent important factor in a specie ' ability to adapt to global-scale environmental change without experiencing major alteration in current range limit . Genetic variation and structure in sugar maple ( Acer saccharum Marsh . ) were examined across three region , between two stand within region , and among four to five open-pollinated family within stand ( total N = 547 genotype ) using 58 randomly amplified polymorphic DNA ( RAPD ) marker . Differences within open-pollinated family account for the largest portion of the total variation ( 29 % ) , while difference among region represent le than 2 % of the total variation . Genetic diversity , a indicated by estimate of percent polymorphic locus , expected heterozygosity , fixation coefficient , and genetic distance , is greatest in the southern region , which consists of population with the maximum potential risk due to climate change effect . The high level of genetic similarity ( greater than 90 % ) among some genotype suggests that gene flow is occurring among region , stand , and family . High level of genetic variation among family indicate that vegetational model designed to predict specie ' response to global-scale environmental change may need to consider the degree and hierarchical structure of genetic variation when making large-scale inference .

aVIncrease in the use of conservation practice by agriculture in the United States will enhance soil organic carbon and potentially increase carbon sequestration . This , in turn , will decrease the net emission of carbon dioxide . A number of study exist that calibrate the contribution of various individual , site-specific conservation practice on change in soil organic carbon . There is a general absence , however , of a comprehensive effort to measure objectively the contribution of these practice including conservation tillage , the Conservation Reserve Program , and conservation buffer strip to an change in soil organic carbon . This paper fill that void . After recounting the evolution of the use of the various conservation practice , it is estimated that organic carbon in the soil in 1998 in the United States attributable to these practice wa about 12.2 million metric ton . By 2008 , there will be an increase of about 25 % . Given that there is a significant potential for conservation practice , which could lead to an increase in carbon sequestration , there are a number of policy option that can be pursued . These include education and technical assistance , financial assistance , research and development , land retirement , and regulation and tax .

aVTropical forest conversion , shifting cultivation and clearing of secondary vegetation make significant contribution to global emission of greenhouse gas today , and have the potential for large additional emission in future decade . Globally , an estimated 3.1x10 ( 9 ) t of biomass carbon of these type is exposed to burning annually , of which 1.1x10 ( 9 ) t is emitted to the atmosphere through combustion and 49x10 ( 6 ) t is converted to charcoal ( including 26-31x10 ( 6 ) t C of black carbon ) . The amount of biomass exposed to burning includes aboveground remains that failed to burn or decompose from clearing in previous year , and therefore exceeds the 1.9x10 ( 9 ) t of aboveground biomass carbon cleared on average each year . Above- and belowground carbon emitted annually through decomposition process total 2.1x10 ( 9 ) t C. A total gross emission ( including decomposition of unburned aboveground biomass and of belowground biomass ) of 3.41x10 ( 9 ) t C year ( - ) 1 result from clearing primary ( nonfallow ) and secondary ( fallow ) vegetation in the tropic . Adjustment for trace gas emission using IPCC Second Assessment Report 100-year integration global warming potential make this equivalent to 3.39x10 ( 9 ) t of CO ( 2 ) -equivalent carbon under a low trace gas scenario and 3.83x10 ( 9 ) t under a high trace gas scenario . Of these total , 1.06x10 ( 9 ) t ( 31 % ) is the result of biomass burning under the low trace gas scenario and 1.50x10 ( 9 ) t ( 39 % ) under the high trace gas scenario . The net emission from all clearing of natural vegetation and of secondary forest ( including both biomass and soil flux ) is 2.0x10 ( 9 ) t C , equivalent to 2.0-2.4x10 ( 9 ) t of CO ( 2 ) -equivalent carbon . Adding emission of 0.4x10 ( 9 ) t C from land-use category change other than deforestation brings the total for land-use change ( not considering uptake of intact forest , recurrent burning of savanna or fire in intact forest ) to 2.4x10 ( 9 ) t C , equivalent to 2.4-2.9x10 ( 9 ) t of CO ( 2 ) -equivalent carbon . The total net emission of carbon from the tropical land us considered here ( 2.4x10 ( 9 ) t C year ( - ) 1 ) calculated for the 1981-1990 period is 50 % higher than the 1.6x10 ( 9 ) t C year ( - ) 1 value used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change . The inferred ( = `missing ' ) sink in the global carbon budget is larger than previously thought . However , about half of the additional source suggested here may be offset by a possible sink in uptake by Amazonian forest . Both alteration indicate that continued deforestation would produce greater impact on global carbon emission . The total net emission of carbon calculated here indicates a major global warming impact from tropical land us , equivalent to approximately 29 % of the total anthropogenic emission from fossil fuel and land-use change .

aVAgriculture play a major role in the global flux of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide , nitrous oxide , and methane . From 1991 to 1999 , we measured gas flux and other source of global warming potential ( GWP ) in cropped and nearby unmanaged ecosystem . Net GWP ( gram of carbon dioxide equivalent per square meter per year ) ranged from 110 in our conventional tillage system to -211 in early successional community . None of the annual cropping system provided net mitigation , although soil carbon accumulation in no-till system came closest to mitigating all other source of GWP . In all but one ecosystem , nitrous oxide production wa the single greatest source of GWP . In the Late successional system , GWP wa neutral because of significant methane oxidation . These result suggest additional opportunity for Lessening the GWP of agronomic system .

aVThe batch culture of a newly isolated strain of a green microalga , Chlorella sorokiniana , wa carried out using a conical helical tubular photobioreactor . The isolate wa capable of good growth at 40 degree C under an airstream enriched with 10 % CO2 . The maximum photosynthetic productivity wa 34.4 g of dry biomass/ ( m ( 2 ) of installation area . d ) ( 12-h light/12-h dark cycle ) when the cell were illuminated with an average photosynthetic photon flux density ( photosynthetically active radiation ( [ PAR ] 400-700 nm ) simulating the outdoors in central Japan ( 0.980 mmol photons/ [ m ( 2 ) .s ] ) . This corresponded to a photosynthetic efficiency of 8.67 % ( PAR ) , which wa defined a the percent age of the light energy recovered a biomass ( 394 kJ/ [ reactor.d ] ) to the total light energy received ( 4545 kJ/ [ reactor.d ] ) . A similarly high photosynthetic efficiency ( 8.12 % [ PAR ] ) wa also attained in the combined presence of 10 % CO2 , 100 ppm of NO , and 25 ppm of SO2 . Moreover , good photosynthetic productivity wa also obtained under high temperature and high light intensity condition ( maximum temperature , 46.5 degree C ; 1.737 mmol photons/ [ m ( 2 ) .s ] ) , when simulating the strong irradiance of the midday summer sun . This strain thus appears well suited for practical application for converting CO2 present in the stack gas emitted by thermal power plant and should be feasible even during the hot summer weather .

The potential impact of climate change are examined for Jordan , where a methodology is presented for improved management of water demand under the uncertainty associated with climate change . A temperature/precipitation sensitivity model is constructed and combined with water demand forecast to project deficit for the year 2020 . Deficit reducing option are then evaluated in term of social and economic viability . The study concludes that only some of the deficit may be alleviated , illustrating the significance of considering climate change in planning for country that already experience water imbalance .

aVSoil respiration is indicative of biological status of the soil and high respiration is correlated to high content of available carbon ( C ) in soil and/or organic matter content . Because of soil respiration 's relationship to soil organic matter status and content , soil respiration is considered one measurement that could aid in determining the quality of soil . In the global scale , the cycling of C in soil is important because the rise in CO2 in the atmosphere is linked to global climate change . In situ measurement of CO2 using instrument that are portable and perform analysis quickly are important to obtain sufficient number of measurement in the field to overcome spatial variability . Soil respiration test were conducted in plot amended with fertilizer or organic amendment of agricultural or municipal residue since 1994 . Besides CO2 moisture and temperature were measured over a period where the moisture varied from near saturation to below wilting point . It wa found that flux wa curvilinearly related to moisture from 5 to 40 % ( v/v ) . Maximum flux occurred for all plot between 30 and 40 % saturation . The ratio of flux normalized by temperature to the volumetric soil moisture divided soil into two category , those with soil organic matter ( SOM ) content above or below 4.5 % . The determination of CO2 flux , moisture and temperature us equipment that is portable so that several site in a field can be analyzed to reduce spatial variation . The only limitation is that the determination must be performed on soil with le than 40 % saturation or 25 % moisture ( v/v ) because the normalized function is no longer linear above this moisture content . More than two SOM category might be found if study are expanded to soil with a wider range of SOM content .

aVThe short-term ( 24h ) and : medium-term ( 30 day ) influence of N salt ( NH4Cl , NaNO3 and NaNO2 ) and a non-N salt ( NaCl ) on first-order rate constant , k ( h ( -1 ) ) and threshold ( C-Th ) for atmospheric CH4 oxidation by homogenized composite of upland boreal forest and tundra soil wa assessed at salt addition ranging to 20 mu mol g ( -1 ) dry weight ( dw ) soil . Additions of NH4Cl , NaNO3 and NaCl to 0.5 mu mol g ( -1 ) dw soil did not significantly decrease k relative to watered control in the short term . Higher concentration significantly reduced k , with the degree of inhibition increasing with increasing dose . Similar dos of NH4Cl and NaCl gave comparable decrease in k relative to control and both soil showed low native concentration of NH4+-N ( le than or equal to 1 mu mol g ( -1 ) dw soil ) , suggesting that the reduction in k wa due primarily to a salt influence rather than competitive inhibition of CH4 oxidation by exogenous NH4+-N or NH4+-N released through cation exchange . The decrease in k wa consistently le for NaNO3 than for NH4Cl and NaCl at similar dos , pointing to a strong inhibitory effect of the Cl- counteranion . Thresholds for CH4 oxidation were le sensitive to salt addition than k for these three salt , a significant increase in C-Th relative to control were only observed at concentration greater than or equal to 1.0 mu mol g ( -1 ) dw soil . Both soil were more sensitive to NaNO2 than to other salt in the short term , showing a significant decrease in k at an addition of 0.25 mu mol NaNO2 g ( -1 ) dw soil that wa clearly attributable to NO ; . Soils showed no recovery from NaCl , NH4+-N or NaNO3 addition with respect to atmospheric CH4 oxidation after 30days . However , soil amended with NaNO2 to 1.0 mu mol NaNO2 g ( -1 ) dw showed value of k that were not significantly different from control . Recovery of CH4-oxidizing ability wa due to complete oxidation of NO2 -- N to NO3 -- N. Analysis of soil concentration of N salt necessary to inhibit atmospheric CH4 oxidation and regional rate of N deposition suggest that N deposition will not decrease the future sink strength of upland high-latitude soil in the atmospheric CH4 budget .

aVChanges in climatic condition may influence both forest biomass accumulation rate and natural disturbance regime . While change in biomass accumulation of forest under various climatic condition have been described by yield equation , large uncertainty exist with regard to disturbance regime . Under the doubling carbon dioxide scenario , global warming impact have been predicted from simulation result of the first generation of coupled global climate model ( CGCMI ) . The calculated fine fuel moisture code ( FFMC ) distribution from the simulation result showed a one-point increase compared with the distribution under current climate condition . The impact of predicted change in FFMC distribution on fire disturbance pattern , forest volume , and landscape structure wa investigated by using the spatially explicit model for landscape dynamic ( SEM-LAND ) . The simulation result showed increase in fire disturbance frequency and decrease in forest volume . The simulation also showed decrease in landscape fragmentation and landscape diversity , whereas total availability of core habitat for wildlife increased .

aVElevated atmospheric CO2 concentration will cause plant to grow faster , lower nitrogen content per unit of plant tissue , and generate higher carbon to nitrogen ( C/N ) ratio . We hypothesize that production of transgenic protein will be reduced , thus reducing the efficiency of Bacillus thuringiensis ( Bt ) transgene against insect population . Commercially available transgenic cotton plant expressing the Cry 1Ac gene from Bt were compared with a near isogenic non-Bt cotton line in a split-plot design with two level of atmospheric CO2 ( ambient , 370 ppm and elevated , 900 ppm ) incorporating a 2 X 2 factorial design with two nitrogen ( N ) fertilization regime ( low , 30 mg N/kg soil/wk and high , 130 mg N/kg soil/wk ) , and two level of Bt ( presence or absence ) . Bioassays using Spodoptera exigua ( Hubner ) and quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for toxin content indicated reduced Bt protein production in elevated CO2 . The tendency for test insect to consume more foliage from plant with lower N , caused by the elevated CO2 , did not compensate for the reduction in toxin production . N fertilization regime interacted with CO2 concentration , showing that plant growing in N limited system would produce-substantially le toxin . The use of transgenic plant is becoming increasingly important and will continue to be so in the next decade . At the same time , atmospheric CO2 increase will affect the effectiveness of this strategy . These observation have implication not only for agricultural use of transgenic plant , but also for the ecological consequence of transfer of Bt toxin to closely related wild plant genotype .

aVA simple energy balance model with two parameter , an effective heat capacity and an effective climate sensitivity , is used to interpret six CCM simulation of greenhouse gas-induced global warming . By allowing the parameter to vary in time , the model can be accurately calibrated for each run . It is found that the sensitivity can be approximated a a constant in each case . However the effective heat capacity clearly varies , and it is important that the energy equation is formulated appropriately , and thus unlike many such model . For simulation with linear forcing and from a cold start , the capacity is in each case close to that of a homogeneous ocean with depth initially 200 m , but increasing some 4.3 m each year irrespective of the sensitivity and forcing growth rate . Analytic solution for this linear capacity function are derived , and these reproduce the GCM run well , even for case where the forcing is stabilized after a century or so . The formation of a subsurface maximum in the mean ocean temperature anomaly is a significant feature of such case . A simple model for a GCM run with a realistic forcing scenario starting from 1880 is constructed using component result for forcing segment . Given this . an estimate of the cold start error of a simulation of the warming due to forcing after the present would be given by the negative of the temperature drift of the anomaly due to the past forcing . The simple model can evidently be used to give an indication of likely warming curve , at least for this range of scenario and GCM sensitivity .

aVAn unprecedented mass mortality event ha been observed at the end of the summer 1999 along the coast of Provence ( France ) and Ligury ( Italy ) . This event ha severely affected a wide array of sessile filter-feeder invertebrate from hard-substratum community , such a sponge ( particularly the keratose sponge Hipposongia and Spongia ) , cnidarian ( particularly the anthozoan Corallium , Paramuricea , Eunicella and Cladocora ) , bivalve , ascidian and bryozoan . Along the Provence coast , the outbreak spread from east to west . Exceptionally high and constant temperature of the whole water column ( 23-24 degreesC , for over one month , down to 40 m ) could have determined an environmental context favourable to the mass mortality event . Like the thermal anomaly , the mortality is limited in depth . However , rye can not ascertain whether temperature had a direct effect on organism or acted in synergy with a latent and/or waterborne agent ( microbiological or chemical ) . Taking into account the global warming context in the NW-Mediterranean , monitoring program of physical-chemical parameter and vulnerable population should rapidly be set up .

aVA major portion ( 60-90 % ) of the methane ( CH4 ) emitted from rice field to the atmosphere is transported through the aerenchyma of the rice plant . However , a rapid and accurate method to study the CH4 transport capacity ( MTC ) of rice plant is not available . We developed a gas sampling and analytical device based on a closed two-compartment chamber technique and analyzed the enrichment of the CH4 mixing ratio inside the shoot compartment of cylindrical cuvettes enclosing individual rice plant under ambient condition . The computer-controlled analytical system consists of a gas chromatograph ( GC ) and a pressure-controlled autosampler for eight cuvettes ( seven for plant and one for CH4-calibration gas ) . The system automates closure and opening of plant cuvettes using pneumatic pressure , air sample collection and injection into the GC , and CH4 analysis . It minimizes source of error during air sampling by continuously mixing headspace air of each cuvette , maintaining pressure and composition of the headspace inside the cuvettes , purging the dead volume between the sampler induction tube and GC , and running a reference CH4-calibration gas sample in each cycle . Tests showed that the automated system is a useful tool for accurate sampling of headspace air of cylindrical cuvettes enclosing individual rice plant and enables rapid and accurate fully automated analysis of CH4 in the headspace air sample . A linear relationship wa obtained between CH4 transported by rice plant of two cultivar ( IR72 , a high-yielding dwarf , and Dular , a traditional tall cultivar ) and concentration of CH4 up to 7,500 ppm used for purging the nutrient culture solution surrounding the root in the root compartment of the chamber . Further increase in CH4 emission by shoot wa not observed at 10,000 ppm CH4 concentration in the root compartment of the chamber . The MTC of IR72 wa measured at six development stage ; it wa lowest at seedling stage , increasing gradually until panicle initiation . There wa no further change at flowering , but a marked decrease at maturity wa noted . These result suggest that the plant have 45-246 % greater potential to transport CH4 than the highest CH4 emission rate reported under field condition , and plant would not emit CH4 at early growth and at a reduced rate close to ripening .

aVThe importance of migratory caribou ( Rangifer tarandus ) to northerner , the increasing pressure to extract non-living resource , and predicted global climate change have led researcher , manager and resource user alike to focus on how to improve our knowledge of this unique northern ungulate . Unprecedented threat to caribou sustainability , along with the increasingly acknowledged value of indigenous hunter ' contribution to caribou research , pose the additional challenge to innovate research method that accommodate differing cultural perspective and facilitate communication among group . This paper survey the state of scientific knowledge of the eleven major northern mainland herd of North America . We recommend an approach to improve our working knowledge of barren-ground caribou in order to ass better future impact . The transfer of knowledge gained from year of research and indigenous experience on many aspect of caribou ecology should be evaluated and , where applicable , transferred to herd with more modest database . The establishment of a North American Caribou Monitoring and Assessment System , based on a synthesis of local knowledge and research-based science , is recommended a a tool for improved communication and collective learning .

aVAt present , most turtle , all crocodilian , and several lizard are known to have temperature-dependent sex determination ( TSD ) . Due to the dependence of sex determination on incubation temperature , the long-term survival of TSD specie may be jeopardized by global climate change . The current study wa designed to ass the degree to which this concern is justified by examining nest-site selection in two specie of Pattern II TSD gecko ( Eublepharis macularius and Hemitheconyx caudicinctus ) and comparing these preference with those of a specie with genotypic sex determination ( GSD ) ( Coleonyx mitratus ) . Temperature preference for nest site were found to be both species-specific and female-specific . While H. caudicinctus female selected a mean nest-site temperature ( 32.4 degree ) very close to the upper pivotal temperature ( 32 degree C ) for the specie , E. macularius female selected a mean nest-site temperature ( 28.7 degree C ) well below this specie ' lower pivotal temperature ( 30.5 degree C ) . Thus , the resultant sex ratio are expected to differ between these two TSD specie . Additionally , nest-site temperature for the GSD specie were significantly more variable ( SE = +/-0.37 ) than were temperature for either of the TSD specie ( E. macularius SE = +/- 0.10 ; H. caudicinctus SE = +/-0.17 ) , thereby further demonstrating temperature preference within the TSD specie .

aVThe nitrogen pool in Russian peatlands reach 4.69 x 10 ( 9 ) t. Half of this amount is stored in humic substance ( mainly , in humic acid ) of peat . The nitrogen of relatively stable compound ( mainly , the humin nitrogen ) constitutes about 1.8 x 10 ( 9 ) t. Easily hydrolyzable and mineral nitrogen compound constitute 9.7 and 1.8 % of the total nitrogen pool , respectively . Most of the nitrogen in eutrophic bog is bound with humic substance , while that of oligotrophic peat is represented by poorly hydrolyzable and nonhydrolyzable form . The pool of water-soluble nitrogen constitutes 20.3 x 10 ( 6 ) t , or 0.43 % of the total nitrogen reserve . In the case of global warming , eutrophic and mesotrophic bog can become an important source of ammonia emission to the atmosphere .

Afforestation of arid land is hindered by water shortage , and requires more effective utilization of limited rainwater . The concept of this study is to evaluate the various countermeasure for constructing water balance system , from different viewpoint of conventional element-technology-oriented measure . In this study , Leonora in Western Australia wa selected a a research area , and the infiltration process in the area wa analyzed by two kind of simulation model . Their validity wa tested by comparing with the experimental result using glass bead with simple characteristic . It wa clearly demonstrated that each model ha it own problem . Then we evaluated the infiltration rate of precipitated water into Australian specific soil by the model which showed better approximation result to the experiment with glass bead . As a result , it is suggested that the poor permeability of the soil limit plant growth in the Australian specific area .

aVDuring the last two winter widespread fog frequently occurred in northeastern India and Pakistan , in a region extending over 1500 km . A particularly severe fog episode lasted from midDecember , 1998 to early January , 1999 . The fog caused extensive economic damage and disruption in transport . We determined concentration of SO42- , NO3- , and selected trace element at Lahore , Pakistan during and after the fog event by collecting aerosol on Whatman 41 filter every 12 h. SO42- concentration of up to 100 mu g/m ( 3 ) were observed during fog . The SO42-/Se ratio and trace element data suggest a distant source of SO42- aerosol , hundred of km away . Lahore wa downwind of coal-burning in India during the fog . The high concentration of SO42- observed suggest a more extensive investigation of the chemistry and transport process in this region is necessary to delineate emission source and develop control strategy a there are serious likely effect on human health and economy in a region populated by hundred of million of people , and on global climate change through direct ; md indirect forcing .

aVThe Kyoto Protocol , agreed to by more than 160 nation in 1997 , represents an enormous challenge to national government , with vigorous disagreement among the party regarding the best way to achieve greenhouse gas emission reduction . Some mechanism for emission reduction are of concern to the petroleum industry , including joint implementation , the Clean Development Mechanisms , emission trading , and carbon sink generated through land use change and forest management . The negotiating objective of the EU illustrate how proposal and restriction might impact company in the industry . Most observer agree that the Kyoto Protocol is not likely to come into effect in it current form , and that only a few country can hope to achieve their reduction target because of major economic concern . Regardless of the protocol 's fate , the challenge remains for the industry to exercise it right and obligation to become part of the solution to climate change .

aVPerfluorinated compound ( PFCs ) , gas which have large global warming potential , are widely used in plasma processing for etching and chamber cleaning . Due to underutilization of the feedstock gas or by-product generation , the effluent from plasma tool using these gas typically have large mole fraction of PFCs . The use of plasma burn-boxes located downstream of the plasma chamber ha been proposed a a method for abating PFC emission with the goal of reducing the cost of PFC abatement and avoiding the NOx formation usually found with thermal treatment method . Results from the two-dimensional Hybrid Plasma Equipment Model have been used to investigate the scaling of plasma abatement of PFCs using plasma burn-boxes . An inductively coupled plasma ( ICP ) etching chamber is modeled to determine the utilization of the feedstock gas and the generation of by-product . The effluent from the etching chamber is then passed through a plasma burn-box excited by a second ICP source . O-2 , H-2 , and H2O are examined a additive gas in the burn-box . We find that C2F6 ( or CF4 ) consumption in the etching reactor increase with increasing ICP power deposition at constant C2F6 ( or CF4 ) mole fraction , and decreasing C2F6 ( or CF4 ) mole fraction or total gas flow rate at constant power . The efficiency of removal of C2F6 ( eV/molecule ) , however , is strongly dependent only on the C2F6 mole fraction and total gas flow rate . All PFCs in the effluent can generally be abated in the burn-box at high power deposition with a sufficiently large flow of additive gas . In general CF4 generation occurs during abatement of C2F6 using O-2 a an additive . CF4 is not , however , substantially produced when using H-2 or H2O a additive . The efficiency of PFC abatement decrease with increasing power and decreasing additive mole fraction . ( C ) 2000 American Vacuum Society . [ S0734-2101 ( 00 ) 02401-5 ] .

aVClimate modeler have recognized the possibility of abrupt climate change caused by a reorganization of the North Atlantic 's current pattern ( technically known a a thermohaline circulation collapse ) . This circulation system now warms north-western Europe and transport carbon dioxide to the deep ocean . The posited collapse of this system could produce severe cooling in northwestern Europe , even when general global warming is in progress . In this paper we use a simple integrated assessment model to investigate the optimal policy response to this risk . Adding the constraint of avoiding a thermohaline circulation collapse would significantly reduce the allowable greenhouse gas emission in the long run along an optimal path . Our analysis implies that relatively small damage associated with a collapse ( le than 1 % of gross world product ) would justify a considerable reduction of future carbon dioxide emission .

aVThere is a long-standing tradition of dividing Quaternary stratigraphical sequence on the basis of climate . This climatostratigraphical approach , begun on terrestrial sequence in the last century , led to the widespread adoption of glacial , interglacial , stadial and interstadial subdivision a standard . However , the limitation of the approach resulted in it replacement by local sequence of chronostratigraphical stage from the 1950s . The subsequent establishment of the detail and complexity of ocean-core sequence ha encouraged increasing use of the terminology developed for these record to the terrestrial and shallow marine succession . The view is expressed that it is advisable to separate and retain regional chronostratigraphies for each sequence-type , and that these should be correlated using event-based stratigraphy where possible . This should ensure both the highest precision and lack of ambiguity and a securely-based synthesis of the relation between the terrestrial and ocean isotope sequence , a synthesis which is fundamental to understanding the nature and detail of regional and global climate change .

aVA new method for reducing iron-ore without greenhouse effect gas exhaust wa developed to prevent the global warming . The reduction of alpha-Fe2O3 ( hematite ) by ball-milling with hydrogen gas flow wa studied by XRD , SEM , TEM and Mossbauer spectroscopy . Iron oxide ( alpha-Fe2O3 ) powder wa charged into a container for ball-milling with stainless steel ball . The container wa designed to flow gas during ball-milling process . It ha two hole , one of which is for inducing hydrogen gas into container , other one is for exhausting a producing gas out of the container . Milling wa interrupted to take sample for estimating the deoxidization process . Charging and removal of the sample were done in a high purity argon atmosphere . A vibrating ball-mill machine wa used . The result of X-ray diffraction measurement show that the reduction of iron-oxide start at 18.0 k of ball-milling . The intensity of Bragg peak corresponding to the Fe2O3 decreased with milling time . Conversely to this , the intensity of Bragg peak of alpha-Fe increased . At 216.0 k of milling , almost the Bragg peak of Fe2O3 disappeared and the only Bragg peak of alpha-Fe remained . During this reducing process , Fe3O4 and FeO appeared a intermediate state between alpha-Fe2O3 and alpha-Fe . Nano-crystalline Fe wa obtained by the reduction of iron-oxide by ball-milling with hydrogen gas flow .

aVGlobal climate change doe not necessarily imply that temperature or precipitation is increasing at specific location . The hypothesis of increasing temperature and precipitation trend associated with global climate change is tested using actual annual temperature and precipitation data for nine selected weather station , spatially distributed across Canada . Vogelsang 's ( 1998 ) partial sum and Woodward et al 's ( 1997 ) bootstrap method are used for testing for trend Both method suggest no warming in the Canadian temperature series except for Toronto , Ontario , which had significant increase over time , along with Moncton , New Brunswick and Indian Head , Saskatchewan , which had marginal increase . There is no evidence of increasing trend in precipitation except for Moncton , New Brunswick , which had a significantly increasing trend , thus , public policy designed to address the regional effect of climate change need to be adapted for a particular ecological zone , based on knowledge of the climate trend for that region , rather than on general global climate change pattern .

aVPrevious study have shown that the oxygen isotope ratio ( delta ( 18 ) O ) of plant cellulose can serve a a sensitive proxy indicator of past climate , but it application ha mainly been restricted to tree-rings . Here we present a 6000-year high-resolution delta ( 18 ) O record of peat plant cellulose from northeastern China . The delta ( 18 ) O Variation is interpreted a reflecting change in regional surface air temperature . The climate event inferred from the isotope data agree well with archaeological and historic evidence . The record show a striking correspondence of climate event to nearly all of the apparent solar activity change characterized by the atmospheric radiocarbon in tree-rings over the past 6000 year . Spectral analysis of the delta ( 18 ) O record reveals the periodicity of around 86 , 93 , 101 , 110 , 127 , 132 , 140 , 155 , 207 , 245 , 311 , 590 , 820 and 1046 year , which are similar to those detected in the solar excursion . We consider these observation a further evidence for a close relationship between solar activity and climate variation on timescales of decade to century . Our result also have implication for distinguishing between natural and anthropogenic contribution to future climate change .

aVTrends of extreme wet and dry condition during recent decades-were examined using observed data for eastern China . Mean precipitation for the region ha shown a significant downward trend from the 1950s to the mid-1970s , and a positive trend since the late 1970s . The change in trend since the late 1970s , i.e . the period during which enhanced global warming emerged , is most prominent . The linear trend of the mean summer rainfall anomaly over the 4 subregions studied wa +7.5 % decade ( -1 ) . Changes in the trend of severe wet and dry event are not symmetrical . During the period 1977-1998 , the number of severe wet station increased at the rate of 20.3 decade ( -1 ) , but the trend far severe dry event wa only -5.4 decade ( -1 ) . Similar rainfall change can be found over many global land area . The summer rainfall in eastern China showed only a negligible secular trend during the period 1880-1998 . However , the decadal variation were clear . The mean rainfall in 1990-1998 wa higher than for any other decade in the last 100 yr . The linear trend of the 33-station mean during 1977-1998 wa +47.5 mm decade ( -1 ) ; such a strong increase is unprecedented in the record since 1880 . Decadal variation and global warming may both play important role in the recent significant increase in summer rainfall . This paper also present the result of greenhouse and/or aerosol forcing experiment , in which summer precipitation over eastern China is generally estimated to rise . There are many uncertainty , however , in the regional precipitation simulation . For example , the modeled rainfall is sensitive to whether aerosol are included or not . Further research is needed to determine whether there is a substantial relationship between the rainfall change in China and global greenhouse warming .

aVGlobal climate-change model ( GCMs ) predict that the midwest USA will be drier and warmer a a result of global climate change . Other study suggest that climate change ha already started in the Lake Michigan region . This study us climate prediction from GCMs and projection of historical climate-change trend to examine the potential effect of climate change on riparian vegetation along the Pere Marquette River in west central Michigan . A model of stream discharge a a function of temperature and precipitation wa used to estimate the percent of time that each of 25 plot would be inundated at a field site in the riparian corridor on the river . Four vegetation class were identified at the field site ( Alnus , Open-Viburnum , Fraxinus-Carpinus , and Acer-Tsuga ) . The stream discharge model wa used to calculate the percent of time each plot wa inundated at the field site under the different climate scenario and to predict the distribution of vegetation class that would be present under climate-change condition . The result suggest that the areal extent of vegetation class at the field site may change by up to 27 % .

aVThe observed global warming of the past century occurred primarily in two distinct 20-year period , from 1925 to 1944 and from 1978 to the present . Although the Latter warming is often attributed to a human-induced increase of greenhouse gas , cause of the earlier warming are le clear because this period precedes the time of strongest increase in human-induced greenhouse gas ( radiative ) forcing . Results from a set of six integration of a coupled ocean-atmosphere climate model suggest that the warming of the early 20th century could have resulted from a combination of human-induced radiative forcing and an unusually Large realization of internal multidecadal variability of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system . This conclusion is dependent on the model 's climate sensitivity , internal variability , and the specification of the time-varying human-induced radiative forcing .

aVAn article published by Friis-Christensen and Lassen [ 1991 ] appeared to indicate an association between solar cycle length ( SCLs ) and climate . It attracted worldwide attention and ha since been extensively referred to . We here present an updated analysis using a recent temperature reconstruction with the time period of comparison considerably expanded . The correlation is found to be weak . In the light of this new result we analyze the question how the article by Friis-Christensen and Lassen wa able to create the impression of a 'strikingly good agreement ' , a the author described it . We show that the main reason is an unacceptable mixing of filtered and nonfiltered data in the graphical representation . Hereby , an artificial agreement of the solar data with the global warming since 1970 wa established . The article by Friis-Christensen and Lassen ha created and still creates confusion both in scientific and public discussion on climate change . We have therefore found it relevant to deliver the present analysis .

aVInstrumental and paleodata from the last century are investigated to get circumstantial evidence for external influence on the Earth 's climate machine . Such influence could be of extraterrestrial and/or anthropogenic origin . Anthropogenic influence are separated from solar on superdecadal time scale and on a hemispheric level using a non-linear regression model . The function to be explained is the northern hemispheric temperature . The model contains two forcing component explicitly : A parameterized anthropogenic component , which describes the aggregated effect of greenhouse gas , aerosol and other anthropogenic climate impact . A solar component , which describes the solar variability history . The solution of the regression model allows , under certain assumption , a functional separation of the variability component and provides an estimation of their relative contribution to global warming during the last 140 year .

aVIn the 21st century increasing societal , environmental , and economic pressure will create a changing context for solving agricultural pest management problem . Interdisciplinary approach to problem solving will be needed to meet goal such a mitigating environmental degradation associated with the use of farm chemical , and increasing productivity by reducing insect and disease damage to crop , and reducing competition from weed . Crop system model will provide useful framework in which to examine the interrelationship among plant , the pest complex , and the environment to determine the most appropriate management strategy to meet individual and societal goal . Improved technique for managing pest , such a transgenic plant resistant to pest and disease , new biological control agent , innovative cultural control , biological pesticide , and additional information to improve efficacy of traditional chemical , will require weather data and forecast in order to be used , and climate information to determine their suitability for use . Climatic change , including global warming and increased variability , will require improved analysis that can be used to ass risk associated with existing and newly developed pest management strategy and technique , and to gauge the impact of these technique on productivity and profitability . Control recommendation will need to be evaluated for suitability in the farming system where they are to be implemented . Training in the basic of agrometeorological relationship and pest management discipline will have to be supplied to agricultural meteorologist , extension personnel involved in this work , and farmer . Research to successfully develop the new technology and the weather and climatic information required by the technology must be approached by interdisciplinary team that include agricultural meteorologist .

aVMethane is involved in a number of chemical and physical process in the Earths atmosphere , including global warming ( 1 ) , Atmospheric methane originates mainly from biogenic source , such a rice paddy and natural wetland ; the former account for at least 30 % of the global annual emission of methane to the atmosphere ( 2 ) . As an increase of rice production by 60 % is the most appropriate way to sustain the estimated increase of the human population during the next three decade ( 3 ) , intensified global fertilizer application will be necessary ( 3 ) : but it is known that an increase of the commonly used ammonium-based fertilizer can enhance methane emission from rice agriculture . Approximately 10-30 % of the methane produced by methanogen in rice paddy is consumed by methane-oxidizing bacteria associated with the root of rice ( 4,5 ) ; these bacteria are generally thought to be inhibited by ammonium-based fertilizer , a tvas demonstrated for soil ( 6-8 ) and sediment ( 9,10 ) . In contrast , we show here that the activity and growth of such bacteria in the root zone of rice plant are stimulated after fertilization . Using a combination of radioactive fingerprinting ( 11 ) and molecular biology ( 12 ) technique , we identify the bacteria responsible for this effect . We expect that our result will make necessary a re-evaluation of the link between fertilizer use and methane emission , with effect on global warming study .

aVThe strength of the CO2 hydrate membrane that form at the interface between liquid CO2 and artificial sea water at 40-45 MPa wa measured with Du-Nouy type surface tension meter . At low temperature with a subcooling greater than 5 K , the membrane strength , initially abut 0.1 N/m , decreased with increasing temperature , However , it increased sharply and reached a peak of about 0.9 N/m just below the dissociation temperature and abruptly drop to zero at the dissociation temperature . This abnormal tendency of the membrane strength wa previously observed by the author in an experiment with fresh water . The temperature of the abnormality , however , shift to lower temperature and the peak decrease with increasing salinity , This new phenomenon could exert major influence on the various CO2 ocean sequestration method that have been proposed to mitigate global warming . It can be explained in term of a model in which the dissociation process of hydrate that occurs near the dissociation temperature enhances the diffusion of water molecule in the hydrate membrane and make the membrane thicker .

aVThe impact of enhanced carbon dioxide concentration on deep tropical convection ( DTC ) is explored using the National Center for Atmospheric Research ( NCAR ) Climate System Model ( CSM 1 ) model . A 134-year simulation in which CO concentration increase 1 % year ( -l ) is analyzed . With approximately present-day CO2 concentration ( 367 ppmv ) the CSM1 simulation capture the observed relationship between outgoing longwave radiation ( OLR ) and sea-surface temperature ( SST ) in the tropic . The temperature threshold for deep convection in the model is approximately 24.75 degree C. As CO2 concentration increase , the simulated threshold temperature for tropical convection progressively increase to similar to 25.55 degree C and 26.55 degree C at 2xCO ( 2 ) ( year 80 ) and 3.4xC0 ( 2 ) ( year 133 ) . The fully coupled climate model response to increased CO2 concentration implies that the expansion of the 26 degree C isotherm , the present-day observed threshold , wilt not yield an expansion of the region of DTC .

aVLife cycle assessment ( LCA ) on total sewage sludge treatment system including thickening . anaerobic digestion , dewatering , and incineration/melting wa performed to estimate a global warming impact a carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) emission . As representative process for the assessment , the most typical and widely used process were selected . Generally . the life cycle of actual treatment facility consists of three stage : construction . operation and dismantlement . In this study , the amount of CO2 produced from the life cycle step of existing unit sludge treatment process , wa calculated by inventory analysis of input material . In addition , for all process investigated , individual CO2 emission unit ( CEUs ) , i.e . the amount of emitted CO2 for treating a unit weight of sludge , were also calculated . By using the obtained CEU matrix , it wa possible to simulate the CO2 production from various type of complex treatment system a well a to trace the dominant cause of CO2 production in individual treatment process .

aVDuring the time between May of 1997 and September of 1998 , for sixteen consecutive month , each month broke the previous monthly all-rime record high temperature . Using autoregressive intervention moving average ( ARMA ) model in a series of Monte Carlo experiment the probability of such an event wa analyzed for various rate of temperature change . The string of record-breaking global temperature could not be readily explained by the best fit linear increase of temperature since the late 1970 's ( 2 degree C/Century ) , although the event wa not implausible ( probability slightly le than 5 % ) . The 1997-98 event could signal yet another change point in the rate of global temperature increase , but the warming rate over the past few decade is already comparable to that projected during the 21st Century based on IPCC business a usual scenario of anthropogenic climate change ( Kattenberg ct al. , 1996 ) .

aVWe examine the seasonal cycle of near-surface air temperature simulated by 17 coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project ( CMIP ) . Nine of the model use ad hoc `` flux adjustment '' at the ocean surface to bring model simulation close to observation of the present-day climate . We group flux-adjusted and non-flux-adjusted model separately and examine the behaviol- of each class . When averaged over all of the flux-adjusted model simulation , near-surface air temperature fall within 2 K of observed value over the ocean . The corresponding average over non-flux-adjusted model show error up to similar to6 K in extensive ocean area . Flux adjustment are not directly applied over land , and near-surface land temperature error are substantial in the average over flux-adjusted model , which systematically underestimate ( by similar to5 K ) temperature in area of elevated terrain . The corresponding average over non-flux-adjusted model form a similar error pattern ( with somewhat increased amplitude ) over land . We use the temperature difference between July and January to measure seasonal cycle amplitude . Zonal mean of this quantity from the individual flux-adjusted model form a fairly tight cluster ( all within similar to 30 % of the mean ) centered on the observed value . The nonflux-adjusted model perform nearly a well at most latitude . In Southern Ocean mid-latitudes , however , the non-flux-adjusted model overestimate the magnitude of January-minus-July temperature difference by similar to5 K due to an overestimate of summer ( January ) near-surface temperature . This error is common to five of the eight non-flux-adjusted model . Also , over Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude land area , zonal mean difference between July and January temperature simulated by the non-flux-adjusted model show a greater spread ( positive and negative ) about observed value than result from the flux-adjusted model . Elsewhere , difference between the two class of model are le obvious . At no latitude is the zonal mean difference between average over the two class of model greater than the standard deviation over model . The ability of coupled GCMs to simulate a reasonable seasonal cycle is a necessary condition for confidence in their prediction of long-term climatic change ( such a global warming ) , but it is not a sufficient condition unless the seasonal cycle and long-term change involve similar climatic process . To test this possible connection , we compare seasonal cycle amplitude with equilibrium warming under doubled atmospheric carbon dioxide for the model in our data base . A small but positive correlation exists between these two quantity . This result is predicted by a simple conceptual model of the climate system , and it is consistent with other modeling experience , which indicates that the seasonal cycle depends only weakly on climate sensitivity .

aVA complex regulatory system now governs the privatised water industry in England and Wales . There is now a key question a to whether this system is adequate to ensure that the government 's aim of sustainability can be achieved . Sustainability policy need to be considered in the light of the international , European and national initiative , and many of these will impact on the water industry in England and Wales . Two area are highlighted a of particular importance . The first concern water resource and how water abstraction , leakage and flooding can be controlled alongside the corresponding uncertainty of global warming . Second , the issue of bathing water quality demonstrates problem of financing improvement programme , and the adequacy of current programme in ensuring a cleaner bathing water environment for the next generation . The issue have to be considered alongside the mechanism and procedure for reaching decision under the present regulatory framework . These decision-making structure will prove central to any robust sustainability for the water industry .

aVLife Cycle Assessment ha been used to compare the environmental performance of landfilling of the zinc used for galvanising steel with recycling by a number process . Hypothetical process route were composed involving three different EAF dust treatment process , Waelz kiln , DC-furnace , and EZINEX , a well a scrap dezincing . The study show that recycling of zinc used for galvanising steel clearly ha environmental benefit in that it save zinc resource . However , zinc recovery doe not necessarily decrease the potential impact on global warming and acidification . The magnitude of these two impact category is tightly correlated with the amount and type of primary energy consumed in a process . Due to the high electricity consumption in the dezincing process , this route ha the highest impact on Global Warming Potential a well a Acidification Potential . The major part of the energy requirement for the production of zinc from primary and secondary source is consumed in the reduction of ZnO to Zn . The consequence is that the theoretically possible saving in primary energy by recycling zinc-containing material is relatively small . The impact category land use and waste generation are not considered in this study , but most likely the evaluation of such impact would further increase the potential environmental impact of the landfill alternative . The result also show that the location of an electricity-intensive process highly affect the potential environmental impact . Comparing process and material alternative in LCA study where branch average data is used is therefore considerably more complex than when ICA is used within a company .

aVThe variation in graminoid specie composition and diversity and the distribution of photosynthetic pathway among 66 wetland in KwaZulu-Natal , South Africa , and within six of these wetland wa described and related to measured physical parameter , using multivariate and univariate technique . Altitude , which ranged from 550 m to 2120 m , accounted for most variation among wetland , with an almost complete turnover of specie along this gradient . Landform setting wa le important in explaining overall specie composition , but relationship of individual specie were revealed ( e.g . Eleocharis dregeana showed an affinity for depression ) . Within a wetland there wa an almost complete turnover of specie along a gradient of wetness , a described using soil morphological criterion . Most specie were consistently associated with the same wetness zone across different wetland site , e.g. , Phragmites australis with the wettest zone , Pycreus macranthus with the intermediate zone , and Eragrostis plana with the least wet zone . The occurrence and abundance of different photosynthetic pathway type depended on altitude and degree of wetness . At high altitude , C-3 sedge , notably Carex acutiformis , dominated the wettest zone and C-3 and C-4 grass and sedge dominated the intermediate and least wet zone . At mid altitude , C-3 and C-4 sedge and C-3 grass dominated the wettest zone , C-3 and C-4 grass and sedge dominated the intermediate zone and C-4 grass dominated the least wet zone . Low altitude site showed a similar distribution of photosynthetic pathway a mid-altitude site , but C-3 specie were le abundant . Species richness wa positively associated with the log of wetland size and , at the level of an individual wetland , specie richness and evenness were found to be consistently greater in the intermediate and least wet zone compared with the wettest zone . The management implication of the result are discussed in the light of continuing anthropogenic loss of wetland in the study area and global climate change .

aVMany study have been made of the water vapor feedback , in both satellite data and climate model simulation . Most infer the magnitude of the feedback from the variability present in geographical distribution of the key variable , or from their seasonal variation , often using data only over the ocean . It is argued that a more direct measure of the feedback should come from the interannual variability of global mean quantity , because this timescale and space scale is more appropriate for such a global phenomenon . To investigate this suggestion , the feedback derived from the simulation of clear-sky longwave flux ( CLERA ) , which used data from the 15-yr reanalysis project of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts , is compared with simulation by the latest version of the Hadley Centre climate model . Results are taken from an integration of the atmosphere-only version of the climate model with prescribed sea surface temperature , a well a from a control and a global warming simulation by the coupled ocean-atmosphere version . There is broad consistency between the result from CLERA and the climate model a to the strength of the feedback , although there is considerable scatter in the CLERA result . The signal of change in the well-mixed greenhouse gas is weak in CLERA but is dominant in the global warming simulation and ha to be removed in order to diagnose the water vapor feedback . This result ha implication for the exploitation of long time series of satellite and other data to study this and other feedback .

aVIncrease in water temperature from an ambient of 15 degree C to 20 and 25 degree C increased the respiration rate in zebra mussel , Dreissena polymorpha , by 50 and 175 % , respectively , and increased the toxicity of copper ; a 48-hour lethal concentration to kill 50 % of the organism ( LC50 ) of 775 mu g/L at 20 degree C decreased to 238 mu g/L at 25 degree C , and a 96-hour LC50 of 487 mu g/L at 20 degree C reduced to 107 mu g/L at 25 degree C. The oxygen consumption rate in the presence of 150 mu g/L copper decreased by 16 % at 20 degree C and by 50 % at 25 degree C. Thus , high temperature may increase the toxicity of copper , and possibly other metal , to zebra mussel . Similar increase in heavy metal toxicity may also accompany global warming , which is expected to raise surface water temperature by 2 to 3 degree C. Such temperature and heavy metal combination may also be useful in designing field trial to control this nuisance specie .

aVImpulse-response-function ( IRF ) model are designed for application requiring a large number of climate change simulation , such a multi-scenario climate impact study or cost-benefit integrated-assessment study . The model apply linear response theory to reproduce the characteristic of the climate response to external forcing computed with sophisticated state-of-the-art climate model like general circulation model of the physical ocean-atmosphere system and three-dimensional oceanic-plus-terrestrial carbon cycle model . Although highly computer efficient , IRF model are nonetheless capable of reproducing the full set of climate-change information generated by the complex model against which they are calibrated . While limited in principle to the linear response regime ( le than about 3 degreesC global-mean temperature change ) , the applicability of the IRF model presented ha been extended into the nonlinear domain through explicit treatment of the climate system 's dominant nonlinearities : CO2 chemistry in ocean water , CO2 fertilization of land biota , and sublinear radiative forcing . The resultant nonlinear impulse-response model of the coupled carbon cycle-climate system ( NICCS ) computes the temporal evolution of spatial pattern of climate change for four climate variable of particular relevance for climate impact study : near-surface temperature , cloud cover , precipitation , and sea level . The space-time response characteristic of the model are derived from an EOF analysis of a transient 850-year greenhouse warming simulation with the Hamburg atmosphere-ocean general circulation model ECHAM3-LSG and a similar response experiment with the Hamburg carbon cycle model HAMOCC . The model is applied to two long-term CO2 emission scenario , demonstrating that the use of all currently estimated fossil fuel resource would carry the Earth 's climate far beyond the range of climate change for which reliable quantitative prediction are possible today , and that even a freezing of emission to present-day level would cause a major global warming in the long term .

aVA portion of the southeastern United States is currently experiencing the most severe drought on record . Rainfall deficit accumulated since 1998 have led to a twofold increase in mean annual salinity in the study area , a wetland landbridge located in the Lake Pontchartrain Estuary in southeastern Louisiana . Global circulation model have predicted a rise in both the frequency and amplitude of extreme weather if global warming continues . This indicates a-threat to the stability of deltaic plain , particularly those with altered hydrology . Throughout the Mississippi River Deltaic Plain , river control structure have eliminated freshwater input . Generally , this should lead to increase in salinity that can become particularly acute during drought event . Such condition have been shown to play a decisive role in plant community ecology , an important force in deltaic plain stability , Beyond certain threshold , these condition can have detrimental effect upon primary production . The accumulation of primary production deficit may lead to increase in the rate of relative sea-level rise . Though the drought is not proven to be the result of global warming , this event show that coastal ecology is sensitive to drought condition and any increase will be detrimental to floodplain stability .

aVWhile the international community ha yet to achieve a consensus on the operational detail of implementing the Kyoto Protocol , the rapidly increasing consumption of fossil fuel and the CO , emission produced in the industrializing developing country further obscure the prospect for combating global warming . This study analyzes the problem of energy utilization in Taiwan a an illustrative example , and explores the strategy for increasing the market penetration of wind power in the traditional energy structure dominated by fossil fuel and nuclear energy . Decentrally produced wind power would contribute to establishing an autonomous and disaster-resilient power supply system . Replacing partial coal-based power generation with the full exploitation of wind energy would result in annual reduction of 9.8 million ton of CO , in Taiwan . The key barrier to utilizing wind energy lie mainly in the lack of political impetus and a framework for promoting renewable energy in Taiwan . Priority task to allow wind power to penetrate the energy market include establishing legislative prioritization for renewable energy , setting premium price for power from wind turbine , providing direct support of investment cost , raising awareness , etc .

aVSpecies are commonly segregated along gradient of microclimate and vegetation . I explore the question of whether segregation is the result of microhabitat partitioning ( biotic effect ) or choice of differing microclimates ( abiotic effect ) . I explored this question for four ground-nesting bird specie that an segregated along a microclimate and vegetation gradient in Arizona . Birds shifted position of their nest on the microhabitat and microclimate gradient in response to changing precipitation over nine year . Similarly , annual bird abundance varied with precipitation across 12 yr. Those shift in abundance and nesting microhabitat with changing precipitation demonstrate the importance of abiotic influence on bird distribution and habitat choice . However , nest-site shift and microhabitat use also appear to be influenced by interaction among coexisting specie . Moreover , shift in habitat use by all specie caused nest predation ( i.e. , biotic ) cost that increased with increasing distance along the microclimate gradient . These result indicate that abiotic and biotic cost can strongly interact to influence microhabitat choice and abundance of coexisting specie . Global climate change impact have been considered largely in term of simple distributional shift , but these result indicate that shift can also increase biotic cost when specie move into habitat type for which they are poorly adapted or that create new biotic interaction .

aVAgricultural emission of NH3 , N2O , and CH4 come , to a large extent , from common source . It ha been demonstrated that controlling NH3 emission through application of technical measure might have an impact on emission of N2O and CH4 . This paper present estimate of NH3 , N2O and CH4 emission from European agriculture for 1990 and four scenario for the year 2010 . The first scenario assumes no specific NH3 abatement , but emission of all three gas decline between 1990 and 2010 a a result of projected reduction in animal number and fertiliser consumption in Europe . The other three scenario assume different level of NH3 abatement in Europe , including the maximum feasible reduction case . They are compared with respect to their effect on emission of N2O and CH4 . The result indicate that in Europe , abating agricultural emission of NH3 may cause release of N2O from this sector up to 15 % higher than in the case of no NH3 control . There may be substantial difference in the observed effect between various country depending on the degree and type of NH3 control option applied . The effect of NH3 abatement on CH4 emission wa found to be negligible . c , 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All right reserved .

aVTo adequately ass the effect of atmospheric aerosol on climate , their optical constant ( scattering and absorption coefficient ) must be known . The absorption and scattering coefficient of the aerosol are derived from the real and imaginary part of the complex refractive index and are dependent on their size and chemical composition . Because aerosol property vary significantly with location , it is difficult to assign value for the absorption and scattering of solar radiation by aerosol in model of global climate change , This study report a new method of collecting size-fractionated atmospheric aerosol sample for the purpose of directly measuring their transmission and reflectance spectrum followed by the determination of the complex refractive index across the entire atmospherically relevant spectral range . The sample were collected with a modified Sierra high-volume cascade impactor with the usual filter collection surface replaced with Teflon sheet machined to hold quartz ( ultraviolet [ UV ] /visible transparent ) and/or silver chloride ( infrared transparent ) sample collection plate . Reflectance and transmission spectrum can be obtained on the aerosol sample directly a a function of wavelength , from 280 mn to 2.5 mum , with an integrating sphere coupled to an UV/visible or a Fourier transform infrared ( FTIR ) spectrophotometer . The effective real and imaginary component of the refractive index of the bulk sample material can then be approximated , a a function of wavelength , from the sample spectrum , preliminary result are presented for carbon soot sample generated in the laboratory and for standard diesel soot sample in the UV/visible spectral range . These are compared to result obtained for size-fractionated atmospheric aerosol sample collected near Pasco , WA , West Mesa , AZ , and Argonne , IL .

aVThis study present an empirical model based on la GIS approach , which wa constructed to estimate the large-scale carbon flux over the entire Russian tundra zone . The model ha four main block : ( i ) the computer map of tundra landscape ; ( ii ) data base of long-term weather record ; ( iii ) the submodel of phytomass seasonal dynamic ; and ( iv ) the submodel of carbon flux . The model us exclusively original in situ diurnal CO2 flux chamber measurement ( 423 sample plot ) conducted during six field season ( 1993-98 ) . The research site represent the main tundra biome landscape ( arctic , typical , south shrub and mountain tundra ) in the latitudinal diapason of 65-74 degreesN and longitudinal profile of 63 degreesE-172 degreesW . The greatest possible diversity of major ecosystem type within the different landscape wa investigated . The majority of the phytomass data used wa obtained from the same sample plot . The submodel of carbon flux ha two dependent [ GPP , Gross Respiration ( GR ) I and several input variable lair temperature , PAR , aboveground phytomass component ) . The model demonstrates a good correspondence with other independent regional and biome estimate and carbon flux seasonal pattern . The annual GPP of Russian tundra zone for the area of 235x10 ( 6 ) ha wa estimated a -485.8+/-34.6x10 ( 6 ) tC , GR a +474.2 +/- 35.0x10 ( 6 ) tC , and NF a -11.6 +/- 40.8x10 ( 6 ) tC , which possibly corresponds to an equilibrium state of carbon balance during the climatic period studied ( the first half of the 20th century ) . The result advocate that simple regression-based model are useful for extrapolating carbon flux from small to large spatial scale .

aVAlthough the super cold separator applied to the system for CO2 recovery from flue gas can produce pure CO2 liquid , the CO2 recovery efficiency is low . Therefore , the addition of a PSA plant wa considered for the secondary CO2 recovery from the noncondensing gas to improve the efficiency . The PSA plant wa operated for adsorption at the same pressure a that of the super cold separator and for desorption at the atmospheric pressure . From both the simulation and the experimental data , it wa confirmed that CO2 could be concentrated from 50 % in the noncondensing gas to 70 % in the recovery gas by the PSA plant and the CO2 recovery efficiency of the plant wa about 90 % .

aVPhragmites australis wetland act a a sink for greenhouse gas by photosynthetic assimilation of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) from the atmosphere and sequestration of the organic matter produced in the wetland soil . The wetland also act a a source for greenhouse gas by emission of sediment-produced methane ( CH4 ) to the atmosphere . In P. australis wetland , the dominant mechanism of CH4 release to the atmosphere is internal gas transport in the plant , primarily by pressurized convective gas flow . The time period of carbon fixation and CH4 release therefore vary seasonally and diurnally . The balance between net CO2-assimilation and CH4 emission determines if a wetland can be regarded a a net sink or a net source of greenhouse gas , and hence , the function of the wetland in relation to global climate change . On an annual basis up to 15 % of the net carbon fixed by the wetland may be released to the atmosphere a CH4 . Because of the different infrared absorption characteristic and atmospheric longevity of CH4 and CO2 , the warming effect of CH4 in the atmosphere is about 21 time higher on a mass basis than CO2 over a 100-year timescale . Thus , the immediate carbon balance , coupled with the different physical characteristic of the two gas , would suggest that although some wetland function a a net sink for CO. the wetland still increase the greenhouse effect because of their release of CH4 . However , the short adjustment time for CH4 in the atmosphere mean that , over a longer time scale , the radiative forcing of CH4 is le relative to CO2 and the wetland effectively become a sink for greenhouse gas . Wetlands may therefore be regarded a a source for greenhouse gas and so increase radiative forcing if evaluated on a short time scale ( decade ) , but a a sink for greenhouse gas and thus attenuating radiative forcing if evaluated over longer time scale ( > 100 year ) .

aVThe vapour phase reaction of perfluoropropene , CF3 - CF = CF2 , and perfluorobuta-1,3-diene , CF2=CF-CF=CF2 , with OH , NO3 and O-3 were studied at 298 +/- 4K and 740 +/- 5 Torr using long-path FT-IR detection . The reaction with ozone are very slow , k ( CF3CFCF2+O3 ) = ( 6.2 +/- 1.5 ) x 10 ( -22 ) and k ( CF2CFCFCF2+O3 ) = ( 6.5 +/- 0.2 ) x 10 ( -21 ) cm ( 3 ) Molecules ( -1 ) s ( -1 ) , and upper limit of 3 x 10 ( -15 ) cm ( 3 ) molecule ( -1 ) s ( -1 ) are reported for the NO3 reaction rate coefficient . The OH reaction rate coefficient were determined a k ( CF3CFCF2+OH ) = ( 2.6 +/- 0.7 ) x 10 ( -12 ) and k ( CF2CFCFCF2+OH ) = ( 1.1 +/- 0.3 ) x 10 ( -11 ) cm ( 3 ) molecule ( -1 ) s ( -1 ) ; perfluoropropene gave a nearly quantitative yield of CF3CFO and CF2O a organic product , while perfluorobuta-1,3-diene gave from 130 % to 170 % of CF2O . A chemistry transport model wa applied to calculate the atmospheric distribution and lifetime of the perfluoroalkenes ; the global and yearly averaged lifetime were calculated a 1.9 day for C2F4 and C4F6 and 6 day for C3F6 . Quantitative infrared cross-sections of perfluoroethene , perfluoropropene , and perfluorobuta-1,3-diene have been obtained at 298 K in the region 100-2600 cm ( -1 ) . Radiative forcing calculation have been performed for these gas assuming either constant vertical profile or the distribution derived from the chemistry transport model . The result show that the Global Warming Potentials are totally negligible for these compound . ( C ) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All right reserved .

aVUncertainty about the role of forestry and land-use change in mitigating global warming is addressed using a possibilistic linear programming model of forest and agricultural land management . The objective is to maximize the cumulative net discounted return in the two sector , while meeting specific carbon-uptake goal and maintaining stable flow of timber over the planning horizon . Because of ambiguity related to timber yield and carbon parameter , and vagueness of policy target ( economic return , timber production and carbon-uptake ) , ordinal measure of uncertainty are applied . While ordinality entail loss of precision , it make it possible to solve complex problem . This paper compare land-use policy in the boreal forest zone of Northeastern British Columbia under uncertainty with those from a more typical scenario that applies best-guess parameter value . Including uncertainty explicitly into the possibility analysis change optimal land-use and forest management , and lead to different level of projected timber supply , economic performance and carbon sequestration . The amount of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) removed from the atmosphere and the economic cost of carbon uptake are sensitive to how the decision-maker tackle uncertainty . ( C ) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

aVGlobal warming is thought to result from emission largely caused by combustion reaction . Designs of burner and specification of their material are therefore of primary importance in restraining the warming phenomenon . This paper proposes a new type of ceramic burner which incorporates many of the innovation which are needed to improve burner performance , including catalytic combustion , premixed fuel/air , recuperation of combustion heat , recycling of reaction product , electric-ignition and electron extraction . The key problem of fuel variation and thermal shock resistance of the ceramic are addressed through the concept of 'reaction gradient ' in which the rich sequence of oxidation reaction during combustion is spread through three extended catalytic regime along the isothermal ceramic device . It is evident that ceramic burner are necessary to provide catalytic activity and to promote electron transfer . The conclusion is that ceramic will ultimately replace metal in burner requiring low emission and high exergy output . ( C ) 2001 Kluwer Academic Publishers .

aVThe advent of the global warming crisis ha brought about a viewpoint , in many government , that the halogen family of refrigerant should be replaced , in part or in toto , by the so-called natural refrigerant , For this proposal to be valid it is necessary to consider both the refrigerant 's direct environmental impact and it life-long performance under field condition . This is particularly true in the case of global warming because , for most application , it is the heat pump 's operating efficiency and it impact on the central power plant 's emission that is the dominating environmental factor . Any refrigerant must also meet a variety of other criterion that deal with durability , safety and cost . A simple comparison of basic fluid property is conducted to indicate what system design consideration must be made if a refrigerant is to become an acceptable alternative . It is also reasoned that while computer model and laboratory prototype are a necessary beginning , they are not sufficient to determine the true environmental impact of any system . Finally , the question is raised a to whether the refrigerant specification approach is the better path to an improved environment or if it is wiser to leave all option open for researcher and manufacturer to meet an environmental performance standard any way they choose .

aVThe African Sahel provides the most dramatic example of multi-decadal climate variability that ha been quantitatively and directly measured . Annual rainfall across this region fell by between 20 and 30 per cent between the decade leading up to political independence for the Sahelian nation ( 1930s to 1950s ) and the decade since ( 1970s to 1990s ) . Climatic perspective on the nature and cause of this period of desiccation have changed and , in some case , matured a the year - and the drought - continued . This paper review these changing perspective and reflects on three central question : How unique an occurrence ha been this desiccation in the recent human history of the Sahel ? Can we find an adequate explanation for this desiccation in the natural force that shape the climate system , or do we have to implicate human intervention in the system ? Is our understanding of climate variability sufficient to allow u to develop seasonal rainfall forecasting capability for the region ? ( C ) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All right reserved .

aVTwo dynamically and statistically downscaled precipitation scenario for Sweden are compared with respect to change in the mean , The dynamically downscaled scenario are generated by a 44 km version of the Rossby Centre regional climate model ( RCM ) . The RCM is driven by data from 2 global greenhouse gas simulation sharing a 2.6degreesC global warming , one made by the HadCM2 and the other by the ECHAM4 general circulation model ( GCM ) . The statistical downscaling model driven by the same GCMs is regression-based and incorporates large-scale circulation index of the 2 geostrophic wind component ( u and v ) , total vorticity ( xi ) and large-scale humidity at 850 hPa ( q850 ) a predictor . The precipitation climate of the GCMs , RCMs and statistical model from the control run are compared with respect to their ability to reproduce the observed seasonal cycle . Great improvement in the simulation of the seasonal cycle by all the downscaling model compared to the GCMs significantly increase the credibility of the downscaling model , The precipitation change produced by the statistical model result from change in all predictor , but the change in 4 is the greatest contributor in southern Sweden followed by q850 and u , while change in q850 have greater effect in the northern part of the country . The temporal and spatial variability of precipitation change are higher in the statistically downscaled scenario than in the dynamically downscaled one . Comparisons of the 4 scenario show that the spread of the scenario created by the statistical model is on average larger than that between the RCM scenario . The relatively large average spread is mainly due to the large difference found in summer . The seasonally averaged difference of the dynamical and statistical scenario for the ECHAM4-based downscaled scenario is 12 % , and for the HadCM2 downscaled scenario 21 % . The difference in annual precipitation change are smaller , on average 4.5 % among the HadCM2-based downscaled scenario , and 6.9 % among the ECHAM4-based downscaling scenario .

aVNew Zealand 's four broad-leaved evergreen tree specie from the genus Nothofagus all show pronounced distributional disjunction , independent of environmental factor known to influence tree distribution . Here , we use these disjunction a the basis for a natural removal experiment to investigate competitive interaction between Nothofagus and a range of other widespread conifer and broad-leaved tree specie . We first model the abundance of non-Nothofagus specie a a function of environment , using Generalized Additive Models ( GAMs ) and an extensive data set sampling much of New Zealand 's remaining old-growth forest . We then ass the effect of competitive interaction with Nothofagus by adding statistical term describing ( 1 ) Nothofagus abundance , and ( 2 ) interaction between Nothofagus abundance and annual temperature , the dominant environmental gradient . Results indicate substantial reduction in the abundance of many specie a Nothofagus abundance increase . The magnitude of this reduction varies with position along the dominant environmental gradient ; specie overlapping most strongly with Nothofagus are generally most sensitive to increase in Nothofagus abundance . In addition , both the shape of specie response to mean annual temperature and the position of their optimum change a Nothofagus abundance increase . This demonstration of competition using community compositional data ha implication both for vegetation theory and for prediction of the likely impact of global warming on New Zealand 's forest pattern .

aVLoess deposit in eastern Beringia contain continuous proxy record of the effect of past climatic change on terrestrial landscape at high latitude . Variations of environmental magnetism and sedimentology of high-latitude loess deposit indicate that the timing and pattern of response to local variation in wind intensity , storminess , and pedogenesis in eastern Beringia closely resemble the pattern of global climate change during the Late Quaternary deduced from study of marine and ice core record . The age of paleoclimatic fluctuation , permafrost feature , volcanic ash horizon , buried forest layer and paleosols , and other feature of the eastern Beringian loess record can be determined using a variety of Quaternary dating method . Tephrochronologic correlation between the loess record and the glacial history of eastern Beringia indicate the Delta Glaciation occurred during marine isotope stage 6 . Several other middle and Late Quaternary glaciation across eastern Beringia can be tephrochronologically tied to the loess record , and appear to have been in phase with episode of global cooling recorded in deep-sea record .

aVSea surface temperature were warmer throughout 1998 at Sesolto Island , Japan , than in the 10 preceding year . Temperatures peaked at 2.8 degreesC : above average , resulting in extensive coral bleaching and subsequent coral mortality . Using random quadrat survey , we quantitatively documented the coral community structure one year before and one year after the bleaching event . The 1998 bleaching event reduced coral specie richness by 61 % and reduced coral cover by 85 % . Colony morphology affected bleaching vulnerability and subsequent coral mortality . Finely branched coral were most susceptible , while massive and encrusting colony survived . Most heavily impacted mere the branched Acropora and pocilloporid coral , some of which showed local extinction . we suggest two hypothesis whose synergistic effect may partially explain observed mortality pattern ( i.e . preferential survival of thick-tissued specie , and shape-dependent difference in colon ) mass-transfer efficiency ) . A community-structural shift occurred on Okinawan reef , resulting in an increase in the relative abundance of massive and encrusting coral specie .

aVTo date , most of the focus on greenhouse gas emission reduction ha been on energy-related CO2 emission . This is understandable since CO2 emission currently account for about 82 percent of the total US greenhouse gas emission weighted by 100-year global warming potential ( EPA , www.epa.gov/globalwarming/publications/emissions , 2001a ) . ( 1 ) However , a number of analysis suggest that the non-CO2 greenhouse gas included in the Kyoto Protocol-methane , nitrous oxide , and the high-GWP ( global warming potential ) gas ( HFCs , PFCs , and SF6 ) -can make a significant contribution to cost-effective emission reduction for the US and other country . Our current estimate for the US is a reduction in non-CO2 emission of 105 million metric ton of carbon equivalent ( MMTCE ) at $ 50/ton carbon equivalent in 2010 . This paper provides a perspective on the current and projected emission of greenhouse gas ; outline the potential method for achieving emission reduction for various source ; and summarizes several recent study on the cost of reduction for the US and other country . Although the paper doe not specifically address the potential for reduction of these gas in individual country outside the US and the European Union , it finding are generally applicable to many country .

aVThe impact of ground hydrology on the high-latitude ocean , such a melting glacier and discharge from river into the ocean , can affect global climate by mediating the flow of low-density , fresh water inflow that strengthens the ocean 's stratification . This suppresses the thermohaline circulation , and also promotes sea-ice formation . Our time series analysis based on sea-ice and river-discharge data indicates that the effect of this fresh water on the sea-ice in the Okhotsk Sea , into which the second largest Siberian River , the Amur , discharge , is relatively unimportant . Interannual variation in the ice extent are negatively correlated with the amount of discharge . We find circumstantial evidence that the inflow of warmer river water tends to raise the sea surface temperature , and that it suppresses ice formation in the following winter . This potential explanation for the negative correlation implies that sensible heat transported by large river in high latitude should be reconsidered in studying global climate change .

aVWith crude oil at $ 30.00 per barrel , bioethanol is a viable fuel alternative . Bioethanol is clean burning , ha high octane number , is renewable and doe not contribute to global warming . However , in the absence of tax credit , the production of bioethanol is le attractive . A determination of return-on-investment wa carried out based on test to optimise the co-production of bioethanol and a high-value product , glycerol . Using corn or mile ( grain sorghum ) a the raw material , the return-on-investment increase from 12.3 % ( bioethanol ) to 19.7 % ( bioethanol plus glycerol ) . When blackstrap molasses is the raw material , the return-on-investment increase from 12.8 % ( bioethanol ) to 22.3 % ( bioethanol plus glycerol ) . Therefore , value-added product such a glycerol are the key to making fuel ethanol plant profitable now and in the future .

aVSome argue that global climate change may alter the frequency and strength of extreme event . This paper examines the economic damage in the agricultural sector arising from a shift in El Nino Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) event frequency and strength . The assumption about the frequency of ENSO shift are motivated by an article by Timmermann et al . ( 1999 ) . The damage estimate reported here are in the context of the global agricultural system . Annual damage in the 3 to 4 hundred million U.S. dollar range are found if only the frequency of ENSO event change . However , annual damage rise to over $ 1 billion if the event also intensify in strength . Event anticipation and crop mix adaption on the part of farmer can help offset the damage but can not fully alleviate them .

aVA majority of the beef cattle and swine in the United States is produced in confined facility . This generates significant environmental pollutant from the waste produced , including global warming gas , odor , and pathogen . The objective of this study were to control the fermentation activity and pathogen in cattle and swine waste with antimicrobial plant essential oil . Anaerobic one litre flask with a working volume of 0.5 l were used to evaluate the effect of carvacrol and thymol on production of fermentation gas , short-chain volatile fatty acid , lactate , and bacterial population . In cattle waste , 1 gl ( -1 ) each of carvacrol and thymol completely inhibited the production of volatile fatty acid and lactate over 23 day . In swine waste , 2.5 gl ( -1 ) carvacrol inhibited the production of all volatile fatty acid . We conclude that these essential oil are effective in controlling livestock waste odor emission and field study are warranted .

aVAlthough climate change and it implication are a frequent subject of detailed study , the effect of these change on specie ' geographic distribution remain little explored . We present a first cross-species analysis of the effect of global climate change on the distribution of one bird family , the Cracidae , in Mexico , based on projecting model of ecological niche from present condition to modeled future condition taken from general circulation model of climate change . Based on two different scenario of climate change and on three assumption regarding specie ' dispersal ability , effect on specie ' distribution range from drastic reduction to modest increase . These result illustrate the complex nature of specie ' geographic response to environmental change , and emphasize the need for detailed analysis of individual specie ' ecological requirement .

aVThe evolution of thinking about energy is discussed . When the author began collaborating 20 year ago , energy wa typically considered from a growth-oriented , supply-side perspective , with a focus on consumption trend and how to expand supply to meet rising demand . They were deeply troubled by the environmental , security and equity implication of that approach . For instance , about two billion people lack access to affordable modern energy seriously limiting their opportunity for a better life . And energy is a significant contributor to environmental problem , including indoor air pollution , urban air pollution , acidification , and global warming . The author saw the need to evolve a different perspective in which energy is provided in way that help solve such serious problem . They argued that energy must become an instrument for advancing sustainable development-economically viable , need-oriented , self-reliant and environmentally sound development-and that the focus should be on the end us of energy and the service that energy provides . Energy technological option that can help meet sustainable development goal are discussed . The necessity of developing and employing innovative technological solution is stressed . The possibility of technological leapfrogging that could enable developing country to avoid repeating the mistake of the industrialized country is illustrated with a discussion of ethanol in Brazil . The role foreign direct investment might play in bringing advanced technology to developing country is highlighted . Near-and long-term strategy for rural energy are discussed . Finally , policy issue are considered for evolving the energy system so that it will be consistent with and supportive of sustainable development .

aVA Life Cycle Assessment , LCA , of a nanocrystalline dye sensitized solar cell ( ncDSC ) system ha been performed , according to the ISO14040 standard . In brief , LCA is a tool to analyse the total environmental impact of a product or system from cradle to grave . Six different weighing method were used to rank and select the significant environmental aspect to study further . The most significant environmental aspect according to the weighing method are emission of sulphur dioxide and carbon dioxide . Carbon dioxide emission wa selected a the environmental indicator depending on the growing attention on the global warming effect . In an environmental comparison of electricity generation from a ncDSC system and a natural gas/combined cycle power plant , the gas power plant would result in 450 g CO2/kWh and the ncDSC system in between 19-47 g CO2/kWh . The latter can be compared with 42 g CO2/kWh , according to van Brummelen et al . `` Life Cycle Assessment of Roof Integrated Solar Cell Systems , ( Report : Department of Science , Technology and Society , Utrecht University , The Netherlands , 1994 ) '' for another thin film solar eel system made of amorphous silicon . The most significant activity/component contributing to environmental impact over the Life cycle of the ncDSC system is the process energy for producing the solar cell module . Secondly come the component ; glass substrate , frame and junction box . The main improvement from an environmental point of view of the current technology would be an increase in the conversion efficiency from solar radiation to electricity generation and still use low energy demanding production technology . Also the amount of material in the solar cell system should be minimised and designed to maximise recycling . ( C ) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All right reserved .

aVThe need for the Chilean government to adopt a position vis-a-vis negotiation at the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change prompt a preliminary analysis in this paper of the result of reduction of greenhouse gas ( GHG ) and their cost For Chile . Basically , two sector offer possibility to contribute to the control of CO2 emission . In the energy sector , CO2 emission can be abated by either adopting more efficient technology or switching fuel . In the non-energy sector , CO2 emission can be sequestered from the atmosphere by afforestation , reforestation and forest management . This work represent the first effort in Chile to estimate the cost of CO2 abatement and sequestration for Chile using a bottom-up approach for the year 2010 , which in a global warming context is a short/medium term scenario . In the energy sector , the end and intermediate us of energy are considered for the transportation , manufacturing and electricity sector . In the non-energy sector , sequestration cost incurred in forestation on marginal land available in each administrative region of Chile are estimated . Our preliminary result indicate that Chile ha a large potential to become a net remover of GHG emission , with a 176 % of CO2 equivalent reduction attainable by 2010 under the upper-bound scenario . A 7 % CO2 abatement can be achieved at apparently no cost to society with increased efficiency in the use of energy , and a 114 % abatement can be achieved at moderate cost , i.e. , le than 11 US $ /ton CO2 eq . The major reduction is obtainable through CO2 sequestration by forest . ( C ) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd .

aVRecent Ocean Drilling Program ( ODP ) result in the Oregon accretionary prism and on the Blake Ridge indicate that the zone containing free gas beneath the hydrate-bearing near-surface sediment is considerably thicker than previously thought . In this paper , we present result from travel time inversion of refracted seismic wave that show very low ( 12 compared to Q ( P ) > 100 in the `` normal '' accretionary complex sediment west of Hydrate Ridge . These result suggest that refraction seismic technique are a powerful way to constrain the depth to which free gas is present in sediment beneath the hydrate stability zone . Defining the extent of the free gas zone is an important factor for estimating the total volume of gas present and for evaluating it impact on slope stability and potential contribution to global climate change .

aVThe goal of the work presented in this article wa to provide a preliminary screening for a novel fluorinated compound , oxalyl fluoride , C ( 2 ) O ( 2 ) F ( 2 ) ( F- ( C=O ) - ( C=O ) -F ) , a a potential replacement for perfluorocompounds in dielectric etch application . Both process and emission data were collected and the result were compared to those provided by a process utilizing a standard perfluorinated etch chemistry ( C ( 2 ) F ( 6 ) ) . In this evaluation , oxalyl fluoride produced very low quantity of global warming compound under the condition in which it wa tested , a compared to the C2F6 process . A preliminary evaluation of the compound 's process performance wa 's also carried out . Patterned tetraethoxysilane-deposited silicon oxide masked with deep UV photoresist having 0.6 , 0.45 , and 0.35 mum via hole feature wa used a the test vehicle . Although C ( 2 ) O ( 2 ) F ( 2 ) wa capable of etching silicon dioxide , low oxide etch rate and poor selectivity to the mask layer were observed . Finally , in addition to the experimental work performed , a set of ab initio quantum chemical calculation wa undertaken to obtain enthalpy of dissociation for each of the bond in the oxalyl fluoride molecule in order to better understand it dissociation pathway in plasma environment .

aVWood and other construction material often use environmental argument in their marketing . Usually , these claim are based on life cycle assessment ( LCAs ) or material flow analysis , and the information that can be derived from these procedure is mainly related to emission ( acidification , global warming , eutrophication , formation of oxidant ) , energy consumption and amount of raw material transported and used . There is a glaring gap : renewability .

aVThe degradation of organic matter in peat bog is complex and not yet well understood . Recent investigation of the trace gas CO2 and CH4 focussed on the impact of these greenhouse gas on global warming . However , there have to be metabolic intermediate between complex organic structure ( i.e. , humic acid ) and gaseous end product ( CH4 , CO2 N-2 , NOx and H2S ) other than water-soluble substance ( i.e. , aromatic acid , amino acid , fatty acid ) . Deoxygenation during microbial decomposition of plant material also produce anoxic condition that favor the formation of kinetically stable hydrocarbon . In this study , volatile organic substance ( VOS ) in peat bog were investigated using two technique : purge-and-trap and closed-loop stripping . Coupled gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy analysis revealed mainly branched hydrocarbon ( C8H18 ) in concentration up to 260 nM in peat pore-water . Additionally , alkylated benzene were found in concentration of up to 464 nM , in the peat pore-water , and up to 23 pptv in the headspace of peat core . However , one-third of all the compound in the complex VOS-fraction extracted from the peat system remain to be identified , especially those substance containing oxygen .

aVThis study examines the contribution of sunshine duration , snow cover extent , and the atmospheric circulation to variation of the cold-season diurnal temperature range ( DTR ) in eight region of the contiguous United States . The goal of the research is to facilitate the interpretation of long-term change in the DTR in light of the possible anthropogenic role in these trend . For the cold season ( Nov-Mar ) between 1958/59 and 1994/95 , daily surface observation at more than 200 station from the First Summary of the Day ( FSOD ) dataset a well a selected daily field from the NCEP-NCAR 40-Year Reanalysis Project are analyzed using compositing , correlation , and regression technique . For each region , a sea level pressure anomaly pattern is identified that is linearly related to daily variation in the DTR . It is found that the presence of positive sea level pressure anomaly over a region , clear sky , and the absence of snow on the ground all favor high value of the regionally averaged DTR . The strength of these association varies geographically because of the effect of nonlinear relationship , the frequency of snow cover , and the complexity of local dynamic . The cold-season trend of several variable for the period 1965/66-1994/95 are also analyzed . During the 30-yr period of record , the central and southern United States experienced a decrease in the DTR , while the northeast , Pacific coast , and portion of the interior west experienced an increase . Variations in the DTR-related sea level pressure pattern and sunshine duration explain significant fraction of the DTR increase in the coastal Northwest and the DTR decrease in the south-central state . The DTR trend over the rest of the country are largely unrelated to linear trend in sunshine duration , snow cover , or the sea level pressure field . The spatial pattern of DTR trend is reproduced when homogeneity-adjusted data from the Global Historical Climatology Network are used in lieu of FSOD data . Hence , it appears that the geographical pattern of trend is not a result of inhomogeneity in the FSOD data . The finding presented here suggest that many of the observed cold-season trend in the DTR are not induced by linearly related change in the atmospheric circulation and , therefore , are attributable either to internal nonlinear relationship in the climate system or to anthropogenic factor such a urbanization and increasing concentration of greenhouse gas and tropospheric aerosol .

aVHistorically , distribution of plant and animal have shifted with change in regional and global temperature . Current prediction from general circulation model show change in level and variation in temperature and rainfall over the next several decade . The magnitude and direction of such change vary regionally . Studies are beginning to show that these change will impact distribution of specie of plant and animals. , and , concomitantly , specie composition of plant and animal community . We used geographic information system , vegetation model . and general circulation model to predict the impact of global climate change ( GCC ) on the distribution of vegetation at a regional scale , the state of Texas . Then we used habitat preference for specie of rodent in the state to predict how GCC would impact their geographic range and specie richness . Our determination of suitable habitat for specie of rodent included an average of 98 % of capture point , and we found that suitable habitat averaged 62 % of the geographic range of specie . Size of habitat-corrected range increased an average of 2- to 3-fold under GCC , indicating that rodent were more adaptable to change in vegetation than were other mammal we studied ( e.g. , lagomorph and insectivore ) , whose range decreased , but similar to Chiroptera . whose range also increased . Geographic range shifted an average of 54 % under a warmer , wetter climate and 61 % under a warmer , drier climate , resulting in inclusion of an average of 60 % new vegetation association in the range under the former scenario and 64 % under the latter scenario . The impact of GCC on rodent in Texas wa greatest under the warmer , drier climatic scenario . Two specie , Oryzomys cousei and Microtus mexicanus , were predicted to go extinct because their suitable habitat did not occur under GCC . These result demonstrated that the type of climate change ( warmer , drier or warmer , wetter ) and it severity would be important . GCC wa predicted to have the greatest impact on rodent distribution in eastern Texas under a scenario of a warmer and wetter climate because forest expanded , whereas the impact would be greatest in western and southern Texas if climate becomes warmer and drier because desert and shrub habitat expanded . Life-history variable ( e.g. , habitat type or diet ) were correlated with change in size of range , location , or habitat composition , and reflected broad change in the relative distribution of vegetation type . Granivores and herbivore used fewer new habitat association that entered Texas after GCC than did omnivore or insectivore , a did terrestrial rodent compared with fossorial or arboreal rodent .

aVIn northwestern North America , glacier figure prominently in both indigenous oral tradition and narrative of geophysical science . These perspective intersect in discussion about global warming , predicted to be extreme at Arctic and Subarctic latitude and an area of concern for both local people and scientist . Indigenous people in northwestern North America have experienced climate variability associated with the latter phase of the Little Ice Age ( approximately 1550-1850 ) . This paper draw on oral tradition passed down from that period , some recorded between 1900 and the early 1950s in coastal Alaska Tlingit community and others recorded more recently with elder from Yukon First Nations . The narrative concern human travel to the Gulf of Alaska foreshore at the end of the Little Ice Age from the Copper River , from the Alaska panhandle , and from the upper Alsek-Tatshenshini drainage , a well a observation about glacier advance , retreat , and surge . The paper address two large policy debate . One concern the incorporation of local knowledge into scientific research . The second address the way in which oral tradition contributes another variety of historical understanding in area of the world where written document are relatively recent . Academic debate , whether in science or in history , too often evaluate local expertise a data or evidence , rather than a knowledge or theory that might contribute different perspective to academic question .

aVGlobal warming may affect the physiology , distribution , phenology and adaptation of plant and animal . In Israel , minimum summer temperature increased by an average of 0.26 degreesC per decade during the second half of the 20th century . Bergmann 's rule predicts that , in warm-blooded animal , race from warm region are smaller than race from cold region . Numerous study have reported general correlation between body mass in fossil animal and independently established palaeoclimatic change from various part of the world in accordance with this rule . Using museum specimen , I tested the prediction that the body mass and tarsus length of five resident passerine specie in Israel declined between 1950 and 1999 . The body mass of four specie ( the graceful warbler Prinia gracilis , the house sparrow Passer domesticus , the yellow-vented bulbul Pycnonotus xanthopygos and the Sardinian warbler Sylvia melanocephala , but not of the crested lark Galerida cristata ) declined significantly during this period . Tarsus length also declined significantly during this period for two specie ( the graceful warbler and the house sparrow ) . Body condition ( body mass-to-tarsus length ratio ) decreased in the Sardinian warbler , the yellow-vented bulbul and the crested lark . It is suggested that the above decline in body mass and tarsus length are due to global warming and also in accordance with Bergmann 's rule . The above explanation doe not exclude the possibility that other factor , such a a decrease in food availability , contributed to the decline in body mass . These decline may have serious implication for community structure and competition among bird specie and may affect the survival of small passerine .

aVLooks at the problem of global warming from the viewpoint of wholeness . That is , the problem of global warming will be looked at in a comprehensive study considering several aspect of the cosmos , the Earth , and the phenomenon of life . With such a broad understanding in mind , first analyzes both the disadvantageous and advantageous aspect of the current global warming . Second , compare three typical environmental condition in which human have lived . Third , employing the concept of global warming , look at the myth of how ancient civilization appeared and disappeared Then , considering our Earth system a an open system travelling in the universe , provides an explanation for the current global warming and for global climate change . It is expected that the explanation presented can be applied to produce long-term prediction for climate change .

aVThis paper deal with the risk of global warming a intensified by the carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) emission of the transport sector , particularly in gasoline-powered vehicle in Brazil . Car ownership and use are increasing rapidly partly because of very poor public transport quality , which , in turn , is causing higher emission level Of CO2 . In this connection , the use of ethanol in Brazil for the transport sector may prove to be an important alternative , furthering the effort to stabilise the actual level of gas in the atmosphere . The energy derived from biomass , and in this case , from a renewable , 'clean ' source , i.e. , from sugar-cane , ha the unquestionable advantage of permitting the almost complete reabsorption of CO2 emitted through the combustion of fuel alcohol . This closed cycle allows , in principle , the increase of the energy supply , essential for economic development , with fewer hazard to the environment .

aVA coupled physical-biogeochemical climate model that includes a dynamic global vegetation model and a representation of a coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model is driven by the nonintervention emission scenario recently developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) . Atmospheric CO2 , carbon sink , radiative forcing by greenhouse gas ( GHGs ) and aerosol , change in the field of surface-air temperature , precipitation , cloud cover , ocean thermal expansion , and vegetation structure are projected . Up to 2100 , atmospheric CO2 increase to 540 ppm for the lowest and to 960 ppm for the highest emission scenario analyzed . Sensitivity analysis suggest an uncertainty in these projection of -10 to +30 % for a given emission scenario . Radiative forcing is estimated to increase between 3 and 8 W m ( -2 ) between now and 2100 . Simulated warmer condition in North America and Eurasia affect ecosystem structure : boreal tree expand poleward in high latitude and are partly replaced by temperate tree and grass at lower latitude . The consequence for terrestrial carbon storage depend on the assumed sensitivity of climate to radiative forcing , the sensitivity of soil respiration to temperature , and the rate of increase in radiative forcing by both CO2 and other GHGs . In the most extreme case , the terrestrial biosphere becomes a source of carbon during the second half of the century . High GHG emission and high contribution of non-CO2 agent to radiative forcing favor a transient terrestrial carbon source by enhancing warning and the associated release of soil carbon .

aVThe radiative impact of greenhouse gas in warming the Earth varies significantly , depending on whether one considers the forcing at the tropopause or at the surface . Compared to the former , the surface forcing for some greenhouse gas is reduced by the interference of water vapour . Hence , we calculate alternative surface global warming potential ( SGWPs ) that are derived from the surface forcing radiation of greenhouse gas for potential use in surface radiative energy balance model ( SREBMs ) . For gas with a large water vapour overlap , the SGWPs are typically 30 % smaller than current GWPs ; for gas with relatively little overlap , the SGWPs arc larger by more than 33 % . These result may be used in conjunction with SREBMs a an additional mean of calculating climate change , and may lead to an altered emission budget compared to that outlined by the current Kyoto agreement .

aVThe emission of greenhouse gas ( GHG ) during feedlot manure composting reduces the agronomic value of the final compost and increase the greenhouse effect . A study wa conducted to determine whether GHG emission are affected by composting method . Feedlot cattle manure wa composted with two aeration methods-passive ( no turning ) and active ( turned six time ) . Carbon lost in the form of CO2 and CH4 wa 73.8 and 6.3 kg C Mg-1 manure for the passive aeration treatment and 168.0 and 8.1 kg C Mg-1 manure for the active treatment . The N loss in the form of N2O wa 0.11 and 0.19 kg N Mg-1 manure for the passive and active treatment . Fuel consumption to turn and maintain the windrow added a further 4.4 kg C Mg-1 manure for the active aeration treatment . Since CH4 and N2O are 21 and 310 time more harmful than CO2 in their global warming effect , the total GHG emission expressed a CO2-C equivalent wa 240.2 and 401.4 kg C Mg-1 manure for passive and active aeration . The Lower emission associated with the passive treatment wa mainly due to the incomplete decomposition of manure and a lower gas diffusion rate . In addition , turning affected N transformation and transport in the windrow profile , which contributed to higher N2O emission for the active aeration treatment . Gas diffusion is an important factor controlling GHG emission . Higher GHG concentration in compost windrows do not necessarily mean higher production or emission rate .

aVConcentrations of dissolved methane ( CH ( 4 ) ) , carbon dioxide ( CO ( 2 ) ) , and nitrous oxide ( N ( 2 ) O ) were measured in the water column of nonoxygenated and artificially oxygenated , ice-covered eutrophied lake in the mid-boreal zone in Finland during late winter 1997 and 1999 . Sampling wa conducted during winter stratification , the critical period for oxygen ( O ( 2 ) ) deficiency in seasonally ice-covered , thermally stratified lake . Oxygen concentration were maintained at least at a moderate level throughout the oxygenated water column , whereas the nonoxygenated column suffered anoxic hypolimnia . The mean concentration of dissolved CH ( 4 ) exceeding the atmospheric equilibrium were greater in the non-oxygenated water column ( 20.6-154 muM ) than in the oxygenated one ( 0.01-1.41 muM ) In contrast , the mean excess CO ( 2 ) concentration varied le between the non-oxygenated and oxygenated site ( 0.28-0.47 and 0.25-0.31 mM , respectively ) . Oxygenated water column had greater mean excess concentration of N ( 2 ) O ( 0.018-0.032 muM ) than the non-oxygenated one ( 0.005-0.024 muM ) . If the accumulated greenhouse gas store in the water column during winter are assumed to be released to the atmosphere during the spring overturn , the global warming potential ( GWP , time horizon 100 yr ) of these potential emission at the non-oxygenated , eutrophic study site ranged from 177 to 654 g CO ( 2 ) equivalent ( CO ( 2-e ) ) m ( -2 ) compared with 144 to 173 g CO ( 2-e ) m ( -2 ) at the oxygenated site . The increase in the accumulation of CHI wa the main reason for the higher GWP of the non-oxygenated site . Anthropogenic eutrophication of lake ecosystem can generate increased CHI emission due to associated O ( 2 ) depletion of their sediment and water column .

aVThe Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change ( IPCC ) ha concluded that the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) and tropospheric ozone ( O-3 ) are increasing concomitantly globally , , Little is known about the effect of these interacting gas on growth , survival , and productivity of forest ecosystem . In this study we ass the effect of three successive year of exposure to combination of elevated CO2 and O-3 on growth response in a five trembling aspen ( Populus tremuloides ) clonal mixture in a regenerating stand . The experiment is located in Rhinelander , Wisconsin , USA ( 45 degree N 89 degreesW ) and employ free air carbon dioxide and ozone enrichment ( FACE ) technology . The aspen stand wa exposed to a factorial combination of four treatment consisting of elevated CO2 ( 560 ppm ) , elevated O-3 ( episodic exposure-90 mul l ( -1 ) hour ( -1 ) ) , a combination of elevated CO2 and O-3 , and ambient control in 30 m treatment ring with three replication . Our overall result showed that our three growth parameter including height , diameter and volume were increased by elevated CO2 , decreased by elevated O-3 , and were not significantly different from the ambient control under elevated CO2 + O-3 . However , there were significant clonal difference in the response ; all five clone exhibited increased growth with elevated CO2 , one clone showed an increase with elevated O-3 , and two clone showed an increase over the control with elevated CO2 + O-3 , two clone showed a decrease , and one wa not significantly different from the control . Notably , there wa a significant increase in current terminal shoot dieback with elevated CO2 during the 1999-2000 dormant season . Dieback , wa especially prominent in two of the five clone , and wa attributed to those clone growing longer into the autumnal season where they were subject to frost . Our result show that elevated O-3 negates expected Positive growth effect of elevated CO2 in Populus tremuloides in the field , and suggest that future climate model prediction should take into account the offsetting effect of elevated O-3 on CO2 enrichment when estimating future growth of trembling aspen stand .

aVTo study the effect of global warming concomitant with rising CO2 on plant growth under field-like condition , a CO2-temperature gradient chamber ( CTGC ) wa created from a standard temperature gradient chamber ( TGC ) . Despite great daily and seasonal change in ambient air temperature , the gradient of air temperature wa simulated by 5 degreesC warmed condition at the air outlet , rising at a rare of 1 degreesC at 5 m interval . Also , CO2 concentration were linearly increased from the air inlet to the outlet ; those at the air inlet and 25 m distance from the air inlet were 372 p.p.m and 756 p.p.m . ( doubled ) , respectively . The CTGC proved successful in biological experiment conducted through a full growth season in 1998 . This apparatus will be useful for understanding plant response to simultaneous change in CO2 and temperature . Being a combination of a TGC and a CO2 gradient chamber , the improved CTGC allows parameter and validation data set to both be obtained for model contributing to plant growth , specie composition , and global carbon flux analysis .

aVThe mechanism involved in cloud formation affect the resulting cloud radiative property . Therefore , accurate cloud formation model and related global warming model require freezing data for ammonium sulfate particle , a major constituent of upper tropospheric cloud . Homogeneous ice nucleation in aqueous ammonium sulfate particle ha been studied by several laboratory group ; however , there is significant disagreement in the reported data . In the present work , the ice freezing temperature are measured by sending ( NH , ) , SO , particle , generated by vapor condensation , through a temperature-controlled flow cell , where ice formation is detected with infrared spectroscopy . To determine possible explanation for disparate result among several laboratory , the experimental method used in this study are closely examined . Experiments are performed to preclude artifact , and experimental condition are varied to develop a complete understanding of process involved in particle freezing . All experiment produce consistent result . Mass transfer calculation for the aerosol flow tube technique employed in the current study suggest that one frozen particle in 10 ( 4 ) to 10 ( 6 ) may scavenge sufficient water vapor from surrounding supercooled aqueous particle such that a single ice particle accumulates enough mass to yield a positive freezing event in the infrared spectrum . This result appears to partially explain the confusing and conflicting result coming from several laboratory employing different experimental method to observe homogeneous ice nucleation in ammonium sulfate . Six lower limit J ( cm ( -3 ) s ( -1 ) ) value are determined a 1.1 x 10 ( 6 ) ( 233 +/- 1 K , x = 0.013 +/- 0.001 ) , 1.1 x 10 ( 6 ) ( 231 +/- 1 K , x = 0.029 +/- 0.004 ) , 1.7 x 10 ( 6 ) ( 227 +/- 1 K , x = 0.066 +/- 0.015 ) , 2.8 x 10 ( 6 ) ( 226 +/- 1 K , x = 0.071 +/- 0.018 ) , 8.4 x 10 ( 6 ) ( 224 +/- 1 K , x = 0.097 +/- 0.034 ) , and 8.4 x 10 ( 8 ) ( 221 +/- 1 K , x = 0.153 +/- 0.076 ) , where the associated temperature and solute mole fraction aqueous composition ( x ) are noted in parenthesis .

aVWorld population will reach an estimated nine billion by 2050 . Given this factor and continued economic development in today 's low-income country , the total global demand for food will increase approximately threefold over the coming half-century . Meanwhile , against this background , newly-occurring global environmental change such a climate change are anticipated to affect food production . Other incipient large-scale environmental change likely to affect food production include stratospheric O-3 depletion , the accelerating loss of biodiversity ( with knock-on effect on crop and livestock pest specie ) and the perturbation of several of the great elemental cycle of N and S. The way in which these various environmental influence affect the production of food ( crop and livestock on land , and wild and cultivated fishery ) are complex and interactive . Uncertainties therefore persist about how global climate change is likely to affect world and regional food production . On balance , recent modelling-based estimate indicate that , in the medium to longer term , if not over the next several decade , climate change is likely to affect crop yield adversely , especially in food-insecure region . The prospect of increased climatic variability further increase the risk to future food production . Given these possible though uncertain adverse impact of climatic acid other environmental change on world food production , there is a need to apply the Precautionary Principle . There are finite , and increasingly evident , limit to agro-ecosystems and to wild fishery . Our capacity to maintain food supply for an increasingly large and increasingly expectant world population will depend on maximising the efficiency and sustainability of production method , incorporating socially-beneficial genetic biotechnology , and taking pre-emptive action to minimise detrimental ecologically-damaging global environmental change .

aVStudies of China 's energy development and carbon trading opportunity under CDM using aggregate approach often face two kind of difficulty : regional variation and economic and institutional constraint faced by decision maker at the sub-national level that are hard to model . This study initiate research that disaggregates the recent development of the Chinese electricity industry in a case study of Guangdong Province . We highlight a bifurcated development of efficient and inefficient generation technology in the past 10 year , and link it to the institutional arrangement for electricity supply , inadequate financial market and specific policy incentive . We also find , using Guangdong data , that carbon emission from the Guangdong electricity generation follows a declining trend from 0.29 million ton per TWh in 1990 to 0.24 in 1998 , with a planned level of 0.20 million ton in 2010 . An attempt to derive a shadow price of carbon by correlating heat rate with unit cost of generation show some problem in the cost data . In light of the CDM baseline discussion , our study suggests that credible and cost-effective baseline in Chinese power will demand disaggregation along vector of region and technology , and require an understanding of economic and institutional characteristic of energy decision making .

aVPhytometers of five C3 and five C4 specie were transplanted into three different grassland to study the effect of extreme climatic event on community invasibility and competition . Single extreme heating ( eight hour at 52.5 degreesC ) and rainfall ( the equivalent of 100 mm ) event in factorial combination were superimposed on the grassland community . A novel technique involving portable computer-controlled chamber wa used to create the heating event . In order to generate prediction of response to the extreme climatic event , the 10 phytometer specie were categorized con the basis of 12 key plant functional trait . Using principal component analysis , two functional type ( FTs ) were identified a most likely to be advantaged ( FT1 , fast-growing C4 annual ) and disadvantaged ( FT2 , slower-growing C3 perennial ) by an extreme climatic event . Competition between the resident vegetation and FT1 plus other C4 phytometers wa consistently more intense within the exclusively C3 community compared to the dry C3/C4 community or moist C3/C4 community . The single extreme heating event had the greatest impact on competition , lowering the intensity of competition between the phytometers and resident vegetation . Our result indicate that competition is highly important in limiting the invasion of C3 grassland by C4 specie . The FT1 and FT2 response confirmed prediction based on plant functional trait , whether growing a phytometers or a part of the resident vegetation . Future increase in climatic variability and the incidence of extreme climatic event are expected to suppress C3 competitive dominance and promote invasion of C4 specie , in particular , the FT1 specie .

aVThe high-arctic terrestrial environment is generally recognized a one of the world 's most sensitive area with regard to global warming . In this study , we examined the influence of an isolated warm period on net ecosystem carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) exchange at high latitude during autumn . Using the Free Air Temperature Increase ( FATI ) technique , we manipulated air , soil , and vegetation temperature in late August in a tundra site at Zackenberg in the National Park of North and East Greenland ( 74 degreesN 21 degreesW ) . The consequence for gross canopy photosynthesis , canopy respiration , and belowground respiration of increasing these temperature by approximately 2.5 degreesC were determined with closed dynamic CO2 exchange system . Under current temperature , the ecosystem acted a a net CO2 source , releasing 19 g CO2-C m ( -2 ) over the 14-day study period . Warm soil and senescing vegetation in autumn were unequivocally responsible for this efflux . Heating enhanced CO2 efflux to 29 g CO2-C m ( -2 ) . This effect wa attributed to a 39 % increase in belowground respiration , which wa the main component of the carbon ( C ) budget . Gross photosynthesis , on the other hand , wa not affected significantly by the simulated warming . Although the aftereffect of an isolated warm period on the C balance in early winter could be significant , simulation with a simple C budget model suggest that soil carbon pool are not affected to a great extent by such a climatic disturbance . The influence on atmospheric carbon , however , appears to be significant .

aVThis paper examines the implication of alternative approach to intertemporal social choice in a numerically calibrated model of interaction between global climate change and the world economy . Under cost-benefit analysis , relatively modest step towards greenhouse gas emission abatement are justified a economically efficient . Under classical utilitarianism and the precautionary principle . in contrast , aggressive step towards climate stabilization emerge a socially optimal . The paper review the value judgement that support each of these normative approach , arguing that the precautionary principle is most closely tied to the goal and objective of the Framework Convention on Climate Change .

aVSome of the effect of the global climate change comprise impact on human health , agricultural production and plague , sea level rise , pattern of precipitation and evaporation , and storm . The objective of this study is to ass the potential land loss upon a sea level rise of 0.5m in two Venezuelan coastal sector : Cabo Codera-Parque Nacional Laguna de Tacarigua and Barcelona-Puerto La-Cruz-Guanta . It wa estimated that the first one of the two sector is more vulnerable to land loss due to erosion , while loss due to inundation are not significantly higher for any of the two area . Impacts affect mostly urban area , tourist infrastructure and coastal wetland . In the vulnerability analysis of sea level impact , the response option evaluated would generate a very high cost for the country . It is proposed that vulnerability analysis to sea level rise be incorporated a part of the coastal zone planning and management process .

aVOceanic productivity , fishery yield and the net marine sequestration of atmospheric greenhouse gas are all controlled by the structure and function of planktonic community . Detailed paleoceanographic study have documented abrupt change in these process over timescales ranging from century to millennium . Most of these major shift in oceanic productivity and biodiversity are attributable to change in Earth 's climate , manifested through large-scale ocean-atmosphere interaction . By comparison , contemporary biodiversity and plankton community dynamic are generally considered to be `` static '' , in part due to the lack of a suitable time frame of reference , and the absence of oceanic data to document ecosystem change over relatively short timescales ( decade to century ) . Here we show that the average concentration of chlorophyll a ( chl a ) and the estimated rate of primary production in the surface water of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre ( NPSG ) off Hawaii have more than doubled while the concentration of dissolved silicate and phosphate have decreased during the past three decade . These change are accompanied by an increase in the concentration of chl b , suggesting a shift in phytoplankton community structure . We hypothesize that these observed ecosystem trend and other related biogeochemical process in the upper portion of the NPSG are manifestation of plankton community succession in response to climate variation . The hypothesized photosynthetic population `` domain shift '' toward an ecosystem dominated by prokaryote ha altered nutrient flux pathway and affected food web structure , new and export production process , and fishery yield . Further stratification of the surface ocean resulting from global warming could lead to even more enhanced selection pressure and additional change in biogeochemical dynamic .

aVUnderstanding the broad-scale ramification of accelerated sea level rise requires map of the land that could be inundated or eroded . Producing such map requires a combination of elevation information and model of shoreline erosion , wetland accretion , and other coastal process . Assessments of coastal area in the United States that combine all of these factor have focused on relatively small area , usually 25 to 30 km wide . In many case , the result are a sensitive to uncertainty regarding geological process a to the rate of sea level rise . This paper present map illustrating the elevation of land close to sea level . Although elevation contour do not necessarily coincide with future shoreline , the former is more transparent and le dependent on subjective modeling , Several method are available for inferring elevation given limited data , This paper us the US Geological Survey ( USGS ) 1degrees digital elevation series and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) shoreline data to illustrate the land below the 1.5 and 3.5 m contour for area the size of entire US state or larger , The map imply that approximately 58 000 km ( 2 ) of land along the Atlantic and Gulf coast lie below the 1.5 m contour . Louisiana , Florida , Texas , and North Carolina account fur more than 80 % of the low land , Outside of those 4 state , the largest vulnerable populated region is the land along the Eastern Shore of Chesapeake Bay stretching from Dorchester County , Maryland , to Accomac County , Virginia .

aVInfectious disease are still dramatically affecting public health in global dimension , in spite of the success of the 20th century medicine . Viruses represent the most serious threat for the future from the point of view of prevention a well a therapy , considering their ability to change rapidly their genetic information . Bacteria are also capable of mutation and acquisition of new genetic information from other bacteria , enabling them to generate new factor of virulence and to cause disease with new clinical symptom . Microorganisms acquire gene providing them with resistance to antimicrobial drug and disinfectant , a well a with possibility to create new antigen that affect both prevention and therapy , There is a reappearance of illness , such a diphtheria , which had been steadily receding in the second half of the last century . Changing lifestyle is another factor contributing to the increased spreading of infection . New diagnostic problem appear a the result of changing method of food production and dietary habit in industrialised country , accompanied with malnutrition in others , a well a of world-wide travel , contact with new pathogen , life in overcrowded city , industrial development , exploitation of natural resource , global warming and increasing number of immunocompromised people . Medical research discovered relation between well-known disease ( atherosclerosis , arthritis ) and infectious agent . This resulted in change in the approach to their prevention and treatment . Therefore , medicine in Slovakia need to update knowledge of the occurrence of new and re-emerging infectious disease both in Slovakia and abroad , and to organise their diagnostics in laboratory of clinical microbiology .

aVWe used a multilayered , backpropagation neural network to investigate the relative effect of yearly weather and long-term climate pattern on the abundance of northern bobwhite ( Colinus virginianus : hereafter , bobwhite ) in Oklahoma , USA . Bobwhite population have been declining for several decade across the United States , and predicted global climate change might accelerate the rate of decline . We were interested in whether bobwhite abundance wa more responsive to yearly precipitation and temperature , or to annual deviation from long-term mean climate pattern . We used roadside count data collected over a 6 year period ( 1991-1997 ) by the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation a a measure of bobwhite abundance . We standardized quail count among county by calculating the standard normal deviate for each county . Weather data were obtained from weather station closest to the roadside-count route . We had 280 training case and 68 test-validation case . Two data set were constructed : one using yearly weather data ( actual rainfall and temperature ) and the second using annual deviation from long-term mean value . We conducted simulation analysis to determine the nature of the relationship between each dependent variable and the standardized bobwhite count . A neural network with eight neuron wa most efficient for the yearly weather data , accounting for 25 % of the variation in the training data . The adjusted sum-of-squares for this model wa 2.42 . A four-neuron network wa selected for the deviation-from-normal data set , accounting for 23 % of the variation in the training data . The adjusted sum-of-squares for the deviation model wa 1.44 , indicating it performed better than the model for yearly weather pattern . Deviation from long-term mean July and August temperature combined contributed 31.5 % to the climate network 's prediction , and deviation from mean winter , spring , and summer precipitation combined contributed 42.8 % to the network 's prediction . As July temperature increased over the long-term mean , the number of bobwhite counted increased over the route mean , but the relationship decelerated at high July temperature . Predicted increase in bobwhite counted were highest when August temperature were below the mean and decreased rapidly for all temperature greater than the mean . Predicted bobwhite count increased asymptotically a winter rain increased over the long-term mean , but were greatest at mean spring-rainfall amount and at below average amount of summer rainfall . We conclude that the absolute change in yearly weather pattern predicted by some global change model will not have a great an impact on bobwhite abundance a will the magnitude of the deviation of these value from the climate bobwhite are adapted to in this portion of their range .

aVThe concentration of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere are rising at a rapid rate which the human race ha not experienced up to now . Methane is the important greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide is the gas now being paid most attention . Feeds ingested by herbivore include structural carbohydrate in the cell wall of plant . These polysaccharide are not digestible by digestive enzyme secreted from alimentary canal . However , many prokaryotic and enkaryotic bacteria synthesize enzyme complex capable of degrading them efficiently , In consequence , huge amount of acetate and hydrogen are produced by the oxidation of pyruvate . It ha been shown that hydrogen is a principal substrate for rumen methanogenesis by relating the rate of production of methane in rumen fluid . Thus , high digestibility of fibrous material may result in high methane emission from enteric fermentation . Intensive research effort have been directed towards the discovery of chemical agent which will modulate ruminal fermentation to improve feed efficiency . It is worth noting that overall the complex ecological system of the rumen work efficiently , particularly with aspect to cellulolysis . Therefore , our attempt to modify methane production should be selective and cause minimum disturbance to the rest of the rumen fermentation . In our effort to seek natural manipulator which have a suppressing effect on rumen methanogenesis , prophylactic effect of sulphur containing amino acid , some plant extract and probiotic on rumen methanogenesis have been studied in vitro and in vivo .

aVThree experiment starting from different initial condition have been made with the ECHAM-4 atmospheric General Circulation Model ( GCM ) integrated at T30 resolution forced with the observed sea-surface temperature ( SST ) over the period 1960-1994 . The tropical America mode of seasonal rainfall anomaly whose time variation is most accurately simulated by the GCM have been searched for using Singular Value Decomposition Analyses ( SVDA ) and Canonical Correlation Analysis ( CCA ) between observed and model field . The leading mode revealed by SVDA and CCA are highly similar , even though the ordering of the mode showed some fluctuation . A first skilful rainfall anomaly mode ha weight of the same sign almost everywhere in tropical America . except along the western coast and the sub-tropical margin . This mode appears in all of the four season assessed . A second major skilful mode is usually a bipolar north-south ( N-S ) rainfall anomaly pattern ( clear in December-March , DJFM : March-May , MAM , and June-September . JJAS ) . A large portion of the skill of the first rainfall anomaly mode ( same sign anomaly across tropical America except small patch along the western coast ) is through variance that is in common with the Southern Oscillation Index ( SOI ) . In addition to forcing from the central/eastern tropical Pacific SST . there also appears a contribution from contrasting SST anomaly in the tropical Atlantic . This rainfall mode is usually a regional portion of a more large-scale mode encompassing at least the whole tropical zone ( especially in DJFM , MAM and September-November . SON ) . Analysis of the relationship of this mode with GCM circulation feature reveals that a rainfall deficit ( respectively excedent ) over the main rainbelt of the tropical America region is associated with strengthening ( respectively weakening ) of the sub-tropical westerly jet stream , a global warming ( respectively cooling ) of the tropical atmosphere . an anomalous divergence ( respectively convergence ) in the lower level and an anomalous convergence ( respectively divergence ) in the upper level over tropical America and in the region of the Atlantic Inter-tropical Convergence Zone ( ITCZ ) . Such global feature are not so apparent for the dominant mode of JJAS . even though the correlation with El Nino-Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) indicator ( a SOI or NINO3 SST index ) are a high a for the other season . The bipolar N-S rainfall anomaly mode in tropical America is mostly related to anomalous N-S gradient of SST anomaly in the tropical Atlantic . The atmospheric circulation anomaly emphasize change in 850 hPa meridional wind in the tropical Atlantic . However , there is also interannual variance of this rainfall mode in both the model and observation that is unexplained by tropical Atlantic SSTs , but which is explained by central/eastern tropical Pacific SSTs and , potentially , SSTs from other tropical and extratropical area . This is especially true in MAM . Some difference in the detail of the model and observed teleconnection pattern are noted . Such difference can be used to statistically adjust the model simulation using the CCA or SVDA mode a basis pattern . Both statistical approach have been applied and the result are consistent between the two , The increase of skill is stronger when temporal correlation ( the pattern correlation ) between the model and observed pattern is high ( low ) a for JJAS . The skill is moderate to high around the whole Amazon basin . but remains relatively low inside the Amazon basin , though reliability of the observation themselves may influence this result . Averaged over all the season , about 15-35 % ( 35-55 % ) of the interannual grid-box ( regional ) seasonal rainfall variance is skilfully simulated from the observed SST forcing .

aVAim Recently discovered deep phylogenetic gap in coastal California marine taxon are geographically discordant with the provincial biogeographic boundary at Point Conception . This discordance run contrary to the phylogeographic hypothesis that were derived from study of coastal marine taxon in south-eastern North America . Here , I investigate the nature of the discrepant phylogeographic and biogeographic pattern in coastal California . Location Coastal south-western North America . Methods The scientific literature describing the phylogeography and biogeography of coastal California taxon wa reviewed . Data describing life-history characteristic , habitat , and degree of phylogeographic structure were extracted and compared . The geographical distribution of phylogenetic break wa compared with regional biogeographic data . Results All taxon were genetically variable . Those with greater dispersal ability generally had le phylogeographic structure . Although few taxon had very limited dispersal ability , many exhibited phylogeographic break within the California Transition Zone , a region of gradual specie replacement between Oregonian and Californian biogeographic province . The most precisely resolved phylogeographic break were geographically concordant with peak in the distribution of edge-effect specie , which are strong indicator of environmental discontinuity , or ecotones . Moreover , these phylogeographic gap , edge-effect specie , and ecotones coincide geographically with Late Pleistocene faunal discontinuity and probable long-term physical barrier to gene flow . Main conclusion Contrary to prior inference , phylogeographic pattern in coastal California marine taxon are consistent with the phylogeographic hypothesis . The concordance of phylogeographic . and biogeographic pattern in the coastal marine fauna of south-eastern and south-western North America , and also the Indo-Pacific , suggests that the phylogeographic hypothesis are generally applicable to many coastal marine setting . As such , they provide a framework for investigating and comparing pattern of evolution in disparate coastal marine fauna .

aVOver the past several decade annual surface air temperature ( SAT ) warming in western interior Canada ha been more than twice that of the global average . Inversions of the temperature profile in boreholes throughout this large region provide evidence of anomalously high ground surface temperature ( GST ) warming trend between the mid-19th century and present . Previous study have identified strong SAT/GST association throughout this region for the 20th century . This analysis of the composite , century-scale , regional GST history ( GSTHs ) is based on the deepest available borehole temperature log from the Foreland Sedimentary Basin in western and northern Canada , east of the Cordillera . Although separated by almost 20 degree latitude , there is strong regional correlation ( r = 0.98 ) between the GSTHs developed from northern ( boreal forest ) and southern ( prairie grassland ) boreholes . When filtered , the GSTHs of western Canada correlate strongly with the northern hemisphere ( r = 0.80 ) and the Canadian Arctic ( r = 0.86 ) high temporal resolution proxy climate history . Strong correlation also exists between the prairie grassland GSTH curve and the tree-ring-based surface summer temperature history from the Columbia Icefield in the Canadian Rocky Mountains close to Athabasca Glacier ( r = 0.95 ) . These finding strongly suggest that the similar , but enhanced , SAT warming signal identified by GSTHs make western interior Canada a strong indicator region of global warming .

aVA short sediment core from the deepest part of an alpine lake ( Lake Chuna , Kola Peninsula , northwestern Russia ) , covering about the past 200 yr of sediment accumulation , wa analysed for chironomid head capsule remains . The lake ha been receiving acidic precipitation and heavy metal loading from the atmosphere since the 1940 's . A total of 22 chironomid taxon were recorded . The most important taxon were typical element of oligotrophic lake , i.e . Micropsectra insignilobus , Paratanytarsus penicillatus , Stictochironomus spp . and Heterotrissocladius marcidus . Based on the cluster analysis result for the reconstructed environmental variable and chironomid community , three developmental stage were distinguished from the lake history : ( 1 ) Natural ontogeny stage ( before 1945 ) ; ( 2 ) Initial stage of anthropogenic ontogeny ( 1945-1982 ) ; and ( 3 ) Anthropogenic ontogeny stage ( 1982-1996 ) . During the first period , the change in the chironomid fauna were characterized a an anthropogenically undisturbed community , with M. insignilobus dominating ( 46-66 % ) . The change during the second period reflected the initial phase of anthropogenic succession associated with the beginning of acidification and heavy metal pollution . The main specie showed opposite distributional pattern in this period ; the abundance of the group M. insignilobus/Stictochironomus spp . decreased , whereas the abundance of P. penicillatus/H . marcidus increased . The third period wa characterized by a major shift in the faunal assemblage , from M. insignilobus to other dominant specie including P. penicillatus ( 19-30 % ) . The increase of Orthocladiinae relative abundance and total organic content in the uppermost sediment layer may be explained by a decrease in lake productivity . The decrease of cold-stenothermal taxon Stictochironomus spp . and M. insignilobus in the uppermost sediment layer can be explained by the global warming during the 20th century . The lake ecosystem is likely to be affected by both input of airborne contaminant and climate change .

aVOrdas plateau is a classical semi-dry sandland in China . The dry ecosystem responds sensitively to water-heat pattern of global change there . The distribution pattern and productivity of terrestrial ecosystem are greatly affected by global warming . Ecological adaptation strategy of seedling of Caragana intermedia Kuang et H. C. Fu , Hedysarum mongolicum Turcz . and Artemisia ordosica Kraschen. , three dominant shrub in Ordas plateau , were investigated in term of morphological plasticity , biomass effect and photosynthetic and physiological character , to the global warming by artificially controlling two temperature level . The result show that the effect of temperature enhancement on growth and photosynthetic and physiological character were obviously different among these three plant specie . Temperature enhancement significantly increased tree height , leaf number , leaf area , biomass , photosynthetic rate , transpiration rate and stomatal conductance of C. intermedia and H. mongolicum seedling , indicating that elevated temperature significantly affected the growth of these seedling positively . Elevated temperature had almost no significant effect on the growth of A. ordosica seedling . Their leaf number , leaf size , leaf area , biomass , transpiration rate and stomatal conductance did not increase obviously , but tree height and photosynthetic rate obviously increased with increasing temperature . Interspecific growth wa significantly different among C. intermedia , H. mongolicum and A. ordosica seedling . Except leaf size , value of the other seven character of C. intermedia seedling were greater than those of H. mongolicum and A. ordosica seedling .

aVA simple dynamic model relating forest area in a region , it contribution to dry season precipitation and the effect on it own establishment wa developed . The model equation show hysteresis between forest and savanna a a function of imported dry season precipitation . Regions are either dominated by forest or savanna , with each ecosystem showing stability despite change in imported dry season precipitation . Deforestation beyond a certain threshold value , however , could cause a collapse of forest ecosystem and replacement by savanna in marginal area . The prediction of this model corroborate pollen core analysis in the Amazon basin , where historical stability of tropical forest cover ha been shown despite global climate change .

aVThis paper focus on the role of accumulation and cloudiness change in the response of the Greenland ice sheet to global warming . Changes in accumulation or cloudiness were often neglected , or coupled to temperature change . We used model output on temperature , precipitation and cloudiness from a GCM ( ECHAM4 T106 ) . The GCM output wa used to drive the Greenland model that exists of a vertically averaged ice now model , coupled to a 1D surface energy balance model that calculates the ablation . Variables are temperature , accumulation and cloudiness . Sensitivity experiment with this model show that change in accumulation are very important for the ice sheet mass balance , whereas cloudiness is of secondary importance . If the Greenland model is forced by the GCM output , the Greenland model is found to contribute 70 % le to sea level rise after 70 year than is indicated by the result presented in the IPCC report . This large discrepancy is mainly due to the fact that the enhanced ablation is strongly compensated by increased accumulation . Comparing the result obtained here with change in mass balance derived directly from the same general circulation model , indicates a 20 % larger contribution to sea level . This increase is due to change in ice now , and a different method for the ablation calculation .

aVUsing standard statistical and thermodynamic procedure , we calculate equilibrium constant for the formation of select , hydrogen-bonded water complex , namely the water dimer and the cyclic trimer and tetramer , and use them to estimate the atmospheric abundance of these specie . We generate water complex altitude profile ( 0-30 km ) for both a saturated and an unsaturated atmosphere and discus the dominant factor influencing our result . In our analysis , particular emphasis is given to the significance that water monomer concentration , complex binding energy , hydrogen-bond energy , and entropy have on the calculated abundance profile . We examine the importance of enthalpy and entropy at atmospheric temperature and show how each contributes to our calculated equilibrium constant . By applying a universal 2 degreesC temperature increase throughout the troposphere and lower stratosphere , we are able to model the effect that global warming would have on ( H2O ) ( n ) abundance in a saturated atmosphere . We also illustrate the effect that this thermal variation would have on entropy , enthalpy , and K-p ( T ) value . Based on our result , we ass the atmospheric significance of water dimer and cyclic water complex . ( C ) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All right reserved .

aVClimate change will likely result in warmer winter temperature leading to le snowfall in temperate forest . These change may lead to increase in soil freezing because of lack of an insulating snow cover and change in soil water dynamic during the important snowmelt period . In this study , we manipulated snow depth by removing snow for two winter , simulating the late development of the snowpack a may occur with global warming , to explore the relationship between snow depth , soil freezing , soil moisture , and infiltration . We established four site , each with two paired plot , at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest ( HBEF ) in New Hampshire , U.S.A. and instrumented all eight plot with soil and snow thermistor , frost tube , soil moisture probe , and soil lysimeters . For two winter , we removed snow from the designated treatment plot until February . Snow in the reference plot wa undisturbed . The treatment winter ( 1997/1998 and 1998/1999 ) were relatively mild , with temperature above the seasonal norm and snow depth below average . Results show the treated plot accumulated significantly le snow and had more extensive soil frost than reference plot . Snow depth wa a strong regulator of soil temperature and frost depth at all site . Soil moisture measured by time domain reflectometry probe and leaching volume collected in lysimeters were lower in the treatment plot in March and April compared to the rest of the year . The ratio of leachate volume collected in the treatment plot to that in the reference plot decreased a the snow ablation season progressed . Our data show that even mild winter with low snowfall , simulated by snow removal , will result in increased soil freezing in the forest at the HBEF . Our result suggest that a climate shift toward le snowfall or a shorter duration of snow on the ground will produce increase in soil freezing in northern hardwood forest . Increases in soil freezing will have implication for change in soil biogeochemical process .

aVA global warming , primarily affecting wintertime condition at high latitude will influence the functioning of the boreal forest . The least known term of the winter water-balance equation is evaporation of snow intercepted in forest canopy . Several investigation stress the importance of snow-interception evaporation in coniferous forest and evaporation fraction of gross precipitation a large a 0.2-0.5 have been observed by investigator in Scotland , Canada , and Japan . Evaporation rate a high a 0.56 mm h ( -1 ) are reported . The largest difference between the rain and snow interception evaporation process are the difference in Storage . Snow storage ( both mass and duration ) is often an order of magnitude larger than that for rain . Snow interception change the canopy albedo although some study indicate the opposite . Process knowledge is limited because of measurement difficulty but it is known that canopy closure , aerodynamic resistance ( r ( a ) ) , and vapour-pressure deficit are important factor . Existing formulation of r ( a ) a function of storage location and age can not fully explain observed difference in evaporation rate . Operational hydrology and weather model , and GCMs describe snow interception in a very simplified way and might benefit from incorporation of more realistic scheme .

aVThis paper is focused on Albian Spiroplectinata , a morphologically unique , benthic , agglutinated foraminifer genus , and it application for reconstructing change in the water mass within the Lower Saxony Basin . A new interpretation of microhabitat preference and feeding habit for Spiroplectinata is proposed and discussed . Their functional morphology , composition of their test , and their relationship with adherent foraminifera suggest that at least adult individual of Spiroplectinata were epibenthic and were either suspension or deposit feeder . The suspension-feeding mode is favoured because this genus is associated with adherent suspension-feeding foraminifera and it doe not correlate with other epibenthic deposit feeder . Spiroplectinata constructed an elongated uniserial terminal part , which probably facilitated an erect position to spread a reticulopodium well above the sediment/water interface . The distribution of this foraminifer can , therefore , be used here a a sensitive indicator for the existence of bottom current . Four ( or five ) period of intensified bottom water circulation around the Early/Middle Albian boundary ( S-1 ) , Middle ( S-2 ) , late Middle to earliest Late Albian ( S-3 , probably represents two interval ) and early Late Albian ( S-4 ) are reconstructed and well marked by maximum of Spiroplectinata annectens , S. complanata , and Spiroplectinata sp . A. S. annectens is known from stratum in the Western Tethys ( i.e . in the Late Aptian and Early Albian ) that are older than those in the 'Boreal ' realm . Its first appearance in the Lower Saxony Basin occurs in the late Early Albian , followed by the first maximum just above the Early/Middle Albian boundary , and probably represents the main immigration event into the Lower Saxony Basin . This support the idea that the deep water in the late Early to early Late Albian 'Boreal ' epicontinental sea during 'the Spiroplectinata interval ' came from the Tethys and not from the polar region . If one interprets the plankton/benthos foraminifera ratio a reflecting sea-level change , it implies that sea-level rise may have been responsible for opening and/or deepening of 'Boreal'/Tethyan gateway that activated extensive exchange of water mass . This late Early Albian and early Late Albian 'invasion ' of Tethyan water can be correlated with a general global warming , and shifting of climate zone . ( C ) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

aVA multi-tiered forecast procedure is employed to simulate real-time operational seasonal forecast of categorized ( below-normal , near-normal and above-normal ) streamflow at the inlet of twelve dam of the Vaal and upper Tugela river catchment in South Africa . Forecasts are made for the December to February ( DJF ) season over an 8-year independent period from 1987/ 1988 to 1994/1995 . A physically based model of the atmosphere system , known a a general circulation model ( GCM ) , is used to simulate atmospheric variability over southern Africa , the output of which is statistically downscaled to streamflow . The GCM used is the COLA T30 , and is forced at the boundary with predicted monthly-mean global sea-surface temperature . The monthly-mean sea-surface temperature field are first predicted over lead-times of several month using a canonical correlation analysis ( CCA ) model . GCM simulation are then obtained for an area including most of southern Africa and adjacent ocean . The GCM simulation are downscaled to catchment level from coarse resolution gridded climate variable , using a perfect prognosis approach : bias-corrected GCM simulation are substituted into the perfect prognosis equation to provide the downscaled categorized streamflow forecast . Although surface characteristic of each catchment that affect the variability of streamflow are not considered in the proposed downscaling system , successful forecast of streamflow category were obtained for some of the year forecast independently . The scheme 's operational utility is thus demonstrated . albeit over short lead-times . ( C ) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All right reserved .

aVAerosols affect the Earth 's temperature and climate by altering the radiative property of the atmosphere . A large positive component of this radiative forcing from aerosol is due to black carbon-soot-that is released from the burning of fossil fuel and biomass , and , to a lesser extent , natural fire , but the exact forcing is affected by how black carbon is mixed with other aerosol constituent . From study of aerosol radiative forcing , it is known that black carbon can exist in one of several possible mixing state ; distinct from other aerosol particle ( externally mixed ( 1-7 ) ) or incorporated within them ( internally mixed ( 1,3,7 ) ) , or a black-carbon core could be surrounded by a well mixed shell 7 . But so far it ha been assumed that aerosol exist predominantly a an external mixture . Here I simulate the evolution of the chemical composition of aerosol , finding that the mixing state and direct forcing of the black-carbon component approach those of an internal mixture , largely due to coagulation and growth of aerosol particle . This finding implies a higher positive forcing from black carbon than previously thought , suggesting that the warming effect from black carbon may nearly balance the net cooling effect of other anthropogenic aerosol constituent . The magnitude of the direct radiative forcing from black carbon itself exceeds that due to CH4 , suggesting that black carbon may be the second most important component of global warming after CO2 in term of direct forcing .

aVIn order to assist in finding way to mitigate CO2 emission and to slow the depletion of fossil fuel we have established and evaluated a representative system , which consists of three technology developed in our laboratory . These technology were in CO2 recovery , hydrogen production and methanol synthesis and in addition we established the necessary supporting system . Analysis of outline design of the large scale renewable energy power generation system and this system and energy input for building plant , energy input for running plant ha been conducted based on a case using this system for a 1000-MW coal fired power plant , followed by an evaluation of the material balance and energy balance . The result are a follows . Energy efficiency is 34 % , the CO2 reduction rate is 41 % , the balance ratio of the energy and CO2 of the system is 2.2 and 1.8 , respectively , on the assumption that the primary renewable energy is solar thermal power generation , the stationary CO2 emission source is a coal-fired power plant and the generation efficiency of the methanol power plant is 60 % . By adopting the system , 3.7 million ton of CO2 can be recovered , approximately 2.7 million ton of methanol can be produced , and 15.4 billion kWh of electricity can be generated per year . Compared to generating all electrical power using only coal , approximately 2.6 million ton of coal per year can be saved and approximately 2.15 million ton of CO2 emission can be reduced . Therefore , it is clearly revealed that this system would be effective to reduce CO2 emission and to utilize renewable energy . ( C ) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All right reserved .

aVWithin the framework of the European LAPP-project ( Land Arctic Physical Processes ) and a part of the Danish Research Council 's Polar Programme , study on water and surface energy balance in NE Greenland were conducted in 1996 and 1997 . Eddy correlation measurement of water vapour and sensible heat flux above the three dominant vegetation type : fen , willow snowbed , and heath were conducted for the entire growing season . This wa supplemented by measurement of evaporation from snow covered area and from a small pond . The evapotranspiration wa found to be relatively high with the maximum from the fen ( approximate to 86 per season ) . For the two other vegetation type the evapotranspiration wa le , for heath 61 mm per season , while willow snowbed had evaporation rate on intermediate level . By use of the Penman-Monteith equation it wa possible to estimate the altitude dependence of the evapotranspiration and calculate the annual evaporation for the whole area to 80 mm per year . By applying a bucket model the evaporation wa found to be in accordance with change in soil moisture a monitored with TDR . The observed surface water balance wa compared to river discharge , which show a glacio-nival regime with an early spring flow ( June ) , determined by the snow melt in the main valley and an July-August maximum determined by melt on higher plateau area . When balancing the individual hydrological component an annual deficit of 180 mm wa observed , but it wa found that this deficit could be reduced by correcting for aerodynamic and altitude effect on the precipitation . Finally some of the possible consequence of a global warming is discussed in relation to the water and energy balance in the high-arctic ecosystem .

aVSurvival and development of larva of Aedes aegypti ( L. ) and Aedes albopictus ( Skuse ) were examined under field condition on the campus of Nagasaki University School of Medicine , Nagasaki , Japan , to explore the possibility of the establishment of Ae . aegypti in Kyusyu , southern Japan , Exposure experiment with hatched larva were conducted 11 time at about 1-mo interval from January 1998 to January 1999 . In both specie , larva could develop to adult under field condition from April to November , but not in January , February , and December 1998 . In March 1998 , only Ae . albopictus could develop to adult . The result suggest that there are difference in the resistance of hatched larva to low temperature between Ae . aegypti and Ae . albopictus and a threshold air temperature of larval development below 10 degreesC for both specie . To estimate the threshold temperature of larval development , the relationship between the average air temperature and the developmental rate observed in March-November 1998 were analyzed by linear regression analysis . The estimated threshold air temperature for Ae . aegypti were 8.52 and 9.45 degreesC for female and male , respectively , and were higher than those of Ae . albopictus . A clear seasonal change wa also observed in the body size of pupa . In both specie , body size wa largest at the beginning of the breeding season and continuously became gradually smaller until July . The result were compared with those from previous field study in Nagasaki and the possibility of the establishment of Ae . aegypti in Nagasaki , Japan , is discussed from the viewpoint of adaptive life history to seasonally changing environment .

aVWe investigated how constant temperature of 22 , 24 , and 26 degreesC experienced across the full life cycle affected the dynamic of caged population of Aedes albopictus ( Skuse ) . All cage were equipped with plastic beaker that served a site for oviposition and larval development . We measured the per caput daily mortality and emergence rate of the adult and size of adult female , and estimated the intrinsic rate of increase ( r ) and asymptotic density ( K ) for each adult population . population at 26 degreesC had greater intrinsic rate of increase and lower asymptotic density than population at 22 and 24 degreesC . Populations at high temperature initially had greater daily . per caput emergence rate , and steeper . decline in per caput emergence rate a density increased over tire course of the experiment , There wa no temperature effect on the size of adult female nor on the per caput daily mortality rate of adult . Results indicated that population of Ae . albopictus occurring in region with relatively high summer temperature are likely to have hiyh rate of population growth with population of adult peaking early in the season . These population mn ) l attain relatively . low peak density of adult . Populations occurring in region with low summer temperature are likely to experience slow , steady production of adult throughout the season with population size peaking later in the season , and may attain higher peal , density of adult . Nigh temperature condition , associated with climate change , may increase the rate of spread of Ae , albopictus by increasing rate of increase and by . enhancing colonization due to rapid population growth .

aVLarge reservoir of natural gas hydrate have been sampled extensively by past DSDP , ODP , and other scientific ocean drilling . Gas hydrate is an ice-like solid consisting of gas molecule , commonly methane , trapped in a cage of water molecule . Global estimate of the methane content of natural gas hydrate are very large , potentially enormous . Such large quantity of gas hydrate could be important a a clean energy source , a a control in global climate , and a a factor in seafloor slump and slide . Gas hydrate occurs only in water depth greater than about 600 m at temperate latitude , but occurs on land and in shallow water in the Arctic . The formation mechanism of gas hydrate are only partly understood . Gas hydrate appears to be formed usually by migrating fluid carrying biologically generated methane upward to region of sufficiently low temperature and high pressure where the hydrate is stable . Quantitative aspect of this formation model need testing , however , and question remain about the source and sink for methane , and the amount that can reach the atmosphere . In Canada , gas hydrate are found on most of it continental margin , notably on the continental slope off Vancouver Island and in the Mackenzie Delta-Beaufort Sea region . A drilling program off Vancouver Island would examine gas hydrate in a well-studied accretionary sedimentary wedge ; such sediment appear to be the most common environment in which hydrate are found globally . Drilling for gas hydrate offshore in the Canadian Arctic , perhaps using an alternative drilling platform , would complement a current onshore Arctic gas hydrate drilling program in the permafrost environment . The Arctic land and shallow sea hydrate are important because such hydrate is especially susceptible to global climate change .

aVThe average mass concentration of the aerosol in Beijing during the dust storm in the spring of 2000 wa similar to 6000 mug . m ( -3 , ) similar to 30 time a high a that in the non-dust storm day . The enrichment factor of the pollution element As , W and Se were higher than those in the non-dust storm day . This indicated that As , Sb and Se resulted from the pollution source of those area , through which the dust storm passed during their long-range transport , in addition to the local pollution source in Beijing , The enrichment factor of the Pb , Zn , Cd and Cu were much le than those in the cion-dust storm day , suggesting that the local pollution source in Beijing area contributed to them mostly , The enrichment factor of element Al , Fe , Sc , Mn , Na , Ni , Cr , V and Co were close to 1 , showing that these element originated from crust , The concentration of S in the dust storm wa similar to 10 mug . m ( -3 ) , 4 time a high a that in non-dust storm . S in the aerosol resulted from the adsorption of gaseous SO2 and the consequent transformation on it . The aerosol of the dust storm contained 16.1 % and 76.9 % of fine particle with the size le than 2.1 and 9.0 mum , respectively , while it had a large number of coarse particle , It wa noted that a considerable portion of Fe ( II ) wa detected from the dust storm . Fe ( II ) could easily dissolve in seawater to be nutrient for phytoplankton and would lead to the increase of the emission of dimethylsulfide ( DMS ) from the ocean . The feedback of Fe coupled with S in atmosphere might be the important mechanism that would affect the primary productivity in Pacific and/or the global climate change .

aVCurrent evidence suggests research in veterinary parasitology is in decline despite it importance . This is particularly true in the UK where research fund have been diverted into BSE . Decline in interest in veterinary parasitology is at least in part due to the success of major pharmaceutical company in producing a range of effective and safe anti-parasitic drug . Research is needed because of the effect of parasite on animal welfare and the economic cost of parasite . However , there is little information on the actual cost of animal parasite . Another major reason for research is the development of drug resistance in protozoa , helminth and arthropod of veterinary importance . This is a serious problem particularly for sheep and goat in the southern hemisphere . A prioritised list of research requirement is suggested : ( i ) new drug ; ( ii ) resistance management ; ( iii ) vaccine ; ( iv ) breeding for resistance ; ( v ) improved diagnostics ; ( vi ) zoonosis ; ( vii ) global warming and parasite . There is a major political challenge to raise the profile of veterinary parasitology and thus the funding essential for it advancement and the continued welfare and productivity of animal .

aVThe objective of this paper is to emphasize the responsibility of developed country to implement the Climate Convention , a well a the role of developing country in CO2 emission control while sustaining their right to increase energy consumption per caput during the development process . It is shown that the growth in CO2 emission from fossil fuel consumption in North America , excluding Mexico , from 1990 to 1996 wa 3.7 time higher than that of Latin America in absolute term . The cumulative contribution to global warming , expressed a the mass of the gas multiplied by time ( GtCy ) , can be calculated a the integration of the atmospheric concentration of the emitted gas along time , with a weight function in the integrand to simulate the climate response . To simulate climate response , we used the superposition of exponential decay function with different decay constant . The historical contribution of the OECD country , the Eastern European country and the ex-Soviet Union , and from all developing country are considered . The future contribution are computed in three scenario . All of them show that emission from Non-Annex I country will become higher than those of Annex I country soon after 2010 , while the curve of atmospheric concentration will cross one another later , not much before 2050 , and the respective contribution to global temperature increase will cross about 2090 .

aVKnowledge of upper thermal-tolerance limit of marine organism in the tropical eastern Pacific ( TEP ) is important because of the influence of phenomenon such a El Nino and global warming , which increase sea temperature . Laboratory experiment were conducted to determine the critical thermal maximum ( CTM ) of reef fish from the TEP . In 15 reef fish of Gorgona Island ( TEP ) the CTM wa between 34.7 degreesC and 40.8 degreesC . None of these CTMs wa exceeded by sea temperature in the TEP during any of the strongest El Nino event in this century ( 32 degreesC during El Nino 1982-1983 and 1997-1998 ) . which indicates that all specie studied here may tolerate El Nino maximum temperature . In addition , the CTM of the least-tolerant specie wa 8 degreesC above the current mean sea temperature in a wide range of latitude in the TER This suggests that fish live far from their upper thermal tolerance limit and that the current global-warming trend is still unlikely to be dangerous for these specie . If sea temperature continues to increase at the current rate , in about a century sea temperature could exceed the thermal tolerance of some reef fish and threaten them with extinction . Such risk . however , might occur sooner if the sea temperature during El Nino also increased in step with the global warming , but also because other process involved in maintaining population , such a reproduction , can be affected at lower temperature . The possible ability , of reef fish to adapt to increase in sea temperature is discussed .

aVThe global three-dimensional Lagrangian chemistry-transport model STOCHEM ha been used to follow the change in the tropospheric distribution of the two major radiatively-active trace gas , methane and tropospheric ozone , following the emission of pulse of the short-lived tropospheric ozone precursor specie , methane , carbon monoxide , NO ( x ) and hydrogen . The radiative impact of NO ( x ) emission were dependent on the location chosen for the emission pulse , whether at the surface or in the upper troposphere or whether in the northern or southern hemisphere . Global warming potential were derived for each of the short-lived tropospheric ozone precursor specie by integrating the methane and tropospheric ozone response over a 100 year time horizon . Indirect radiative forcing due to methane and tropospheric ozone change appear to be significant for all of the tropospheric ozone precursor specie studied . Whereas the radiative forcing from methane change is likely to be dominated by methane emission , that from tropospheric ozone change is controlled by all the tropospheric ozone precursor gas , particularly NO ( x ) emission . The indirect radiative forcing impact of tropospheric ozone change may be large enough such that ozone precursor should be considered in the basket of trace gas through which policy-makers aim to combat global climate change .

aVWater vapor is the most radiatively active greenhouse gas , and the process of water-vapor feedback may significantly ; amplify global warming induced by anthropogenic greenhouse gas . Satellite radiance observation from the past 20 year , which are sensitive to the mater vapor and temperature of the upper troposphere , provide the first global observation of trend in upper-tropospheric humidity . These decadal trend are strongly positive in the deep tropic , negative in the Southern Hemisphere subtropics and midlatitudes , and of mixed sign in the Northern Hemisphere subtropics and midlatitudes . The trend are shown to be consistent with atmospheric circulation change observed in the past 20 year , including a tendency toward more EI Nino-Southern Oscillation warm event and change in transient eddy activity in the subtropics .

aVThe Paleocene/Eocene thermal maximum ( PETM ) wa a time of rapid global warming in both marine and continental realm that ha been attributed to a massive methane ( CH4 ) release from marine gas hydrate reservoir . Previously proposed mechanism for this methane release rely on a change in deepwater source region ( s ) to increase water temperature rapidly enough to trigger the massive thermal dissociation of gas hydrate reservoir beneath the seafloor . To establish constraint on thermal dissociation , we model heat flow through the sediment column and show the effect of the temperature change on the gas hydrate stability zone through time . In addition , we provide seismic evidence tied to borehole data for methane release along portion of the U.S. continental slope ; the release site are proximal to a buried Mesozoic reef front . Our model result , release site location , published isotopic record , and ocean circulation model neither confirm nor refute thermal dissociation a the trigger for the PETM methane release . In the absence of definitive evidence to confirm thermal dissociation , we investigate an alternative hypothesis in which continental slope failure resulted in a catastrophic methane release . Seismic and isotopic evidence indicates that Antarctic source deepwater circulation and seafloor erosion caused slope retreat along the western margin of the North Atlantic in the late Paleocene . Continued erosion or seismic activity along the oversteepened continental margin may have allowed methane to escape from gas reservoir trapped between the frozen hydrate-bearing sediment and the underlying buried Mesozoic reef front , precipitating the Paleocene/Eocene boundary methane release . An important implication of this scenario is that the methane release caused ( rather than resulted from ) the transient temperature increase of the PETM . Neither thermal dissociation nor mechanical disruption of sediment can be identified unequivocally a the triggering mechanism for methane release with existing data . Further documentation with high-resolution benthic foraminiferal isotopic record and with seismic profile tied to borehole data is needed to clarify whether erosion , thermal dissociation , or a combination of these two wa the triggering mechanism for the PETM methane

aVPollen and spore flora from the Bear Creek section in western Alabama ( US Gulf Coast ) record vegetation event from the lower to middle Tuscahoma Formation ( late Palaeocene mid NP9 ) . Sporomorphs are abundant and well preserved in these sediment and are used a a proxy to record vegetation change over time . We present result from both palynofloral and clay mineral analysis in the interval approximately 0.4-0.1 my before the Paleocene/Eocene thermal maximum ( PETM ) ; a period of transient and intense global warming that had a profound effect on animal and plant group in high latitude . An important factor that ha a significant bearing on our understanding of turnover across the PETM is that of climate/environmental stability prior to the PETM in terrestrial ecosystem . Palynological analysis with a between sample resolution of 30 % abundance throughout the studied section and provides some evidence that the Apectodinium acme is not correlative with the PETM at middle latitude .

aVCulicoides imicola , a vector of bluetongue virus and African horse sickness virus , is principally Afro-Asian in distribution , but ha recently been found in part of Europe . A logistic regression model based on climate data ( temperature , saturation deficit , rainfall and altitude ) and the published distribution of C. imicola in Iberia wa developed and then applied to other country in Europe , to identify location where C. imicola could become established . The model identified three temperature variable a significant determinant of the distribution of C. imicola in Iberia ( minimum of the monthly minimum temperature , maximum of the monthly maximum temperature and number of month per year with a mean temperature greater than or equal to 12.5 degreesC ) . The model indicated that under current condition , the distribution of C. imicola in Spain , Greece and Italy could be extended and the vector could potentially invade part of Albania , Yugoslavia , Bosnia and Croatia . To simulate the effect of global warming , temperature value in the model were increased by 2 degreesC . Under these condition , the potential spread of C. imicola in Europe would be even more extensive .

aV[ 1 ] Differences in time-variation between total and ultraviolet solar irradiance could help in separating their influence on climate . We present the first model based on area measurement of magnetic plage from CaK spectroheliograms obtained between 1915-1999 . Correlation of our time series of UV irradiance with global temperature , T , account for only 20 % of the global temperature variance during the 20th century . Correlation of our total irradiance time series with T account statistically for 80 % of the variance in global temperature over that period , although the irradiance variation amplitude is insufficient to influence global warming in present-day climate model . This interesting difference ha been obscured in past modelling by additional component introduced to represent secular variation , which are no longer supported by current observational evidence . Future irradiance model emphasizing the more securely-based contribution of photospheric magnetic structure seem to provide better prospect for improved physical understanding of sun-climate link .

aVWe here present an inventory of rodent from Niger , mainly based on cytotaxonomic data because of the presence of many group providing sibling specie . A total of 39 specie are listed , one of which is a new chromosomal form ( Taterillus sp. ) . Moreover , three other cytotypes already described but still not specifically attributed were found ( Mastomys sp. , Acomys sp . and Tatera sp ) . New karyotypic data are presented for Gerbillus nancillus , Graphiurus cf . parvus , Massouteria mzabi , and Xerus erythropus . Once again , the efficiency of cytotaxonomy for small mammal inventory is enhanced . Specific distribution map of poorly known specie are thus completed . No clear gradient could be observed between what is currently defined a the West and the East African fauna . The distribution are mainly structured in a latitudinal manner . The Air massif appears a a continuous prolongation of the Sahelian area , rather than a a Sahelian refuge in the Sahara . Five biogeographical group of specie were distinguished : 1 ) a Sudanian group in the area receiving le than 700 turn rainfall , 2 ) a group of very widespread specie largely overlapping the Sudanian ( more than 700 turn rainfall ) and the Sahelian area , and sometimes including some Saharan locality , 3 ) a typical Saharan group , 4 ) some specie infeoded to the mountainous Saharan area , and 5 ) few strictly commensal specie . A global southward extension of several taxon confirms the desertification of the Sahel , a a result of both natural global warming and human activity .

aVScientific evidence indicates that a global climate change due to human activity is possible within a century . It is expected that doubling Of CO2 and increasing the amount of other greenhouse gas in the atmosphere would result in more severe weather , among other consequence . The purpose of the paper is to examine how flood frequency and magnitude in a midsize subalpine watershed on the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains in Alberta , Canada , would change under 2 X CO2 condition . Given the poor spatial resolution of present general circulation model ( GCM ) and their uncertain performance at the regional scale , a first-order analysis is carried on , in which only rainfall intensity change are considered to have the most significant impact on future flood . Estimates of storm rainfall increase are based on the literature survey , GCM projection for the study area , and transposition of southern climatic condition . Two scenario of likely most severe change were selected : first , a 25 % increase in the mean and standard deviation of Gumbel distribution of rainfall depth for storm duration from 6 to 48 h ; second , a 50 % increase in the standard deviation only . The HEC-1 watershed model and the soil conservation service runoff curve method for abstraction were used in Monte Carlo simulation . Comparison of Monte Carlo derived flood frequency curve for the two scenario with the present day curve show that scenario I is more critical in term of flood flow increase than scenario 2 . Under scenario 1 , the mean annual flood on the study watershed would increase by almost 80 % and the 100-year flood would increase by 41 % . ( C ) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All right reserved .

aVModels of complex system can capture much useful information but can be difficult to apply to real-world decision-making because the type of information they contain is often inconsistent with that required for traditional decision analysis . New approach , which use inductive reasoning over large ensemble of computational experiment , now make possible systematic comparison of alternative policy option using model of complex system . This article describes Computer-Assisted Reasoning , an approach to decision-making under condition of deep uncertainty that is ideally suited to applying complex system to policy analysis . The article demonstrates the approach on the policy problem of global climate change , with a particular focus on the role of technology policy in a robust , adaptive strategy for greenhouse gas abatement .

aVOver the year 1990-99 , a colour-banded population of Blue-breasted Fairy-wrens , Malurus pulcherrimus , wa studied at Dryandra State Forest in Eucalyptus wandoo woodland . Much of this work coincided with a study ( by other worker ) of the same specie in patch of heathland scattered through wheatland at Wyalkatchem ( 1993-98 ) . At Dryandra , group of 2-4 adult lived all year round in territory averaging 2.5 ha ; clutch size wa two or three egg ( mean 2.8 ) , with more two-egg clutch laid in dry year , a at Wyalkatchem . The main difference between the two study wa in the timing of breeding . At Wyalkatchem the first clutch were laid in early August , whereas in Dryandra August is still cold , and no egg were laid before mid-September . In wetter year laying ceased at Wyalkatchem towards the end of December but at Dryandra it continued into February . Individual nest success wa low at both site , but with a longer nesting season Dryandra group renested more frequently and produced more fledgling ( 1.63 fledgling per group at Wyalkatchem , 1.93 at Dryandra ) . Annual survival of adult at Dryandra wa c. 5 % lower than for the Wyalkatchem bird , which suggests that the habitat for the specie at the western edge of it distribution is sub-optimal . As at Wyalkatchem , productivity wa at or above replacement level only in year of above-average rainfall . Since productivity at both site wa significantly reduced in drier year , the effect of forecast global warming cause concern for this specie . Comparisons between M. pulcherrimus and the Red-winged Fairy-wren , M. elegans , illustrate how the group-living social organisation basic to all Malurus spp . can differ greatly between specie a a result of difference in survival and productivity .

aVDuring the last decade , there ha been worldwide concern with global climate change , which ha been induced by greenhouse gas ( GHGs ) due to the use of fossil fuel . The CO2 emission from fossil fuel combustion have been identified a the single most significant source of GHG emission into the atmosphere . Realizing the need to control and regulate emission of pollutant , the objective of the present study estimate the trend of CO2 SO2 and NOx between the period 1991-92 and 1996-97 . An input-output structural decomposition analysis approach is used to determine their source of change . It also provides a set of alternative scenario for the year 2001-2 and 2006-7 . The source of change in the amount of CO2 SO2 and NOx emission are categorized into four factor : the ecoefficiency , the structure of production , the structure of demand , and the volume of demand . Results indicate that the electricity sector contributes more towards direct , a well a indirect , emission coefficient . The petroleum product sector also contributes more in this respect . The dominant role is played by the structure of demand and the volume of demand .

aVWetland ecosystem are an important component in global carbon ( C ) cycle and may exert a large influence on global climate change . Predictions of C dynamic require u to consider interaction among many critical factor of soil , hydrology , and vegetation . However , few such integrated C model exist for wetland ecosystem . In this paper , we report a simulation model , Wetland-DNDC , for C dynamic and methane ( CH4 ) emission in wetland ecosystem . The general structure of Wetland-DNDC wa adopted from PnET-N-DNDC , a process-oriented biogeochemical model that simulates C and N dynamic in upland forest ecosystem . Several new function and algorithm were developed for Wetland-DNDC to capture the unique feature of wetland ecosystem , such a water table dynamic , growth of moss and herbaceous plant , and soil biogeochemical process under anaerobic condition . The model ha been validated against various observation from three wetland site in Northern America . The validation result are in agreement with the measurement of water table dynamic , soil temperature , CH4 flux , net ecosystem productivity ( NEP ) , and annual C budget . Sensitivity analysis indicates that the most critical input factor for C dynamic in the wetland ecosystem are air temperature , water outflow parameter , initial soil C content , and plant photosynthesis capacity . NEP and CH4 emission are sensitive to most of the tested input variable . By integrating the primary driver of climate , hydrology , soil and vegetation , the Wetland-DNDC model is capable of predicting C biogeochemical cycle in wetland ecosystem .

aVThe annual balance of CO2 wa measured on a subarctic flark fen located in northern Finland ( 69degrees08'N , 27degrees17'E ) . Measurements were conducted using the micrometeorological eddy covariance method during the period from April 1998 to April 1999 . Special emphasis wa put on the importance of the wintertime CO2 balance a a component of the annual budget . The CO2 flux observed during the winter were relatively small ( 0.0055 mg CO2 m ( -2 ) s ( -1 ) ) , but due to the long duration of the snow cover period , they play an important role in the annual balance of CO2 . The efflux during the coldest period , when soil surface temperature fell below -10degreesC , wa enabled by markedly higher peat temperature ( close to 0degreesC ) in deeper layer . The typical nighttime respiration observed in summer wa -0.10 mg CO2 m ( -2 ) s ( -1 ) . The net photosynthesis had a typical daytime peak value of about -0.20 mg CO2 m ( -2 ) s ( -1 ) in July . Corresponding with the instantaneous CO2 flux , the highest daily sink balance of about -9 g CO2 m ( -2 ) d ( -1 ) were observed in July , while the highest daily respiration balance of about 2.5 g CO2 m ( -2 ) d ( -1 ) were observed before and after the sink period . The CO2 balance for the winter period ( 105 g CO2 m ( -2 ) ) wa greater than the absolute value of the total annual balance ( -68 g CO2 m ( -2 ) ) , which show the importance of the wintertime efflux . After taking into account estimate for CH4 efflux and carbon leaching , an annual carbon balance of -7+/-5 g C m ( -2 ) wa obtained for the fen .

aVField study and aerial photograph interpretation suggest that large section of Jamaica Bay salt marsh in New York City near John F. Kennedy International Airport are deteriorating rapidly . The relatively recent salt marsh loss may be caused by a variety of factor , potentially interacting synergistically . Possible factor include reduced sediment input , dredging for navigation channel , boat traffic , and regional sea-level rise . Field work included aboveground biomass measurement of Spartina alterniflora , mapping plant community distribution , and documenting biogeomorphological indicator of marsh loss . Current productivity ( standing crop biomass ) , which ranged from approximately 700 to 1500 g m ( -2 ) , wa typical of healthy marsh in this region , in spite of other indicator of marsh degradation . Historical aerial photograph of several island showed that sampled marsh have diminished in size by similar to 12 % since 1959 . Overall island low marsh vegetation loss since 1974 averaged 38 % , with smaller island losing up to 78 % of their vegetation cover . Ground observation indicate that major mechanism of marsh loss include increased ponding within marsh interior , slumping along marsh edge , and widening of tidal inlet . Projections of future sea-level rise , using output from several global climate model and data from local tide gauge , in conjunction with a range of plausible accretion rate , suggest that under current stress , Jamaica Bay salt marsh are unlikely to keep pace with accelerated rate of sea-level rise in the future .

aVLife Cycle Assessment ( LCA ) is conducted for four type of plain bearing used for automotive engine . Equivalent CO2 emission ( ECE ) is used a the index of the environmental impact for global warming , and is compared among different chemical composition and different manufacturing process . Three type of aluminum alloy bearing , all of which are in the market , show little difference in ECE , irrespective of different lining constituent or the addition of an interlayer . Copper-lead alloy bearing with overlay , on the other hand , show an ECE value approximately 2.7 time a high a that for the aluminum bearing , the increment originating from the overplating process . If higher fatigue resistance of the aluminum alloy bearing is taken into consideration and their size could be reduced maintaining the same level of performance , further advantage would be found for their use .

aVA two-dimensional global climate model is used to ass the climatic change associated with the new IPCC SRES emission scenario and to determine which kind of change in total solar irradiance and volcanic perturbation could mask the projected anthropogenic global warming associated to the SRES scenario . Our result suggest that only extremely unlikely change in total solar irradiance and/or volcanic eruption would be able to overcome the simulated anthropogenic global warming over the century . Nevertheless , in the critical interval of the next two decade the externally-driven natural climate variability might possibly confuse the debate about temperature trend and impede detection of the anthropogenic climate change signal .

aVSolar ultraviolet radiation , especially UVB ( 280-320 nm ) , ha been hypothesized to be at least partially responsible for adverse effect ( e.g. , decline and malformation ) in amphibian specie throughout the world . Evaluation of this hypothesis ha been limited by the paucity of high-quality UV dose-response data and reliable estimate of typical UV dos that occur in amphibian habitat . In this preliminary risk assessment for effect of UV radiation on amphibian , dose-response relationship quantified in outdoor experiment were compared with UV exposure estimate for 26 wetland in northern Minnesota and Wisconsin . A comparison of wetland dos , derived from model prediction , historical data , and dissolved organic carbon ( DOC ) characterization , with experimental effect level for green ( R. clamitans ) , northern leopard ( R. pipiens ) , and mink ( R. septentrionalis ) frog indicated that the risk of mortality and malformation due to UV exposure is low for the majority of wetland evaluated . Wetland UV dose , averaged over the entire breeding season , exceeded effect dos for mortality for all three specie in two of the 26 wetland examined and for one specie in an additional wetland . On the basis of evidence that shorter term dos caused mortality in amphibian larva , 3-day dos were also evaluated . In three of the wetland examined , 3-day dos in excess of 85 % of full sunlight ( the level that appeared to trigger effect in controlled experimentation ) occurred at frequency ranging 22-100 % for all three specie and at frequency ranging from 15 % to 58 % for R. pipiens and R. septentrionalis in three additional wetland . Risk of malformation in R. pipiens wa apparent in five of the 26 wetland evaluated . Overall , estimated UVB dos in 21 of the wetland never exceeded experimental effect dos for mortality or malformation . These result suggest that most amphibian are not currently at significant risk for UVB effect in northern Minnesota and Wisconsin wetland . However , continued reduction of ozone and other global climate change effect may increase UV dos in wetland , suggesting that the risk of UV to amphibian should continue to be monitored and studied .

aVThe need for construction project to be sustainable is becoming more widely recognised , partly because of diminishing world energy resource , and partly because recent world development ( for example , global warming and increasing oil price ) have made those involved in construction more aware of a new approach to building . We often hear now of building with a high environmental rating , of sustainable development , and of improved comfort . The stated objective is to construct comfortable building , which use little energy and produce little pollution . This desire on the part of construction project leader ha led to some problem amongst architect . engineer and university researcher who tend to work in isolation from each other . However . the only way to achieve an overall improvement in building design is by close collaboration between the various participant , from when the first sketch of the future building is made . Of course , this task appears difficult because these participant have different approach , training and 'tools of the trade ' . This article aim to show that efficient cooperation between the professional involved is possible . We will see that by producing an instructive working document , understandable by all and based on expert rule , it is possible to produce building which are adapted to the climate . and to spread the scientific knowledge to the more practical profession . We will illustrate our idea by describing the methodology we used for a building project in the tropic . Finally . we will present a summary for the period 1997-2001 and will show the impact that such collaboration have had on the design of building in tropical climate . ( C ) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

aVThe surface warming at Faraday station in the western Antarctic Peninsula is one of the largest observed anywhere over the last 50 year , yet the physical mechanism driving this climate change are poorly understood . In this paper we synthesize radiosonde temperature observation from three Peninsula station and NCEP-NCAR reanalysis data in order to examine contemporaneous regional tropospheric temperature trend ( 1956-99 ) , which may in turn help u to understand better the cause of the surface warming . The reanalysis data are utilized in two way : ( i ) to provide long-term mean monthly offset between Faraday , which ceased radiosonde observation in 1982 , and two other station in the region having more recent data , Bellingshausen and Marambio , in order to create post-1982 simulated Faraday data ; ( ii ) after having any spurious trend and bias removed , to provide directly a monthly value for Faraday when no equivalent value from regional observation is available . Using available month of overlap , a comparison between temperature observation and simulated data suggests that the latter are a reasonable facsimile of the former . The synthesized time-series of tropospheric temperature reveal a statistically significant mean annual tropospheric ( 850-300 hPa ) warming above Faraday between 1956 and 1999 of similar to0.027 +/- 0.022degreesC year ( -1 ) . Winter and summer both show a warming trend , with significance varying with height and season . Annually , the mean tropospheric warming is half that at the surface , Unlike the surface warming , the calculated tropospheric warming trend is no greater than observed at other Antarctic station , and indeed is not significantly greater than the background global warming trend for most of the period examined . Thus , we can not dismiss the possibility that the Peninsula surface warming may simply be a response to a global warming magnified by the observed strong regional feedback between sea-ice extent and surface temperature during winter .

aVSwitzerland 's economy depends heavily on tourism . For many alpine area in the country , winter tourism is the most important source of income , and snow-reliability is one of the key element of the offer made by tourism in the Alps . The financial viability of winter tourism , however , depends on sufficient snow condition . The lack of snow at the end of the 1980s left a lasting imprint on the tourism industry . If the assumption of the impact of climate change hold true , snow cover in the Swiss Alps will diminish , and this will , in turn , jeopardise the tourism industry . 85 % of Switzerland 's current ski resort can be designated a snow-reliable . If climate change occurs , the level of snow-reliability will rise from 1200 m up to 1800 m over the next few decade . Only 44 % of the ski resort would then still be snow-reliable . While some region may be able to maintain their winter tourism with suitable adaptation strategy , others would lose all winter tourism due to a diminishing snow pack . Despite global warming , it is impossible to exclude the possibility of winter with heavy snowfall in the future ( e.g . the winter of 1998/99 , particularly February 1999 ) . Climate change must be viewed a a catalyst that is reinforcing and accelerating the pace of structural change in tourism . Today , adaptation strategy are predominant in tourism ( e.g . artificial snow production ) . As an industry that will be severely affected by climate change , however , tourism will increasingly have to focus on mitigation strategy ( e.g . le greenhouse gas emission by tourism traffic ) .

aVA high elevation data set of surface temperature from the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado , USA , is analysed for evidence of long-term change ( 1952-98 ) . Sites range from the high plain of Colorado ( 1509 m ) to the alpine tundra ( 3749 m ) . Systematic change in surface-based lapse rate are uncovered , with absolute cooling at the hi-hest elevation , but little temperature change on the high plain . There is lapse-rate steepening at the higher elevation ( > 3000 m ) . A synoptic analysis using gridded pressure data show lapse rate change to be largely independent of synoptic type . Radiosonde ascent from Denver ( 1956-98 ) and Grand Junction ( 1946-98 ) are used to derive air equivalent temperature ( AETs ) at the same elevation a the surface record . AETs show a contrasting temporal trend , with absolute warming at all level . Furthermore , free-air lapse rate are weakening at higher elevation , the warming becoming stronger with height . A comparison of the two data set through derivation of free-air-surface temperature difference show that the alpine tundra zone of the high Rockies is becoming a progressively stronger heat sink . Possible explanation include increased snow cover , enhanced air movement over the surface and decreased solar radiation input . The heat sink enhancement ha led to rapid cooling in the alpine tundra that could not be predicted from the free-air record , casting doubt upon the strong dependence on free-air temperature change in climate modelling when investigating the potential effect of global warming in mountainous region . In addition , these local surface trend are of the opposite sign to global and other regional trend identified in many recent observational and modelling study .

aVFeedbacks , or internal interaction , play a crucial role in the climate system . Negative feedback will reduce the impact of an external perturbation , a positive feedback will amplify the effect and could lead to an unstable system . Many of the feedback found in the climate system are positive ; thus , for example , increasing CO2 level will increase temperature , reduce the snow cover , increase the absorption of radiation and hence increase temperature further . The most obvious feedback , such a the snow example quoted above , are already included within our model of the climate and earth system . Others , such a the impact of increasing forest cover due to global warming , are only just being included . Others , such a , the impact of global warming on the northern peatlands and the impact of freshwater flow on the Arctic Ocean are not yet considered . The contrast in surface characteristic between low tundra vegetation to high taiga forest is considerable . The contrast is greatest in the winter , when the tundra is snow covered but the tree of the taiga protrude through the snow pack , and is probably the greatest contrast found on the land surface anywhere . This variation cause massive change in the energy flux at the surface and hence the temperature condition on the ground and within the atmosphere . There will be large resultant change in the vegetation development , the carbon flux , the permafrost and the hydrology . The Arctic is already experiencing change and it is essential for u to understand the basic process , and how these interact , to be confident of our prediction of environmental change in the future .

aVThe physiological mechanism limiting and adjusting cold and heat tolerance have regained interest in the light of global warming and associated shift in the geographical distribution of ectothermic animal . Recent comparative study , largely carried out on marine ectotherm , indicate that the process and limit of thermal tolerance are linked with the adjustment of aerobic scope and capacity of the whole animal a a crucial step in thermal adaptation on top of parallel adjustment at the molecular or membrane level . In accordance with Shelford 's law of tolerance decreasing whole animal aerobic scope characterises the onset of thermal limitation at low and high pejus threshold ( pejus = getting worse ) . The aerobic scope of an animal indicated by falling oxygen level in the body fluid and or the progressively limited capacity of circulatory and ventilatory mechanism . At high temperature , excessive oxygen demand cause insufficient oxygen level in the body fluid , whereas at low temperature the aerobic capacity of mitochondrion may become limiting for ventilation and circulation . Further cooling or warming beyond these limit lead to low or high critical threshold temperature ( T-c ) where aerobic scope disappears and transition to an anaerobic mode of mitochondrial metabolism and progressive insufficiency of cellular energy level occurs . The adjustment of mitochondrial density and their functional property appear a a critical process in defining and shifting thermal tolerance window . The finding of an oxygen limited thermal tolerance owing to loss of aerobic scope is in line with Taylor 's and Weibel 's concept of symmorphosis , which implies that excess capacity of any component of the oxygen delivery system is avoided . The present study suggests that the capacity of oxygen delivery is set to a level just sufficient to meet maximum oxygen demand between the average high and low of environmental temperature . At more extreme temperature only time limited passive survival is supported by anaerobic metabolism or the protection of molecular function by heat shock protein and antioxidative defence . As a corollary , the first line of thermal sensitivity is due to capacity limitation at a high level of organisational complexity , i.e . the integrated function of the oxygen delivery system , before individual , molecular or membrane function become disturbed . These interpretation are in line with the more general consideration that , a a result of the high level of complexity of metazoan organism compared with simple eukaryote and then prokaryote , thermal tolerance is reduced in metazoan . A similar sequence of sensitivity prevails within the metazoan organism , with the highest sensitivity at the organismic level and wider tolerance window at lower level of complexity . However , the situation is different in that loss in aerobic scope and progressive hypoxia at the organismic level define the onset of thermal limitation which then transfer to lower hierarchical level and cause cellular and molecular disturbance . Oxygen limitation contributes to oxidative stress and , finally , denaturation or malfunction of molecular repair , e.g . during suspension of protein synthesis . The sequence of thermal tolerance limit turn into a hierarchy , ranging from systemic to cellular to molecular level . ( C ) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Inc .

aVTo predict the consequence of human-induced global climate change , we need to understand how climate is linked to biogeography ( 1 ) . Energetic constraint are commonly invoked to explain animal distribution , and physiological parameter are known to vary along distributional gradient ( 2 ) . But the causal nature of the link between climate and animal biogeography remain largely obscure ( 2,3 ) . Here we develop a bioenergetic model that predicts the feasibility of mammalian hibernation under different climatic condition . As an example , we use the well-quantified hibernation energetics of the little brown bat ( Myotis lucifugus ) to parameterize the model ( 4 ) . Our model predicts pronounced effect of ambient temperature on total winter energy requirement , and a relatively narrow combination of hibernaculum temperature and winter length permitting successful hibernation . Microhabitat and northern distribution limit of M. lucifugus are consistent with model prediction , suggesting that the thermal dependence of hibernation energetics constrains the biogeography of this specie . Integrating projection of climate change into our model predicts a pronounced northward range expansion of hibernating bat within the next 80 year . Bioenergetics can provide the simple link between climate and biogeography needed to predict the consequence of climate change .

aVEmission trading is a good concept and approach to tackle global warming . However , what `` currency '' or `` credit '' should be used in the trading ha remained a debatable topic . This paper proposed an `` Energy Credit '' concept a an alternative to the `` CO2 credit '' that is currently in place . From the thermodynamic point of view , the global warming problem is an `` energy balance '' problem . The energy credit concept is thought to be more thermodynamically correct and tackle the core of the global warming problem more directly . The Energy credit concept proposed can be defined a : the credit to offset the extra energy trapped/absorbed in the earth ( and it atmosphere ) due to the extra anthropogenic emission ( or other activity ) by a country or company . A couple of example are given in the paper to demonstrate the concept of the Energy credit and it advantage over the CO2 credit concept . ( C ) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd .

aVSign of grizzly bear ( Ursus arctos horribilis ) consuming fungal sporocarp ( mushroom and truffle ) wa observed on 68 occasion during a study of radiomarked bear in the Yellowstone region , 1977-96 . Sporocarps also were detected in96 grizzly bear feces . Most fungi consumed by Yellowstone 's grizzly bear were member of the Boletaceae ( Suillus spp . ) , Russulaceae ( Russula spp . and Lactarius sp . ) , Morchellaceae ( Morchella elata ) , and Rhizopogonaceae . Consumption of false truffle ( Rhizopogon spp . ) wa indicated by excavation that were deeper , on average ( 1.1 dm ) , than excavation for mushroom ( 0.6 dm ) . Consumptionof sporocarp wa most frequent during September ( 7 % of all activity ) , although median number of sporocarp excavated at feeding site peaked during both August and September ( 22-23 excavations/site ) . Almost all consumption ( 75 % ) occurred on edaphically harsh site typically dominated by lodgepole pine ( Pinuscontorta ) . At broad scale , consumption of sporocarp wa most likely where these type of lodgepole pine-dominated site were extensive or where high-elevation site supporting mature whitebark pine ( P. albicaulis ) were rare . The number of sporocarp excavated at a feeding site wa greatest when cone crop ofwhitebark pine were small and in stand with abundant lodgepole pine . At finescales , consumption of fungi wa positively associated with lodgepole pine basal area and negatively associated with total ground vegetation cover . Becauseof the strong association of sporocarp consumption with lodgepole pine and it disassociation at broad scale with availability of whitebark pine seed , consumption of mushroom and truffle by grizzly bear will likely increase in the Yellowstone ecosystem with global warming . Lodgepole pine is predicted to increase and whitebark pine to decline with global warming .

aV[ 1 ] The response of large store of carbon in boreal forest soil to global warming is a major uncertainty in predicting the future carbon budget . We measured the temperature dependence of decomposition for upland boreal peat under black spruce forest with sphagnum and feather moss understory using incubation experiment . CO2 efflux rate clearly responded to temperature , which ranged from -10degrees to +8degreesC by similar to2degreesC increment . At temperature below 0degreesC , significant decomposition wa observed in feather moss peat but not in wetter sphagnum peat . Above 0degreesC , decomposition wa exponentially related to temperature , corresponding to a Q ( 10 ) ( the ratio of the rate of CO2 evolution at one temperature divided by that at a temperature 10degreesC cooler ) of 4.4 for feather moss and 3.1 for sphagnum peat . The greatest change in CO2 evolution rate with temperature occurred between -2degrees and 0degreesC , which coincided with the phase transition of soil water . We saw no large change in the rate of CO2 evolution between incubation experiment separated by a 6 month storage period for feather moss peat . Stable C isotope measurement of evolved CO2 and the rate of change of CO2 evolution with time suggest different substrate are used to sustain heterotrophic respiration above and below freezing . Radiocarbon signature of CO2 respired from both type of peat reflected significant contribution from C fixed in the last 35 year ( `` bomb '' C-14 ) a well a C fixed prior to 1950 . We observed no change in the Delta ( 14 ) C of respired CO2 with temperature . Isotopic signature of peat component showed that a combination of substrate must contribute to the CO2 evolved in our incubation . Decomposition of fine root ( which made up le than 7 % of the total peat C ) accounted for similar to50 % of respired CO2 in feather moss peat and for similar to30 % of respired CO2 in sphagnum peat . Fine-grained ( < 1 mm ) , more humified material that make up 60-70 % of the bulk peat organic carbon contributed significantly to heterotrophic respiration ( & SIM ; 30 % in feather moss and & SIM ; 50 % in sphagnum moss peat ) , despite slow decomposition rate . Increased temperature caused enhanced decomposition from all pool without changing their relative contribution . Because the contribution of peat decomposition is a small portion of total soil respiration at the study site , increased respiration rate would be difficult to measure a increased flux in the field . Nonetheless , sustained warming could lead to significant loss of C from these peat layer .

aVPermafrost-favorable climatic condition for the 21st century a predicted by two coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model ( ECHAM4/OPYC3 and HadCM3 ) were compared . The severity index [ 1 ] related to the air-frost index [ 2 ] wa used to characterize the local climatic condition favoring the formation of permafrost . Anthropogenic forcing scenario involving a general increase in the atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration with and without anthropogenic sulfate aerosol emission were considered . The model simulation were compared to paleoclimatic reconstruction of the southern boundary of different permafrost zone for two past warm period with different degree of global warming . The method proposed for comparing the model result between themselves and with paleoclimatic data showed that the sensitivity of the continuous permafrost area to global warming differs substantially in different model but is virtually independent of the applied radiation forcing scenario in an individual model . For the scenario with a constant atmospheric aerosol content , the result of the atmospheric general circulation model were compared to those produced by the IFA RAN climate model of intermediate complexity , whose sensitivity wa found to be similar to the sensitivity of the ECHAM4/OPYC3 model . A comparison of the ECHAM4/OPYC3 result to paleoclimatic reconstruction showed that the southern boundary of continuous permafrost over the former USSR region in the Holocene optimum ( 6000 before present ( BP ) ) is similar to the condition in the mid-21st century a predicted by the ECHAM4/OPYC3 model with allowance for aerosol emission . In the absence of aerosol emission , these condition were found to be in better agreement with the permafrost distribution during the Eemian interglacial ( 125 000 BP ) .

aVEnvironmental legislation is increasing the amount of bought-in electricity required for sewage treatment , and generating larger volume of sewage sludge to be treated and disposed of Concurrently , concern over global warming and food safety from sewage sludge recycling on agricultural land is augmenting the cost of conventional sewage and sludge treatment technology and practice . This paper review some emerging technology and practice that may assist in mitigating these problem in the future . In addition , a number of potential renewable energy technology available to water company are reviewed . Results suggest that through the take-up of new technology , current and future water quality standard could be delivered in a more sustainable way . However , this series of paper also highlight that institutional and political conflict may have inadvertently failed to recognise the wider effect of improving water quality and lessened the financial support necessary for their widespread take-up . It is also suggested that through the use of a Strategic Environmental Assessment ( SEA ) approach , stakeholder could gain a better understanding of the broader environmental effect of achieving certain water quality standard and develop policy and long-term investment strategy accordingly . However , to fulfil the information requirement of an SEA , an appropriate appraisal tool that considers many of these factor in unison is required , and a possible technique is suggested .

aVThe ability of agricultural land to sequester carbon from the atmosphere and help mitigate global warming ha the potential to add value to farmland through the development of carbon-credit trading . Crucial to the creation of a market-based carbon credit trading system is the monitoring and verification of agricultural practice that promote carbon storage . Using remotely sensed image for this purpose could prove more efficient and cost-effective than traditional land-based method . Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus ( ETM+ ) imagery and logistic regression had & gt ; 95 % accuracy in verifying no-till fallow field . Further research is needed to investigate the potential for this low-cost technology to assist in the monitoring and verification of practice that sequester carbon . Development of an accurate , low-cost , efficient mean of monitoring and verifying carbon sequestering practice wilt further the development of cropland carbon credit , thus helping to mitigate global warming , and will add value to U.S. farmland .

aVDung beetle are useful a indicator in conservation and global warming study owing to their specialized regional and local distribution pattern . However , existing South African data are inadequate for indication at the necessary degree of spatial resolution . To improve the database , Survey method need to Lie designed according to the spatial and temporal factor that influence dung beetle diversity . Across four major climatic region , there are seven principal specie distribution centre for dung beetle in which activity is influenced primarily by difference , in rainfall seasonality and temperature , Across these region , generic endemism is largely concentrated around the coastline and in montane area . The conservation status of endemic genus is discussed . At a local scale , spatial diversity is influenced primarily by soil , vegetation and dung type . Maximum local diversity of dung beetle is observed after rainfall and decrease a surface condition become warmer and drier . After workshop discussion , a coarse-grained , asymmetrical gradsect survey grid ha been designed according to vegetative , climatic and land-usage gradient across South Africa . It is suggested that each survey point across these regional gradient should comprise a quarter-degree square in which local ecological gradient should be surveyed for invertebrate , Baited pitfall trapping is an easy method to provide quantitative data for dung beetle across such environmental gradient . Lining up each catch on a tray provides a relatively quick way to compare the specimen , identify the specie present , and provide a quantitative assessment of specie abundance . Data collection may be conducted on one or more occasion. , to accommodate seasonal and daily variation in specie occurrence . This exercise could identify locality suitable for ecotourism reserve representative of the variation in ecotypes across the country , particularly , in coastal , natural grass and wooded region , where many invertebrate taxon are endangered by habitat fragmentation including some rare dung beetle specie .

aVThe climatic and environmental change associated with the last glaciation ( 90,000 to 10,000 year before the present ; 90 to 10 ka B.P . ) are an important example of the effect of global climate change on biological diversity . These effect were particularly marked in Beringia ( northeastern Siberia , northwestern North America , and the exposed Bering Strait ) during the late Pleistocene . To investigate the evolutionary impact of these event , we studied genetic change in the brown bear , Ursus arctos , in eastern Beringia over the past 60,000 year using DNA preserved in permafrost remains . A marked degree of genetic structure is observed in population throughout this period despite local extinction , reinvasions , and potential interspecies competition with the short-faced bear , Arctodus simus . The major phylogeographic change occurred 35 to 21 ka B.P. , before the glacial maximum , and little change is observed after this time . Late Pleistocene history of mammalian taxon may be more complex than those that might be inferred from the fossil record or contemporary DNA sequence atone .

aVPassive cloche were deployed for 27 month ( three austral summer ) at Cape Bird , Ross Island , Antarctica ( 77degrees13 'S , 166degrees26'E ) to investigate the response of soil invertebrate to increased temperature . Soil surface temperature in cloche were significantly higher than in lidless control plot or unmanipulated site . Soil surface in cloche plot exceeded 0 C and 8 C ( the approximate threshold for growth and development in several invertebrate specie ) for longer than in control plot . No consistent change in population of Gomphiocephalus hodgsoni ( Collembola ) , Stereotydeus mollis ( Acari ) Nanorchestes antarcticus ( Acari ) or observed in the cloche plot after 3 growing season at higher temperature . Abundance of S. mollis wa strongly related to algal biomass , but abundance of other specie were not clearly related to the environmental characteristic of manipulation plot . Although low temperature may have a role a a limiting factor on a geographical scale , local population of invertebrate are probably influenced more by the availability of liquid water ; and invertebrate response could be very slow owing to short growing season and long life cycle in continental Antarctica .

aVThe impact of air conditioning and refrigeration system on stratospheric ozone are primarily linked to release of ozone-depleting refrigerant . Their contribution to global warming stem both from release of refrigerant and from emission of greenhouse gas ( GHGs ) for associated energy use . Because the energy-related component ha a significantly higher warming impact , phaseout of hydrofluorocarbon ( HFC ) refrigerant with le efficient option will increase net GHG emission . The same conclusion applies for perfluorocarbon ( PFCs ) , though they are le commonly used a refrigerant . Integrated assessment of ozone depletion , global warming , and atmospheric lifetime provides essential indication in the absence of ideal refrigerant , namely those free of these problem a well a safety , stability , compatibility , cost , and similar burden . This study examines the trend in refrigerant loss from chiller use . It document both substantial progress in release reduction and the technical innovation to achieve them . It contrast the impact of current refrigerant with alternative and with the chlorofluorocarbon ( CFCs ) they replaced . The study examines the sensitivity of efficiency to charge loss . It also summarizes thermodynamic and environmental comparison of option to show that phaseout decision based on chemical composition alone , without regard to attribute of individual substance , can result in greater environmental harm than benefit .

aVorder to estimate the past groundwater recharge rate from deep borehole temperature data , observed temperature-depth profile are compared with the profile calculated from heat conduction-convection equation under the condition of linear increase in surface temperature due to global warming and urbanization in Tokyo metropolitan area . The result show the increase in groundwater recharge rate from the 1890s to 1940s , and it decreased from the 1940s to 1990s . These estimation agree well with the precipitation record in Tokyo during the last 100 year . Therefore , the deep borehole temperature data can be used for estimating not only surface temperature history but also the past groundwater recharge rate in Tokyo area .

aVAnalysis of evaporation measurement made between 1964 and 1998 at Bet Dagan in Israel 's central coastal plain show a small but statistically significant increase in screened Class A pan evaporation , mainly in the dry , summer half of the year . No change were found in the total open water evaporation or reference crop evapotranspiraton estimated with Penman 's combined heat balance and aerodynamic equation because the decrease found in the radiation balance term were offset by increase in the aerodynamic term . The climatic change responsible for these opposing trend were , respectively , decrease in global irradiance and increase in water vapor pressure deficit ( VPD ) and wind speed , the latter associated with change in wind direction . Increases in windspeed were found to be concentrated in afternoon hour of summer and fall month , while those of VPD were in the late afternoon of fall month . Possible reason for these change are discussed . Normalized pan evaporation for dry month showed no significant time trend , but a significant increase wa found for wet month . These result support the view that the widespread reduction in potential evaporation that have been reported , although not found at Bet Dagan , were caused by global dimming rather than an increase in the rate of atmospheric moisture cycling due to global warming .

aV[ 1 ] Nannoplankton assemblage at Ocean Drilling Program Site 690 ( Maud Rise , Weddell Sea ) experienced an abrupt and dramatic transformation at the onset of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum ( PETM ) at similar to55 m.y . The major assemblage shift suggests a change from colder , more productive surface water to warmer , more oligotrophic condition . Significant restructuring of assemblage during the later part of the PETM indicates that nannoplankton community were not stable and that surface water condition changed , although they remained warm and oligotrophic . Combined with benthic foraminiferal assemblage data , nannoplankton assemblage result suggest increased sequestration of nutrient in shelf environment and starvation of the open ocean . Although the PETM wa a short-lived event , it appears to have had long-term effect on nannoplankton , leading to the extinction of Fasciculithus , a dominant Paleocene genus .

This study investigated AMS C-14 , delta ( 18 ) O , planktonic foraminifer assemblage and sedimentation rate in three piston core collected in the Indonesian Archipelago . The result indicate that change in the Indonesian Archipelago heat transport pathway were phase characteristic and in step during the last deglaciation . In the deglaciation Termination IA , at about 12.5 kaBP , sea level rose rapidly in a short time period , and Makassar and Lombok strait widened suddenly for warm and fresh water from the Pacific to pour into the Java Sea and eastern Indian Ocean . During the Termination IB , about 9.5 kaBP , sea level rose rapidly again , and the South China Sea ( SCS ) started to connect with the Java Sea . With monsoon action , a large amount of fresh water from the SCS shelf area flew through the Indonesian Archipelago .

It had developed three Costa Rican field station ( La Selva , Las Cruces , and Palo Verde ) with excellent facility for teaching and research , and it wa constructing a new Costa Rican office at the University of Costa Rica . Combinations of internal and external pressure influenced OTS to develop in new direction in the 1980s and 1990s . It became more diversified and more concerned with applied science in it traditional area of graduate education and research facilitation . The Organization also evolved into new niche : more applied biology , professional education , environmental education and policy , conservation effort , and an expanded geographic distribution to other Latin American country . OTS wa composed of changing combination of people ( Boards , member , staff ) with evolving and competing priority for limited financial resource . External environmental change also shaped OTS 's evolution . New problem of increased tropical deforestation , the emergence of the biodiversity `` crisis '' and conservation biology , global climate change , and call for sustainable development affected OTS constituent and funding priority of government and foundation . Both internal and external pressure have in some case demanded for OTS to improve it relationship with : Costa Rican biologist and their institution , the Costa Rican government , and Costa Ricans living around the three OTS field station .

aVThis study explores whether the high variability of vascular plant diversity among alpine plant community can be explained by stress and/or disturbance intensity . Species number of 14 alpine plant community were sampled in the Swiss Alps . To quantify the intensity of 13 stress and 6 disturbance factor potentially controlling plant life in these community , a survey wa conducted by asking numerous specialist in alpine vegetation to ass the importance of the different factor for each community . The estimated value were combined in stress- and disturbance-indices which were compared with diversity according to the Intermediate Stress Hypothesis , the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis , and the Dynamic Equilibrium Model , respectively . Each of these theory explained a part of the variability in the specie richness , but only the Dynamic Equilibrium Model provided a complete and consistent explanation . The last model suggests that community specie richness within the alpine life zone is generally controlled by stress intensity . Disturbance and competition seem to play a secondary role by fine-tuning diversity in specific community . As diversity is primarily limited by stress , a moderation of temperature-related stress factor , a a result of global warming , may cause a shift of the equilibrium between stress , disturbance , and competition in alpine ecosystem .

aVSoutheast Spain ha a semiarid climate with highly variable rainfall from year to year . Global warming scenario predict a decrease in rainfall in future and land-use change may also alter run-off regime . Water deficit ha meant that various practice of floodwater farming have traditionally operated in valley floor . However , flash flood in the valley floor can also be dangerous and damaging . Many of the boqueras and other floodwater irrigation system have been abandoned . The effect on the hydrological regime of the channel are calculated . These structure and water management practice could have an effect on the magnitude of low-moderate peak discharge , but are insignificant in high flow . Modem channel and flood management employ check dam , but these are frequently destroyed in moderate-high flow . Alternative strategy of channel management need to be sought and the use or vegetation cover to dissipate flood peak and to reduce erosion may offer one possibility .

aVGlobal climate are changing rapidly , with unexpected consequence ( 1 ) . Because element of biodiversity respond intimately to climate a an important driving force of distributional limitation ( 2 ) , distributional shift and biodiversity loss are expected ( 3,4 ) . Nevertheless , in spite of modelling effort focused on single specie ( 2 ) or entire ecosystem ( 5 ) , a few preliminary survey of fauna-wide effect ( 6,7 ) , and evidence of climate change-mediated shift in several specie ( 8,9 ) , the likely effect of climate change on specie ' distribution remain little known , and fauna-wide or community-level effect are almost completely unexplored ( 6 ) . Here , using a genetic algorithm and museum specimen occurrence data , we develop ecological niche model for 1,870 specie occurring in Mexico and project them onto two climate surface modelled for 2055 . Although extinction and drastic range reduction are predicted to be relatively few , specie turnover in some local community is predicted to be high ( > 40 % of specie ) , suggesting that severe ecological perturbation may result .

aVGenetic variation and spatial genetic structure in balsam fir ( Abies balsamea ) were examined in two isolated population in Iowa and Minnesota thought to be paleorefugia and in two ecologically central population in old-growth forest of Upper Michigan . Overall level of genetic variability at 22 allozyme locus were lower than that found in most conifer specie ( H-o value ranged from 0.005 in the isolated population to 0.025 in the central population ) . The mean F-IS value ( 0.154 ) wa larger than usually found in conifer and suggests moderate level of inbreeding . The mean F-ST , an estimate of genetic diversity among population , wa 3.7 % of the total diversity , a value lower than the mean for conifer . Nm , the number of migrant per generation , wa 6.5 , suggesting either some gene flow among population or a lack of genetic differentiation . Spatial autocorrelation analysis revealed a moderately patchy structure , with gene flow distance of 30-70 m in the central population and at least 10 m in the isolated population . The future of the ecologically central population depends on maintenance of an intact forest mosaic . The low genetic variability in the small , isolated population suggests that habitat fragmentation ha led to a reduction in evolutionary potential and that the future viability of these population will likely require active management in the face of global climate change .

aVMontane ( alpine ) area are generally of high value for nature conservation . Such environment and the habitat they support are dynamic and often fragile . They are vulnerable to disturbance from a range of human activity and are responsive to climate change over short and long timescales . Biodiversity and conservation value are closely linked to geological history , geomorphological process and soil , and it is crucial that management system are based on understanding these link . There are many similarity between the Cairngorm Mountains ( Scotland ) , the Giant Mountains ( Czech Republic ) and Abisko Mountains ( Sweden ) in term of geology , geomorphology , ecology , link with biodiversity and high conservation importance . Comparable pressure and management issue involve , to varying degree , a history of human use and impact from deforestation , pasturing , grazing , recreation and atmospheric pollution . Landscape change therefore involves a complex interplay between natural and anthropogenic factor . Managing such change requires better understanding of the geo-ecological process involved and the factor that determine landscape sensitivity . This is illustrated through a simple framework and example from the three area . Comparison of landscape sensitivity between similar montane area , but in different geographic location and climatic environment , should allow more informed management planning and a precautionary approach in advance of further change in human activity and from predicted global warming scenario .

aVGeological sequestration of anthropogenic carbon dioxide is a potential solution to the release into the atmosphere Of CO2 , a greenhouse gas thought of a significantly contributing to the global warming trend observed since the beginning of the industrial revolution . Basically , CO2 can be sequestered in geological medium : 1 ) through enhanced oil recovery ( EOR ) , 2 ) by storage in depleted oil and gas reservoir , 3 ) through replacement by CO2 of methane in deep coal bed ( ECBMR ) , 4 ) by injection into deep saline aquifer , and 5 ) by storage in salt cavern . Criteria in assessing the suitability of a sedimentary basin for CO2 sequestration are : a ) tectonism and geology , b ) the flow of formation water and geothermal regime , and c ) the existence of storage medium ( hydrocarbon reservoir , coal seam , deep aquifer and salt structure ) . Generally , the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin is suitable for CO2 sequestration by all mean because it is tectonically stable , it ha regional-scale aquifer confined by aquitards or aquicludes , and it ha oil and gas reservoir in various stage of depletion , uneconomic coal seam , and extensive salt bed . However , various region in the basin have different degree of suitability , ranging from not suitable along the eastern edge of the basin , to extremely suitable in southwestern and central Alberta . Most major CO2 producer , such a power plant and refinery around Edmonton , are found in region that are unsuitable for CO2 sequestration in geological medium ; however , some , such a the oil sand plant in the Athabasca area , are in region that are not suitable . This analysis of the suitability of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin for CO2 sequestration in geological medium should provide industry and government with essential information needed for developing plan and policy in response to climate change effect of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission into the atmosphere .

aVThe burning of fossil fuel , the large-scale clearing of forest , and other human activity are altering global climate at an alarming rate . The continued consumption of fossil fuel is expected to result in a doubling of the current [ CO2 ] by sometime in this century . These increase in CO2 a well a other & ldquo ; greenhouse gas & rdquo ; are expected to raise world temperature by 0.03 & deg ; C per year in the 21st century . Global warming and increased atmospheric [ CO2 ] are already having a major impact on plant distribution . Plants , in general , benefit from slightly warmer temperature and higher [ CO2 ] , but not all plant will benefit equally from these condition , and some may even be harmed : There will be winner and loser in the warmer world of the near future . If the past is any indicator , the loser may greatly outnumber the winner . Pala-eobotanical evidence indicates that there wa a 4-fold increase in atmospheric [ CO2 ] across the Triassic-Jurassic boundary and an associated 3 & deg ; C to 4 & deg ; C & ldquo ; greenhouse & rdquo ; warming ( McElwain et al. , 1999 ) . These environmental condition were calculated to have raised leaf temperature above a highly conserved lethal limit , perhaps contributing to the & gt ; 95 % species-level turnover of Triassic-Jurassic megaflora . Are we destined to witness a floral mass extinction of similar proportion in the coming few century ? The data and model discussed in this month 's column suggest that the mass extinction , or at least the mass ecological upheaval , ha already begun.Previous SectionNext Section

aV2001 wa the second-warmest year over the last 150 year . It wa 0.43degreesC above the 1961-1990 global average , just behind the record of 1998 with it 0.59degreesC above the normal . In parallel , CO2 ha increased from 280 to 370 ppmv since the Industrial Revolution , at a rate 100 time faster than over the last 20 000 year . In it Third Assessment Report , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) state clearly that `` an increasing body of observation give a collective picture of a warming world and other change in the climate system '' and that `` there is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 year is attributable to human activity '' . Comparison of model result with present-day climatic observation and past climate reconstruction allows to conclude that the model capture relatively well both the natural climatic variation and the impact of man 's activity on climate . This make possible to draw conclusion from modeling result obtained for the next century . The globally averaged surface temperature is projected to increase by 1.4 to 5.8degreesC over the period 1990 to 2100 and sea level to rise by 9 to 88 cm for the full range of the IPCC scenario .

aVUsing museum specimen collected in Israel during the second half of the 20th century , no support wa found for the hypothesis that body mass and tarsus length of chukar partridge Alectoris chukar ha changed a a result of global warming . Body mass showed fluctuation during the year , reaching a maximum in late winter and spring and a minimum in summer . Bergmann 's rule predicts that in warm-blooded animal , race from warm region will be smaller than race from colder region , and a wider explanation state that body size is positively related to latitude . Because of it topography and varied climate , Israel provides a unique opportunity to separate partly the effect of latitude from that of ambient temperature , thus testing if Bergmann 's rule is related to latitude or to climatic variable . We found that body mass ( and marginally also tarsus length ) declined significantly with decreasing latitude in accordance with the wider explanation of Bergmann 's rule , but ambient temperature explained a much smaller fraction of the variation in body mass than latitude . These result weaken the traditional explanation to Bergmann 's rule that a heat conservation mechanism cause the latitudinal size variation .

aVA climate change scenario experiment conducted with the state-of-the-art coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model ECHAM4/OPYC3 is analysed with the objective to quantify change in present-day Arctic permafrost condition . An efficient procedure is adopted which overcomes the many problem associated with an explicit treatment of soil freezing and thawing process . The zero degree soil temperature a well a induced permafrost index characteristic simulated by the model for present day condition match well the observed permafrost zonation . For a future scenario of greenhouse gas emission ( SRES A2 issued by IPCC ) , we estimate the amount that the permafrost zone move poleward and how the thickness of the active layer deepens in response to the global warming by the end of the 21st century . The simulation indicates a 30-40 % increase in active-layer thickness for most of the permafrost area in the Northern Hemisphere , with largest relative increase concentrated in the northernmost location .

aVTo investigate the impact of anthropogenic global warming on tropical cyclone ( TC ) activity , climate simulation were conducted under the present , and CO2-warmed condition , using the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate Model version 2 . The CO2-warmed condition includes doubled atmospheric CO2 concentration , and about 1 degreesC of tropical sea surface temperature ( SST ) warming . Simulated TCs were objectively selected from twice daily instantaneous output during an eight-year time integration period of each simulation . The change associated with global warming were examined in term of the frequency of occurrence , and mean intensity of TCs . The frequency of global TC occurrence remains unchanged in response to the CO2-induced warming . Although the hydrologic cycle is generally enhanced in the warmed climate , increased precipitation doe not necessarily make a great impact on TC activity . This unchanged global TC frequency seems to coincide with almost neutral variation in the zonally-averaged moist instability in the tropic . However , there is some uncertainty in the model regarding the treatment of physical process that control moisture distribution in the middle to lower troposphere . On the regional scale , the CO2-induced change in TC occurrence were generally not statistically significant . TC intensity were enhanced over warmed SST region in the western Pacific , which contribute to the significantly increased mean intensity of global TCs .

aVMost of the projected global population increase will take place in third world country that already suffer from water , food , and health problem . Increasingly , the various water us ( municipal , industrial , and agricultural ) must be coordinated with , and integrated into , the overall water management of the region . Sustainability , public health , environmental protection , and economics are key factor . More storage of water behind dam and especially in aquifer via artificial recharge is necessary to save water in time of water surplus for use in time of water shortage . Municipal wastewater can be an important water resource but it use must be carefully planned and regulated to prevent adverse health effect and , in the case of irrigation , undue contamination of groundwater . While almost all liquid fresh water of the planet occurs underground a groundwater , it long-term suitability a a source of water is threatened by nonpoint source pollution from agriculture and other source and by aquifer depletion due to groundwater withdrawal in excess of groundwater recharge . In irrigated area , groundwater level may have to be controlled with drainage or pumped well system to prevent waterlogging and salinization of soil . Salty drainage water must then be handled in an ecologically responsible way . Water short country can save water by importing most of their food and electric power from other country with more water , so that in essence they also get the water that wa necessary to produce these commodity and , hence , is virtually embedded in the commodity . This `` virtual '' water tends to be a lot cheaper for the receiving country than developing it own water resource . Local water can then be used for purpose with higher social , ecological , or economic return or saved for the future . Climate change in response to global warming caused by carbon dioxide emission are difficult to predict in space and time . Resulting uncertainty require flexible and integrated water management to handle water surplus , water shortage , and weather extreme . Long-term storage behind dam and in aquifer may be required . Rising sea level will present problem in coastal area .

aVFive population-specific response function were developed from quadratic model for 110 population of Pinus sylvestris growing at 47 planting site in Eurasia and North America . The function predict 13 year height from climate : degree-days > 5 degreesC ; mean annual temperature ; degree-days 5 degreesC to mean annual precipitation . Validation of the response function with two set of independent data produced for all function statistically significant simple correlation with coefficient a high a 0.81 between actual and predicted height . The response function described the widely different growth potential typical of natural population and demonstrated that these growth potential have different climatic optimum . Populations nonetheless tend to inhabit climate colder than their optimum , with the disparity between the optimal and inhabited climate becoming greater a the climate becomes more severe . When driven by a global warming scenario of the Hadley Center , the function described short-term physiologic and long-term evolutionary effect that were geographically complex . The short-term effect should be negative in the warmest climate but strongly positive in the coldest . Long-term effect eventually should ameliorate the negative short-term impact , enhance the positive , and in time , substantially increase productivity throughout most of the contemporary pine forest of Eurasia . Realizing the long-term gain will require redistribution of genotype across the landscape , a process that should take up to 13 generation and therefore many year .

aVGlobal climate change ha been one of the most challenging environmental concern facing policy maker in the past decade . The characterization of the wide range of greenhouse gas ( GHG ) source and sink a well a the behavior of GHGs in the atmosphere remains an on-going activity in many country . Lebanon , being a signatory to the Framework Convention on Climate Change , is required to submit and regularly update a national inventory of GHG emission source and removal . Accordingly , an inventory of greenhouse gas from various sector wa conducted following the guideline set by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change . The inventory indicated that the land use , land use change , and forestry sector contributed about 1 % to the total greenhouse gas emission instead of acting a a sink . This article proposes mitigation scenario to reduce these emission and increase carbon sequestration in the Lebanese land use . Limitations in emission estimation , economic valuation , and policy option are also addressed .

aVThe primary motivation for this paper is to illuminate the role of leadership exerted by individual , institution and nation-states at various stage of the global climate change regime , Four form of leadership : intellectual , instrumental , power-based , and directional , are identified , Next , theoretical claim about the dominance of particular form of leadership at particular stage of regime formation are empirically tested by examining the agenda setting and negotiation phase of the climate regime . This analysis tends to support theoretical claim that intellectual leadership is particularly prominent during agenda setting , but evidence to support the influence of entrepreneurial leader during negotiation is mixed at best for the climate regime . Structural or power based leadership meanwhile wa largely absent during agenda setting of the climate regime but ha been in clear evidence through the negotiation of the Climate Convention and the Kyoto Protocol .

aV[ 1 ] The environmental damage caused by atmospheric pollutant is proportional to the duration of their effect . The global impact of greenhouse gas ( a measured by global warming potential ) and ozone depleting substance ( a measured by ozone depletion potential ) have traditionally been calculated using the atmospheric lifetime of the source gas a a quantitative measure of the impact 's duration , assuming that the gas quickly reach a steady-state pattern which decay exponentially according to the lifetime . This assumed behavior obviously doe not match the true rise and fall of impact , particularly secondary one like ozone depletion , that can be seen in numerical integration or chemical mode decomposition . Here , the mode decomposition is used to prove that : ( a ) the steady-state pattern of impact caused by specified emission , multiplied by ( b ) the steady-state lifetime of the source gas for that emission pattern , is exactly equal to ( c ) the integral of all impact - independent of the number and atmospheric residence time of secondary impact .

aVOver the past three decade , with a combination of new technology , rising female literacy rate , and strengthened family planning program , the world ha seen dramatic increase in the use of contraception , with corresponding decline in fertility and population growth rate . At the International Conference on Population and Development , Cairo in 1994 , party pledged a tripling of funding for reproductive health program in developing country . Many demographer believe that making such program more widely available to woman would extend the decline in birth rate and shift the world towards the low scenario of United Nations population projection over the next century and a half . By examining the cost and impact of such program , in view of the link between population and carbon emission , this paper show that extension of voluntary family planning could make a large and cost-effective contribution to the greenhouse gas limitation goal of the Kyoto Protocol that wa negotiated in 1997 .

aVIn this study , long-term ( 1987-1998 ) dynamic are described on a local scale ( & lt ; 20 km ) for coral reef in St. John , US Virgin Islands , which are located in a marine protected area ( MPA ) . The study consists of two site ( Yawzi and Tektite ) which were selected in 1987 based on relatively high coral cover ( =32 % ) , and six site that were randomly selected in 1992 . Over 12 year , mean coral cover at Yawzi ( 9 in depth ) changed significantly , declining from 45 to 20 % cover between 1987 and 1998 ( a 56 % reduction ) . Less than I kin away at Tektite ( 14 in depth ) , coral cover also changed significantly , but here . it increased 34 % ( from 32 to 43 % cover ) . Over the same period , macroalgal cover showed a significant upward trend at both site , increasing from 2 to 26 % at Yawzi , and from 6 to 13 % at Tektite . The random site ( 7-9 in depth ) differed from the initial site in both community structure and dynamic . Mean coral cover at the random site ( similar to8 % ) wa le than one third of that at Yawzi and Tektite , and varied significantly among site and year in an idiosyncratic pattern . The percentage cover of macroalgae and the pooled coverage of crustose coralline algae , algal turf , and bare space showed a strong site x time interaction , illustrating that the site differed in dynamic , but that the difference varied among time . Thus , a ha been reported elsewhere in the Caribbean , serious reef degradation ha occurred on at least one reef in St. John , but the pattern of change vary markedly on a kilometer-wide scale . In comparison with other long-term study of Caribbean coral reef , the degradation of a coral reef in an MPA around St. John is noteworthy since there are few local anthropogenic disturbance that can be held responsible for the decline . The strong possibility that large-scale event such a hurricane and global warming have played a pivotal role in the decline of at least one reef in St. John emphasizes the need to embrace landscape- and regional-scale phenomenon in order to understand and manage local coral reef dynamic . The occurrence of small patch of relatively healthy reef ( i.e. , at Tektite ) appears trivial in comparison to region-wide reef decline , but such anomaly should be studied further because of their potential role a refugia for coral and reef-associated taxon .

aVMuch attention is recently paid to the global warming observed in the 20th century , and especially to the relative impact of natural and anthropogenic factor responsible for it . Many study have revealed a good correlation , up to the last decade , between century-scale change in global surface temperature and solar activity , though the mechanism is still controversial . Long-term anomaly of atmospheric parameter are often connected to large-scale change in atmospheric circulation influencing , through teleconnections , distant and apparently unconnected area . Such large-scale phenomenon are El Nino/Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) and North Atlantic Oscillation ( NAO ) affecting the climate over a great part of the globe on interannual to decadal and centennial time-scales . Little is known about the factor determining the long-term variability of these phenomenon . In the present paper we compare the century-long variability of NAO and ENSO with the solar activity variation in the secular ( Gleissberg ) solar cycle and find a close relation between them . We suggest that the influence of solar activity on these large-scale phenomenon is mediated by atmospheric center of action which undergo change in intensity and location in response to long-term variation of solar activity .

aVThe concern about global climate change ha heightened the need to understand past climatic variation . Temperature variation during the past thousand of year can be estimated from the relative abundance of fossil of various organism in lake sediment . The past temperature thus reconstructed suggest several period of cooling and warming , and it is important to understand how much of the seeming variation is really statistically significant . The paper proposes an inference approach based on the SiZer method . Several different smooth of the reconstructed temperature are considered simultaneously making possible inference about significant temperature trend at different time scale . The proposed method is applied to temperature reconstruction using a diatom fossil-based data set collected in the Finnish Lapland . The paper also suggests modification and extension to the original SiZer method that the present application call for . ( C ) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All right reserved .

aVMasting , the intermittent production of large flower or seed crop by a population of perennial plant , can enhance the reproductive success of participating plant and drive fluctuation in seed-consumer population and other ecosystem component over large geographic area . The spatial and taxonomic extent over which masting is synchronized can determine it success in enhancing individual plant fitness a well a it ecosystem-level effect , and it can indicate the type of proximal cue , that enable reproductive synchrony . Here , we demonstrate high intra- and intergeneric synchrony in mast seeding by 17 specie of New Zealand plant from four family across > 150 000 km ( 2 ) . The synchronous specie vary ecologically ( pollination and dispersal mode ) and are geographically widely separated , so intergeneric synchrony seems unlikely to be adaptive per se . Synchronous fruiting by these specie wa associated with anomalously high temperature the summer before seedfall , a cue linked with the La Nina phase of El Nino-Southern Oscillation . The lone asynchronous specie appears , , to respond to summer temperature , but with a 2-yr rather than 1-yr time lag . The importance of temperature anomaly a cue for synchronized masting suggests that the timing and intensity of masting may be sensitive to global climate change , with widespread effect on taxonomically disparate plant and animal community .

aVThe frequency of sea surge in Venice ha increased during the 20th century , and the trend ha been particularly pronounced in the last four decade . However , the time series of independent surge event ( i.e . event separated by at least I week ) ha remained nearly stationary during that period . This suggests that , although the sea level rise ( due to global warming and human activity in the region ) is leading to more multiple event , the frequency of meteorological condition that trigger independent event seems to be nearly balancing the effect of sea level change . Such meteorological condition are identified by compositing sea level pressure ( SLP ) and 995 hPa wind during and before independent sea surge event in Venice . The composite analysis show that these correspond to storm orographically induced over the western Mediterranean basin , when an Atlantic synoptic system is perturbed by the Pyrenees and/or the Alps . It is , however , the persistence , intensity and relative position of such storm to the Adriatic Sea that contribute to the optimum condition for the occurrence of flooding in it northern embayment . It is shown that the synoptic picture is translated into persistent low SLP over the Venice region , negative north-south SLP gradient over the Adriatic , and south-southeasterly to southeasterly wind over the central and northern part of the sea . During the 40 year period under analysis , the persistence and intensity of the most adverse scenario for the occurrence of sea surge in Venice have been generally decreasing ; significant trend have been found in the tail of the distribution of Venice SLP , SLP north-south gradient , and of surface wind over the northern Adriatic . It is the balance between these trend and the continuing sea level rise that may account for the near-stationarity of independent sea surge event during the last four decade .

aV[ 1 ] We investigated the relationship between CH4 production and oxidation in two tidal freshwater wetland forest in order to determine whether CH4 oxidation efficiency wa limited by O-2 or CH4 . Methane oxidation wa measured in situ over a 16-month period with bi-monthly application of the inhibitor CH3F . Oxidation consumed 52 +/- 10 and 81 +/- 9 % of diffusive CH4 emission on the two site . Methane oxidation rate were linearly related to gross CH4 emission on both site ( r ( 2 ) = 0.96 ) , demonstrating the process wa CH4-limited . This interpretation is consistent with the fact that the apparent activation energy for the potential CH4 production and oxidation differed by < 4 kJ mol ( -1 ) . Apparent activation energy calculated from field emission data were also similar for the two process . The high CH4 oxidation efficiency on these site may be attributed to relatively low rate of methane production , a deep oxidizing zone ( 5-10 cm ) , and low cover of understory vegetation capable of CH4 transport . If our result are typical of forested wetland , CH4 oxidation efficiency in forested wetland will not change in response to soil warming .

aVA multidisciplinary analysis ( microfacies , sequential stratigraphy and clay mineralogy ) wa made on Frasnian/Famennian ( F/F ) boundary stratum of the Steinbruch Schmidt section in Western Germany . Three major microfacies are recognised . Their succession record a shallowing-upward evolution from deep , quiet and poorly oxygenated environment , below the storm wave base , to environment influenced by Current activity close to the storm wave base . The Kellwasser Horizons correspond to the deepest microfacies . The shallowest microfacies correspond to fine-grained calcareous tempestites or turbidites coming from a distant shelf of northwest Germany . The sequential pattern through the F/F boundary show the succession of seven system tract . Two sequence boundary are located just above the Lower Kellwasser Horizon and at the F/F boundary itself . These are underlined by hardgrounds suggesting time gap . The Kellwasser Horizons correspond to sea-level highstands and the overlying bed record a transition from lowstand to transgressive system tract . Illite , and kaolinite are the dominant clay mineral associated with mixed layer and trace of chlorite . Illite abundance is maximal during Kellwasser Horizons . Illite and kaolinite were probably inherited from a highly weathered source area although part of the illite is diagenetic . Kaolinite is the second most abundant clay mineral and is particularly well represented ( up to 50 % ) between the Kellwasser Horizons . An unusual clay assemblage of illite and mixed layer is associated with a bentonite layer . Kaolinite increase during time when thin tempestites or turbiditic microbioclastic layer come from a distant shelf during sea-level fall . The kaolinite percentage reach it maximum at the top of the lowstand system tract . The high percentage of kaolinite suggests a hot wet climate and could be related to global warming .

aVSince the middle of the nineteenth century the composition of the Earth atmosphere ha begun to change in a manner which is unprecedented over the Quaternary era . The carbon dioxide concentration , for example had been oscillating between extremal value of 180 ppm ( during glaciation ) and 280 ppm ( during interglacial era ) . It had stayed almost constant over the last 10 000 year , but ha now reached a value of 360 ppm , much of the increase taking place during the last decade . Similarly methane concentration ha been multiplied by more than a factor 2 , and other gas ( nitrous oxide ) have also experienced an exponential growth . There is no doubt that this situation is the result of human activity : energy consumption , industrial or agricultural activity , deforestation . As most of these gas have a long residence time in the atmosphere , where they tend to accumulate , we may expect the level of these perturbation to increase strongly throughout the 21st century . To diagnose the possible impact of these trend in term of climate impact , the only available tool are numerical model . These numerical model constitute in a way virtural planet , where the atmospheric and oceanic flow , the continental hydrology , and their interaction , are represented through physical equation . Models are not a perfect representation of the Earth system , and they will never be . We also can not expect the climate system to be fully predictable . But model are strongly constrained by conservation equation , they behave in many aspect like the real planet and reproduce quite realistically the mean geographical and seasonal fluctuation of the precipitation , the temperature or the wind a well a some of the most important natural fluctuation at intraseasonal or interannual ( El Nino , North Atlantic Oscillation ) time scale . So model are useful to describe a range of possible future climate Present projection indicate in all case , a significant change , with a global surface warming in 2 100 between 2degreesC and 6degreesC : half of the uncertainty is due to the economic projection , half is due to the complex behavior of the climate system ( in particular : cloud ) . It is striking that the lower bound of these estimate already represents an important perturbation . The change in temperature would induce change in precipitation rate or area , in storminess or cyclone track - the regional consequence are however difficult to predict in detail . We may expect the sea level to rise from 20 to 90 cm . Changes in a more distant future ( 2 century ) might be much larger , although such projection are le reliable . An important feature of the change to come may be their partially unpredictable character : many of the local event accompanying a global climate change will arise a surprise . In that sense the rate of change will be the primary factor of danger . And if it is probably too late to stop climate modification , there is still time to favor a situation where adaptation to it impact will be easier .

aVThe quantification of carbon ( C ) and nitrogen ( N ) cycling in ecosystem is important for ( a ) understanding change in ecosystem structure and function with change in land use , ( b ) determining the sustainability of ecosystem , and ( c ) balancing the global C budget a it relates to global climate change . A meso-scale study wa conducted to determine regional effect of climate change on C and N cycling within disturbed ecosystem . Objectives of the research were to quantify ( a ) sediment yield , ( b ) current C storage in vegetation and soil , and ( c ) soil C efflux from both abandoned and rehabilitated coal surface-mined land in Ohio . A dynamic model wa developed to simulate sediment yield , grassland production , and C and N cycling on surface-mined land . Evaluation of plant production and soil erosion submodels with data set from surface-mined land in the mid-western U.S. resulted in r ( 2 ) value of 0.99 and 0.97 , respectively . Depending on the initial value of soil organic carbon ( SOC ) , model simulation estimated that unvegetated surface-mined land in Ohio yield approximately 441,325 Mg yr ( -1 ) of sediment and emit between 2,000-20,000 Mg yr ( -1 ) of C to the atmosphere from decomposition of SOC . While rehabilitated land had a higher C efflux rate than barren land , a positive C sequestration rate of 18.4 Mg km ( -2 ) yr ( -1 ) wa estimated a a result of organic matter addition . This sequestion rate increased considerably under projected climate change scenario , while it decreased when simulated rehabilitated grassland were harvested for hay . Changes in land use and cover can cause surface-mined land to be either a net sink or source for C. Successful rehabilitation of mined land can decrease erosion and promote soil C sequestration , while at the same time providing additional land for the management of natural resource .

aVThe dynamic of the forest at the ecotone of the boreal forest and temperate forest in Northeast China were simulated using the adapted gap model BKPF under global climatic change ( GFDL scenario ) and doubled CO2 concentration at 50 year in the future . The response of tree specie and specie with similar biological characteristic under global climate change and double CO2 concentration were based on biophysical limit of the tree specie in the area and their biological competition . The result showed that after 50 year the stand density and LAI ( leaf area index ) of the forest growing from a clear-cut would not be significantly different from those under current condition . Stand productivity would increase about 7 % , and stand aboveground biomass would increase 15 % . However , the stand density of the current mature forest would be reduced by more than 20 % . The stand would be dominated by Quercus mongolica Fisch. , Populus davidiana Dode. , Betula spp . and other broadleaved tree specie , and Quercus mongolica would account for about 50 % of the total density . The stand biomass would be reduced by more than 90 % . Quercus mongolica would comprise about 57 % of the total stand biomass . The stand productivity would not change significantly , but it would be comprised mainly of Quercus mongolica , Populus davidiana , Betula spp . The current stand height would decrease slightly . The stand LAI would decline dramatically , moreover , Quercus mongolica would comprise about 50 % of the stand LAI .

aVThe high degree of habitat heterogeneity and habitat fragmentation in arctic ecosystem may support a high genotypic and ecotypic variability . This may buffer the survival of plant specie threatened by global climate change , which affect the Arctic more strongly than other ecosystem . Here , we assessed if two morphotypes of Polygonum viviparum ( characterised by different colour of their bulbil ) differ in their abundance along a snowmelt gradient , if their biomass allocation pattern are influenced differentially by environmental variable , and if the temperature dependency of bulbil germination differs between morphotypes . We found slight difference in the effect of timing of snowmelt on abundance of the morphotypes , which seem to have little ecological relevance . Total biomass and biomass allocation were similar between morphotypes and were negatively correlated with soil-water content . Bulbil germination ( the onset of growth of the bulbil ) wa assessed over a temperature range from 2 to 25 C and result indicate an earlier ( maximum of 5 day ) `` germination '' of one morphotype , but final bulbil germination ( > 80 % ) and bulbil-germination rate were similar for both type . Bulbil germination wa weakly temperature dependent , with faster emergence at higher temperature . Overall , our result could provide no convincing evidence for difference between the two examined morphotypes that could be of ecological relevance with respect to anticipated climate change in the Arctic .

aVIt ha been predicted that in the coming decade the global climate will get warmer and in some region dryer . Global warming may influence the genetic structure of forest tree population . This paper present a simulation study on possible effect of an increasing annual mean temperature and decreasing precipitation during the growing season on the genetic structure characterised by inventory of six isozyme gene locus in provenance trial of Norway spruce ( Pirea abies ( L. ) Karst. ) . The data for parameterising the model were taken from a trial on 25-year-old Norway spruce . From the data a virtual stand wa generated to simulate growth over a period of 75 year at seven site with varying environmental condition . The tree growth simulator SILVA 2.2 wa run with two scenario ( I. natural mortality only ; II . natural mortality and thinning from above ) . The result of the simulation run were linked with the isozyme data of the tree a investigated in the tree that were selected for generating the virtual population . In the simulated population at the age of 100 allele and genotype frequency were determined . Based on the isozyme data calculation of various measure of genetic multiplicity , heterozygosity , genetic diversity , and genetic differentiation were performed for each simulation run . At the age of 100 year three growth parameter , how large differentiation between site . Such a separation can not be found for the genetic parameter a assessed by isozyme gene marker . However , most of the eight genetic parameter differ between site . Significant difference arc calculated for four genetic parameter in scenario I and for six genetic parameter in scenario II . This result obtained by a new approach , call for additional study where more initial population with different characteristic are tested in various scenario and with different type of marker .

aVMicrobial production in anoxic wetland rice soil is a major source of atmospheric CH4 , the most important non-CO2 greenhouse gas . Much higher CH4 emission from well managed irrigated rice field in the wet than in the dry season could not be explained by seasonal difference in temperature . We hypothesized that high CH4 emission in the wet season are caused by low grain to biomass ratio . In a screenhouse experiment , removing spikelet to reduce the plant ' capacity to store photosynthetically fixed C in grain increased CH4 emission , presumably via extra C input to the soil . Unfavorable condition for spikelet formation in the wet season may similarly explain high methane emission . The observed relationship between reduced grain filling and CH4 emission provides opportunity to mitigate CH4 emission by optimizing rice productivity .

aVDepleting oil and gas reserve , combined with the growing concern of global warming , have made it inevitable to seek alternative/renewable energy source . The integration of renewables such a solar and wind energy is becoming increasingly attractive and is being used widely , for substitution of oil-produced energy , and eventually to minimize atmospheric degradation . The literature show that commercial/residential building in Saudi Arabia consume an estimated 10-40 % of the total electric energy generated . In the present investigation , hourly wind-speed and solar radiation measurement made at the solar radiation and meteorological monitoring station , Dhahran ( 26degrees32 ' N , 50degrees13 ' E ) , Saudi Arabia , have been analyzed to investigate the feasibility of using hybrid ( wind+solar+diesel ) energy conversion system at Dhahran to meet the energy need of twenty 2-bedroom house . The monthly average wind speed for Dhahran range from 4,1 to 6.4 m/s . The monthly average daily value of solar radiation for Dhahran range from 3.6 kWh/m ( 2 ) to 7.96 kWh/m ( 2 ) . The performance of hybrid system consisting of different rated power wind farm , photovoltaic ( PV ) area , and storage capacity together with a diesel back-up are presented . The monthly average daily energy generated from the above hybrid system configuration ha been presented . The deficit energy generated from the back-up diesel generator and the number of operational hour of the diesel system to meet a specific annual electrical energy demand of 702,358 kWh have also been presented .

aVWe explore in this paper how animal can be affected by variation in climate , topography , vegetation characteristic , and body size . We utilize new spatially explicit state-of-the-art model that incorporate principle from heat and mass transfer engineering , physiology , morphology , and behavior that have been modified to provide spatially explicit hypothesis using GIS . We demonstrate how temporal and spatial change in microclimate resulting from difference in topography and vegetation cover alter animal energetics , and behavior . We explore the impact of these energetic prediction on elk energetics in burned and unburned stand of conifer in winter in Yellowstone National Park , chuckwalla lizard distribution limit in North America , California Beechey Ground squirrel and Dusky Footed woodrat mass and energy requirement and activity pattern on the landscape , their predator prey interaction with a rattlesnake , Crotalus viridis , and shift in that food web structure due to topographic and vegetative variation . We illustrate how different scale of data/observation provide different piece of information that may collectively define the real distribution of a specie . We then use sensitivity analysis of energetic model to evaluate hypothesis about the effect of change in core temperature ( fever ) global climate ( increased air temperature under a global warming scenario ) and vegetation cover ( deforestation ) on winter survival of elk , the geographic distribution of chuckwalla and the activity overlap of predator and prey specie within a subset of commonly observed specie in a terrestrial food web . Variation in slope and aspect affect the spatial variance in solar radiation incident on the ground , hence ground surface temperature , at the same elevation , same hourly 2 m air temperature , and wind speed . We illustrate visually how spatial effect and landscape heterogeneity make statistical description of animal response problematic , since multiple distribution of their response to climate , topography , and vegetation on the landscape can yield the same descriptive statistic , especially at high ( 30 m ) resolution . This preliminary analysis suggests that the model ha far-reaching implication for hypothesis testing in ecology at a variety of spatial and temporal scale .

aVThe debate on climate change and anthropogenic influence on climate ha a long history , which involves more than just scientific finding and meteorological observation . In this paper , the question of how the scientific concept of climate change ha been communicated to the public , in the past and at present is studied using picture and historical analysis . Publications popularising climate change today are sometimes illustrated with picture showing palm tree and glacier together in one scene . This is nothing new : the motif of palm tree and glacier wa used for the same purpose early in the 20th century . Several example of such illustration are presented and discussed in a historical context . The basic meaning of such picture is that palm stand for warm climate and glacier for coldness , and both together signify climatic change . The use of this motif to illustrate climate change originates in the popularisation of the theory of ice age and climate in Earth 's history , which took place towards the end of the 19th century . At about the same time , the motif of palm and glacier wa also used in tourist advertisement for certain alpine destination . In this case , the motif stand for the variety of the alpine landscape , which offer spectacular high-mountain scenery and exotic flora close to each other . It is suggested that the use of this motif to illustrate climate change in the early 20th century express an ambivalence towards climate change , consisting of age-old concern about extreme of climate on the one hand and tourist illusion of a warm climate on the other . Towards the end of the 20th century , the motif appears in context with the popularisation of the concept of anthropogenic global warming . The ambivalence ha given rise to a clear negative value judgement . Today , photo of recent extreme weather event are used more often than palm tree and glacier to illustrate climate change .

aV[ 1 ] California 's primary hydrologic system , the San Francisco estuary and it upstream watershed , is vulnerable to the regional hydrologic consequence of projected global climate change . Projected temperature anomaly from a global climate model are used to drive a combined model of watershed hydrology and estuarine dynamic . By 2090 , a projected temperature increase of 2.1degreesC result in a loss of about half of the average April snowpack storage , with greatest loss in the northern headwater . Consequently , spring runoff is reduced by 5.6 km ( 3 ) ( similar to20 % of historical annual runoff ) , with associated increase in winter flood peak . The smaller spring flow yield spring/summer salinity increase of up to 9 psu , with larger increase in wet year .

aVThere is need to map indicator of biodiversity such a specie richness and abundance of individual in order to predict where specie loss is occurring . Species richness and abundance have been hypothesized to increase with ecosystem productivity . Moreover , productivity of ecosystem varies in space and time , and this heterogeneity is also hypothesized to influence specie richness and abundance of individual . Ecosystem productivity may be estimated using remotely sensed data , and researcher have specifically proposed the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ( AVHRR-NDVI ) . Interannual average NDVI and it variability ( standard deviation ) were correlated with large mammal specie richness and abundance of individual at a landscape scale in Kenya . The biodiversity indicator associated negatively with interannual average NDVI and positively with variability of NDVI . Understanding these relationship can help in estimating change in mammalian specie richness and abundance in response to global climate change .

aVMangroves , the only woody halophyte living at the confluence of land and sea , have been heavily used traditionally for food , timber , fuel and medicine , and presently occupy about 181 000 km ( 2 ) of tropical and subtropical coastline . Over the past 50 year , approximately one-third of the world 's mangrove forest have been lost , but most data show very variable loss rate and there is considerable margin of error in most estimate . Mangroves are a valuable ecological and economic resource , being important nursery ground and breeding site for bird , fish , crustacean , shellfish , reptile and mammal ; a renewable source of wood ; accumulation site for sediment , contaminant , carbon and nutrient ; and offer protection against coastal erosion . The destruction of mangrove is usually positively related to human population density . Major reason for destruction are urban development , aquaculture , mining and overexploitation for timber , fish , crustacean and shellfish . Over the next 25 year , unrestricted clear felling , aquaculture , and overexploitation of fishery will be the greatest threat , with lesser problem being alteration of hydrology , pollution and global warming . Loss of biodiversity is , and will continue to be , a severe problem a even pristine mangrove are species-poor compared with other tropical ecosystem . The future is not entirely bleak . The number of rehabilitation and restoration project is increasing worldwide with some country showing increase in mangrove area . The intensity of coastal aquaculture appears to have levelled off in some part of the world . Some commercial project and . economic model indicate that mangrove can be used a a sustainable resource , especially for wood . The brightest note is that the rate of population growth is projected to slow during the next 50 year , with a gradual decline thereafter to the end of the century . Mangrove forest will continue to be exploited at current rate to 2025 , unless they are seen a a valuable resource to be managed on a sustainable basis . After 2025 , the future of mangrove will depend on technological and ecological advance in multi-species silviculture , genetics , and forestry modelling , but the greatest hope for their future is for a reduction in human population growth .

aVThe recent increase in the frequency of coastal flooding in Venice mainly depends on loss of land elevation ( subsidence and eustasy ) and man-induced hydrodynamic change in the lagoon area , but can also be strengthened in the near future by change in climate . In this paper , after a short review of recent change in the relative mean and maximal level of the sea and their cause , the main meteorological factor ( atmospheric pressure and wind of sirocco and bora ) , which produce sea surge in the Gulf of Venice , are identified statistically . The recent evolution of these meteorological factor in the Adriatic area show some favorable trend ( the atmospheric pressure is increasing , thus provisionally masking eustatic sea-level rise , and bora is sharply lessening ) . However , the effect of sirocco , which is increasing in frequency in the mid-Adriatic , seem to be prevailing . On the whole , the frequency of sea surge greater than or equal to5 cm to greater than or equal to30 cm , which are the most frequent , is increasing in the North Adriatic and this implies more `` moderately high tide level '' , which are however liable to flood the lowest part of the city of Venice . Such increase in frequency seems related to recent climatic change ( possibly related to global warming ) and may therefore be expected to worsen in the near future .

aVThe objective of this study is to evaluate the potential for recovering fluorocarbon a measure for the abatement of global warming . In this study . we focused on the three different kind of fluorocarbon : CFCs . HCFCs and HFCs . and targeted refrigerant use because of the availability of relevant data . We first estimated future fluorocarbon emission from the targeted appliance : we next compared those emission in the unit of CO2 equivalent to the level of CO2 emission in 1990 from a quantitative point of view . As the result of this study , it wa found that fluorocarbon emission in 1999 and 2010 would be equal to approximately 7 and 3 % of the level of CO2 emission in 1990 respectively . Moreover . if we implement a 100 % recovery rate in every recovery route , we can reduce a large amount of emission which correspond to approximately 2-5 % of the level of CO2 emission in 1990 , even if we take into account the enery-related CO2 emission by the transportation and decomposition of fluorocarbon .

aV[ 1 ] The influence of contrail on the radiation budget depends mainly on their coverage and optical depth . This study derives these parameter from data of the advanced very high resolution radiometer sensor onboard the NOAA 14 satellite for a region over western Europe within 40degrees-56degrees N and 10degreesW-23degrees E during 2 year starting March 1995 . The data are classified by an operational contrail detection algorithm with a new evaluation of the detection efficiency . From the classification result , daytime and nighttime coverage by line-shaped contrail over western Europe are derived . The daytime contrail coverage for the analyzed region is 0.7 % in the annual mean , 1.0 % during winter , and 0.4 % during summer . The daytime contrail cover is 3 time higher than the night-time contrail cover . An effective optical depth of the observed contrail is derived from the radiation contrast in the 11 m m channel for contrail and adjacent pixel . The optical depth in the visible spectral range is computed from these result assuming a previously measured size spectrum of ice crystal . The mean visible optical depth is found to be about 0.1 , much smaller than that derived from previous case study . The average radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere is computed for the derived contrail cloud cover and optical depth . Here contrail mostly cause positive radiative forcing ( heating ) . Larger heating effect during night and summer get partly compensated through more contrail cover during day and winter . The radiative forcing by contrail in the examined region is similar to0.03 W m ( -2 ) , which is much smaller than wa estimated earlier .

aVThis study investigates the regional response of a climate model to the gradual increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide at 1 % per year compounded for quadrupling . Use of NCAR fully coupled Climate System Model ( CSM1.2 ) is attempted , with special emphasis on the simulated sea-level change in the neighbouring sea of the northwestern Pacific Ocean with an enhanced resolution . Regional warming and sea level change are higher than global change . At the time Of CO2 quadrupling , the model predicts a rise in sea level of 19 cm and 25 cm for the globe and the northwestern Pacific Ocean , respectively , while surface air temperature rise are 2.9degreesC and 3.0degreesC for the globe and the northwestern Pacific Ocean , respectively . Based on simulation , climate change in the Northwestern Pacific Ocean will be more distinctive compared with the global average , mainly due to exceptionally large warming and sea level change near the entrance of the Kuroshio extension .

aVUsing data from the contiguous USA , the relationship between mean and standard deviation of daily air temperature wa estimated on a monthly timescale from 1948 to 1997 . In general , there is either an inverse relationship or a weak relationship between mean and standard deviation . For both daily maximum and daily minimum air temperature , the inverse relationship is spatially coherent for one-third to two-thirds of the contiguous USA for most month . The inverse relationship also is fairly strong , with typical reduction in standard deviation ranging from 0.2 to 0.5degreesC for every 1degreesC increase in mean temperature . A weaker , direct relationship between mean and standard deviation occurs ; in some northern state , primarily during spring and fall month . Using the predominant inverse and weak relationship a historical analog for future climatic change suggests that interdiurnal variability of air temperature should either decrease or remain unchanged under warming condition . Although the variability of air temperature may decrease or remain unchanged at most location in the contiguous USA , the probability of extremely high air temperature should still increase , depending on the magnitude of change in mean air temperature and the nature of the variance response .

aVThis paper outline the growing need for energy in the developed and developing country and the acute population growth , which will exceed 10 billion by the year 2050 . It describes the achievement and progress made in hydropower , biomass conversion , geothermal , solar thermal technology , wind energy conversion , and the increasing usage of photovoltaics . The paper also address the barrier and problem facing renewable energy user and producer . It is evident that global warming is setting in and is going to change the climate a well a the terrain of many country unless drastic measure are taken . The recent Kyoto meeting emphasized the importance of limiting CO2 emission and abiding by some form of agreement to reduce emission . The present study concludes that renewable energy penetration into the energy market is much faster than wa expected in recent year and by 2030 , 15-20 % of our prime energy will be met by renewable energy .

aVWe examined the response of an allergenic specie , western ragweed ( Ambrosia psilostachya DC . ) , to experimental warming and clipping . The experiment wa conducted in a tallgrass prairie in Oklahoma , USA , between 1999 and 2001 . Warming increased ragweed stem by 88 % when not clipped and 46 % when clipped . Clipping increased ragweed stem by 75 % and 36 % in the control and warmed plot , respectively . In 2001 , warming resulted in a 105 % increase in ragweed aboveground biomass ( AGB ) , and the ratio of ragweed AGB to total AGB increased by 79 % . Dry mass per ragweed stem in the warmed plot wa 37 % and 38 % greater than that in the control plot in 2000 and 2001 , respectively . Although warming caused no difference in pollen production per stem , total pollen production increased by 84 % ( P < 0.05 ) because there were more ragweed stem . Experimental warming significantly increased pollen diameter from 21.2 & mu ; m in the control plot to 23.9 & mu ; m in the warmed plot ( a 13 % increase ) . The result from our experiment suggest that global warming could aggravate allergic hazard and thereby jeopardize public health .

aVDuring the negotiation on the Kyoto Protocol , Brazil proposed a methodology to link the relative contribution of Annex I Parties to emission reduction with the relative contribution of Parties to the global-mean temperature increase . The proposal wa not adopted during the negotiation but referred to the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice for consideration of it methodological aspect . In this context we analyze the impact of model uncertainty and methodological choice on the regionally attributed global-mean temperature increase . A climate assessment model ha been developed to calculate change in greenhouse gas concentration , global-mean temperature and sea-level rise attributable to individual region . The analysis show the impact of the different choice in methodological aspect to be a important a the impact of model uncertainty on a region 's contribution to present and future global temperature increase . Choices may be the inclusion of the anthropogenic non-CO2 greenhouse gas emission and/or the CO2 emission associated with land-use change . When responsibility to global temperature change is attributed to all emitting Parties , the impact of modeling uncertainty and methodological choice on contribution of individual Parties are considerable . However , if relative contribution are calculated only within the group of Annex I country , the result are le sensitive to the uncertainty aspect considered here .

aVTemperature projection for the 21st century made in the Third Assessment Report ( TAR ) of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) indicate a rise of 1.4 to 5.8degreesC for 1990-2100 . However , several independent line of evidence suggest that the projection at the upper end of this range are not well supported . Since the publication of the TAR , several finding have appeared in the scientific literature that challenge many of the assumption that generated the TAR temperature range . Incorporating new finding on the radiative forcing of black carbon ( BC ) aerosol , the magnitude of the climate sensitivity , and the strength of the climate/carbon cycle feedback into a simple upwelling diffusion/energy balance model similar to the one that wa used in the TAR , we find that the range of projected warming for the 1990-2100 period is reduced to 1.1-2.8degreesC . When we adjust the TAR emission scenario to include an atmospheric CO2 pathway that is based upon observed CO2 increase during the past 25 yr , we find a warming range of 1.5-2.6degreesC prior to the adjustment for the new finding . Factoring in these finding along with the adjusted CO2 pathway reduces the range to 1.0-1.6degreesC . And thirdly , a simple empirical adjustment to the average of a large family of model , based upon observed change in temperature , yield a warming range of 1.3-3.0degreesC , with a central value of 1.9degreesC . The constancy of these somewhat independent result encourages u to conclude that 21st century warming will be modest and near the low end of the IPCC TAR projection .

aVThe available evidence for thermal modulation of neurolipofuscin deposition in poikilotherm is reviewed here and additional data are contributed . Mainly decapod crustacean model are employed and neurolipofuscin is treated a an index of physiological aging . In all case , neurolipofuscin accumulation rate is positively correlated with environmental temperature but there appears to be lowered sensitivity in the thermal mid-range , an 'optimum ' temperature for neurolipofuscin accumulation and possibly age-associated variation . The geographical position of the population within the specie ' thermal range may determine sensitivity of the response . There is seasonal oscillation of neurolipofuscin accumulation rate , providing preliminary evidence for neurolipofuscin turnover with net loss in winter . Spatial and temporal thermal variation of similar magnitude appear to have comparable effect on neurolipofuscin accumulation rate . Such effect may be extreme , suggesting important implication for physiological aging even in homeotherm . Inter-specific comparison indicate that species-specific neurolipofuscin accumulation rate are positively correlated with habitat temperature and inversely correlated with maximum lifespan and age at maturity . These finding help explain some well-known bioclimatic trend in maturation- and maximum body size , such a Bergmann 's rule . They also highlight the fact that global warming is likely to cause significant change in life history parameter , population dynamic and response to exploitation for many specie .

aV[ 1 ] Despite the importance of methane for climate , it ha remained difficult to measure gross rate of methane production and consumption without inducing artifact . To remedy this , we have developed , tested , and applied a field-based ( CH4 ) -C-13 pool dilution technique . Laboratory test , sensitivity analysis , and field data indicate that this technique is robust for measuring gross rate of methane production and consumption . In our analysis of 130 soil core from 17 field site of differing environmental condition , we encountered a wide range of gross methane production rate ( 0.04-930 mg CH4-C m ( -2 ) day ( -1 ) ) , but encountered a narrower range of consumption rate ( 0.1-9.2 mg CH4-C m ( -2 ) day ( -1 ) ) . Unexpectedly , we found that gross production of methane wa common ( mean = 0.15 mg CH4-C m ( -2 ) day ( -1 ) ) even in dry , oxic soil where average soil condition can not support methane producer . Through improved measurement of methane turnover in soil , this technique can offer a more fine-grained understanding of how productive and consumptive process are linked to soil-atmosphere trace gas balance .

aVUrban shade tree offer significant benefit in reducing building air-conditioning demand and improving urban air quality by reducing smog . The saving associated with these benefit vary by climate region and can be up to $ 200 per tree . The cost of planting tree and maintaining them can vary from $ 10 to $ 500 per tree . Tree-planting program can be designed to have lower cost so that they offer potential saving to community that plant tree . Our calculation suggest that urban tree play a major role in sequestering CO , and thereby delay global warming . We estimate that a tree planted in Los Angeles avoids the combustion of 18 kg of carbon annually , even though it sequesters only 4.5-11 kg ( a it would if growing in a forest ) . In this sense , one shade tree in Los Angeles is equivalent to three to five forest tree . In a recent analysis for Baton Rouge , Sacramento , and Salt Lake City , we estimated that planting an average of four shade tree per house ( each with a top view cross section of 50 m ( 2 ) ) would lead to an annual reduction in carbon emission from power plant of 16,000 , 41,000 , and 9000 t , respectively ( the per-tree reduction in carbon emission is about 10-11 kg per year ) . These reduction only account for the direct reduction in the net cooling- and heating-energy use of building . Once the impact of the community cooling is included , these saving are increased by at least 25 % . ( C ) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All right reserved .

aVGlobal climate change may impact wildlife population by affecting local weather pattern , which , in turn , can impact a variety of ecological process . However , it is not clear that local variation in ecological process can be explained by large-scale pattern of climate . The North Atlantic oscillation ( NAO ) is a large-scale climate phenomenon that ha been shown to influence the population dynamic of some animal . Although effect of the NAO on vertebrate population dynamic have been studied , it remains uncertain whether it broadly predicts the impact of weather on specie . We examined the ability of local weather data and the NAO to explain the annual variation in population . dynamic of white-tailed ptarmigan ( Lagopus leucurus ) in Rocky Mountain National Park , USA . We performed canonical correlation analysis on the demographic subspace of ptarmigan and local-climate subspace defined by the empirical orthogonal function ( EOF ) using data from 1975 to 1999 . We found that two subspace were significantly correlated on the first canonical variable . The Pearson correlation coefficient of the first EOF value of the demographic and local-climate subspace wa significant . The population density and the first EOF of local-climate subspace influenced the ptarmigan population with 1-year lag in the Gompertz model . However , the NAO index wa neither related to the first two EOF of local-climate subspace nor to the first EOF of the demographic subspace of ptarmigan . Moreover , the NAO index wa not a significant term in the Gompertz model for the ptarmigan population . Therefore , local climate had stronger signature on the demography of ptarmigan than did a large-scale index , i.e. , the NAO index . We conclude that local response of wildlife population to changing climate may not be adequately explained by model that project large-scale climatic pattern .

aVAn environmentally benign etching process using a solid material evaporation technique ha been investigated for preventing global warming . In this process , a polytetrafluoroethylene is evaporated by a CO2 laser , resulting in production of fluorocarbon specie working a the etching specie . Therefore , this system employ no perfluorocompound feed gas , which cause global warming , and enables u to design a new plasma chemistry using the solid material . The system wa successfully applied to a SiO2 contact hole etching process employing a planar electron cyclotron resonance plasma . The etched profile wa successfully controlled by varying the Ar dilution ratio and the process pressure . In a 0.6 mum contact hole and a 0.08 mum trench fabrication process , this novel process enables u to realize high etching performance , where the etching rate Of SiO2 , selectivity of SiO2/resist , and SiO2/Si were 340 nm/min , 6.8 and 31 , respectively , in optimal condition . To clarify the plasma chemistry using solid material evaporation , CFx ( x = 1-3 ) radical density and F atom density were measured by infrared diode laser absorption spectroscopy and actinometric optical emission spectroscopy , and fluorocarbon film deposited on SiO2 were analyzed by x-ray . photoelectron spectroscopy . On the basis of these result , the etching mechanism wa discussed . ( C ) 2002 American Vacuum Society .

aVThis paper describes current trend in solar-powered air conditioning , which ha seen renewed interest in recent year due to the growing awareness of global warming and other environmental problem . Closed-cycle heat-powered cooling device are based mainly on absorption chiller , a proven technology employing LiBr-water a the working fluid pair . Recent development in gas-fired system of this type make available double- and triple-effect chiller with considerably higher COP than their single-effect counterpart , which make it possible to reduce the amount of solar heat required per kW of cooling . These system require , however , high-temperature solar collector . The principle of multi-staging absorption system are described . An economic comparison is provided which show the total system cost to be dominated by the solar part of the system . At current price , the high COP , high temperature alternative is still more costly than the low temperature one . Open-cycle desiccant system employing either solid or liquid sorbent are described . While the main thrust in research on novel closed-cycle absorption system ha been toward increasing the operating temperature in order to improve efficiency through multi-staging , open-cycle absorption and desiccant system have been developed for use with low temperature heat source such a flat plate solar collector . A novel open-cycle ( DER ) system is described , which make it possible to use the solar heat at relatively low temperature , for producing both chilled water and cold , dehumidified air in variable quantity , a required by the load .

aVGlobal climate change may affect the upper elevational limit of distribution of montane organism , especially if those limit are set directly by temperature . Oviparous ( egg-laying ) reptile are constrained in this way because of their nesting requirement . In many area , deforestation ha already subjected these animal to small-scale `` climate change . '' Clearing for power line ( hydrocuts ) increase solar radiation to potential nest site , and hence enables these animal to penetrate higher into montane area than would otherwise be possible . Such small-scale anthropogenic `` warming '' may offer a useful model system to explore consequence of broader climate change on the distribution and biology of montane organism . We quantified thermal effect of a hydrocut in montane eucalypt forest in the Brindabella Range of southeastern Australia . The reduced canopy cover , increased duration of sunlight exposure , and higher level of incident radiation in cleared area substantially modified thermal regime in potential nest site . Orientation and exposure were the most important determinant of nest temperature and predicted the distribution of natural nest . Such cleared corridor ( for road , power line , ski run , etc . ) may not only extend the upper elevational limit for oviparous reptile , but may also modify the genetic structure and demography of population .

aVThis summary and update of information on the marine bird of the southeastern Beaufort Sea is intended to support discussion on how to improve management of marine resource in the Canadian Beaufort Sea region . Perhaps the most outstanding use of the Beaufort Sea by marine bird is the staging during spring migration by hundred of thousand of eider and long-tailed duck in the earl open water off Cape Bathurst and Banks Island . During midsummer , ten of thousand of long-tailed duck , scoter , scaup , and merganser moult in the sheltered bay and behind barrier beach and spit . Although several specie of goose , duck , loon , gull , and tern nest on island and in wetland along the Beaufort Sea coast , this region ha relatively few nesting seabird compared to eastern Arctic Canada and the Bering Sea . Two possible reason for this are a shortage of cliff suitable for nesting and a lack of pelagic fish . The five most common sea duck specie that occur in the region , long-tailed duck , king eider , common eider , surf scoter , and white-winged scoter , have all declined in number since the mid-1970s . Western Arctic brant population have also declined , although their status within the Beaufort Sea region is unclear . Brant and king eider are the only marine bird specie harvested there in substantial number . Other threat to Beaufort Sea marine bird population include oil spill , global warming , coastal development , and contaminant . Certain threat can be managed at a. local level since they are a result of local economic development , but others , such a global warming or loss of critical wintering area , stem from environmental problem outside the region . Solving these issue will require mutual understanding and commitment on the part of numerous country .

aVLarge piece of standing or fallen dead wood , known a coarse woody debris ( CWD ) , play important role in temperate forest carbon and nutrient cycle , and affect the abundance and distribution of many class of organism . CWD biomass and input are poorly documented in tropical rain forest ( TRF ) , and the cause for their variation at landscape-scales in this biome have not been studied . We quantified standing and fallen CWD stock and input in upland ( non-swamp ) old-growth TRF at the La Selva Biological Station , Costa Rica . We used a network of 18 0.5 ha plot sited in three edaphic condition to analyze soil nutrient effect on CWD stock and input controlling for topography , and to examine topographic effect controlling for soil nutrient . The edaphic condition were flat inceptisols . flat ultisols , and steep ultisols . Chemical analysis confirmed the existence of an almost three-fold gradient in total P and K in the upper I m of soil . We also annually censused all live woody stem greater than or equal to10 cm diameter above buttress in each plot in September/October from 1997 to 2000 to obtain data on stand structure and dynamic . Fallen CWD stock averaged 46.3 Mg ha ( -1 ) ( 22.3 Mg C ha ( -1 ) ) , while standing CWD averaged 6.5 Mg ha ( -1 ) ( 3.1 Mg C ha ( -1 ) ) . There were no significant difference in volume or mass of standing or fallen CWD among edaphic condition . Annual input of CWD averaged 4.9 Mg ha ( -1 ) ( 2.4 Mg C ha ( -1 ) ) . Tumover time of fallen CWD wa ca . 9 year . Neither stock nor input were correlated with stand structure ( number of tree per plot , plot basal area , or plot estimated above-ground biomass ) . Potential difference in CWD stock and input among site with different edaphic condition may have been obscured by a 10-fold variation in tree mortality among plot and a two-fold variation in mean CWD input among year . Analysis of sample variance showed that stock of CWD were adequately sampled with the 18 0.5 ha plot design . but that input were measured with low precision . At La Selva fallen and standing CWD stock together equaled ca . 33 % of estimated above-ground live woody biomass . Tropical rain forest CWD and it associated carbon are intermediate in pool size and turnover rate between fine litter and live tree . Our result show that scaling up TRF CWD estimate to larger spatial scale may be more constrained by the quality of data obtained over single landscape than by variation due to zonal soil nutrient and topographic condition . Both the magnitude and vagility of TRF CWD pool are likely to change with global climate change , but the overall direction of change is uncertain . ( C ) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

aVIn recent year , worldwide concern over global warming ha been expressed . It ha been reported that domestic wastewater and it treatment process are source of CH4 and N2O , designated a greenhouse gas , the reduction of which wa noted to be extremely important at the Third Conference of the Framework Convention on Climate Change ( Conference Of the Parties ; COP3 ) . Here we report a study of a field that ha been unexplored until now : analytical evaluation of the property of the emission of CH4 and N2O and method of restricting their emission in soil-trench wastewater treatment process , the use of which is spreading , mainly in developing nation . The result have provided the following information . A field fact-finding survey ha confirmed that soil trench emit 9.3-13.9 g CH4 m ( -3 ) and 8.2-12.2 gN ( 2 ) O m ( -3 ) in Japan , and 3.0-4.5 g CH4 m ( -3 ) and 3.3-5.0 g N2O m ( -3 ) in China . The emission property widely vary according to the structure of the treatment system . The conversion ratio for nitrogen in the wastewater influent to N2O by a soil trench is between 2 and a maximum of 8 % , and range from a few- to several 10-fold a much a that with the activated sludge method , suggesting that this can be a large source of N2O emission . It ha also clearly been shown that the aerobic-anaerobic state inside the treatment system is closely related to it CH4 and N2O emission characteristic . By performing ventilation to maintain the oxidation-reduction potential ( ORP ) near the trench at an aerobic condition of +200 mV or more , the quantity of CH4 and N2O emitted can be reduced by a much a 50 % from the level without this ventilation , and that this can make a large contribution .

aVEarlier GCM study have expressed the concern that an enhancement of greenhouse warming might increase the occurrence of summer drought in mid-latitudes , especially in southern Europe and central North America . This could represent a severe threat for agriculture in the region concerned , where summer is the main growing season . These prediction must however be considered a uncertain , since most study featuring enhanced summer dryness in mid-latitudes use very simple representation of the land-surface process ( `` bucket '' model ) , despite their key importance for the issue considered . The current study us a regional climate model including a land-surface scheme of intermediate complexity to investigate the sensitivity of the summer climate to enhanced greenhouse warming over the American Midwest . A surrogate climate change scenario is used for the simulation of a warmer climate . The control run are driven at the lateral boundary and the sea surface by reanalysis data and observation , respectively . The warmer climate experiment are forced by a modified set of initial and lateral boundary condition . The modification consist of a uniform 3 K temperature increase and an attendant increase of specific humidity ( unchanged relative humidity ) . This strategy maintains a similar dynamical forcing in the warmer climate experiment , thus allowing to investigate thermodynamical impact of climate change in comparative isolation . The atmospheric CO2 concentration of the sensitivity experiment is set to four time it pre-industrial value . The simulation are conducted from March 15 to October 1st , for 4 year corresponding to drought ( 1988 ) , normal ( 1986 , 1990 ) and flood ( 1993 ) condition . The numerical experiment do not present any great enhancement of summer drying under warmer climatic condition . First , the overall change in the hydrological cycle ( especially evapotranspiration ) are of small magnitude despite the strong forcing applied . Second , precipitation increase in spring lead to higher soil water recharge during this season , compensating for the enhanced soil moisture depletion occurring later in the year . Additional simulation replacing the plant control on transpiration with a bucket-type formulation presented increased soil drying in 1988 , the drought year . This suggests that vegetation control on transpiration might play an important part in counteracting an enhancement of summer drying when soil water get limited . Though further aspect of this issue would need investigating , our result underline the importance of land-surface process in climate integration and suggest that the risk of enhanced summer dryness in the region studied might be le acute than previously assumed , provided the North American general circulation doe not change markedly with global warming .

aVThe word `` sustainability '' and `` sustainable development '' are virtually omnipresent now . But how do we actually achieve the goal of sustainability , and what action can we take ? Green Chemistry and Engineering technology are providing innovative solution for today and tomorrow in many area of product and process research and application . These technology are helping to address some of the world 's most pressing environmental issue , which include global climate change , sustainable energy production , food production and the associated agricultural practice , depletion of non-renewable resource , and the dissipation of toxic and hazardous material in the environment . We describe the essential nature of Green Chemistry and Engineering in meeting these challenge and describe the specific example and case study that are presented in this book .

aVNonlinearity is a salient feature in all complex system , and it certainly characterizes biogeochemical cycle in ecosystem across a wide range of scale . Soil carbon emission is a major source of uncertainty in estimating the terrestrial carbon budget at the ecosystem level and above . Due to the lack of consideration of the nonlinearity in temperature sensitivity of soil respiration , several commonly used ecosystem model produce substantially different estimate of soil respiration with the same or similar model input . In this paper we demonstrated that the response of soil respiration to change in temperature sensitivity is nonlinear and . thus , that the oversimplified formulation may significantly reduce the accuracy of ecosystem model in predicting carbon flux . To alleviate this problem , we have developed a general model of temperature sensitivity of soil respiration that explicitly considers this nonlinearity . The model wa supported by our field measurement from a forest ecosystem , and used to ass the uncertainty in estimating the soil CO2 efflux with several commonly used ecosystem model . Our result indicated that the variation and nonlinearity of the soil respiration-temperature relationship and it dependence on moisture may have important implication for ecosystem carbon modeling at regional and global scale . In other word , 'small cause ' may lead to 'large effect ' in complex ecosystem in term of carbon dynamic . In particular , when the variability in temperature sensitivity of soil respiration wa incorporated in the several commonly used ecosystem model , the carbon source-sink relationship for terrestrial ecosystem under future global warming scenario became dramatically different from those reported previously . Thus , we advocate that confidence limit are both necessary and feasible for simulated carbon budget from ecosystem model . Based on field measurement and model simulation , our study provides useful information for computing such confidence limit . In addition , our new model of temperature sensitivity of soil respiration seems more general and yet realistic , and can improve the accuracy of ecosystem model in predicting carbon flux at large scale .

aVThe precursor of the volatile S-compound dimethylsulfide ( DMS ) , dimethylsulfoniopropionate ( DMSP ) , is produced by marine microalgae , notably by Prymnesiophyceae . The production of DMSP by an axenic isolate of Emiliania huxleyi ( Lohm . ) Hay et Mohler under different temperature and light condition wa studied a a first step towards understanding the role of DMSP-producing algae in climate regulation . Both light and temperature affected growth rate and cell size in batch culture , but the concentration of DMSP in the cell wa dependent on temperature only : at low temperature DMSP accumulated . This physiological response , assumed to be characteristic of DMSP-producing microalgae in general , is in line with the correlation that ha been found between elevated concentration of the DMS oxidation product MSA in ice core slice corresponding with low sea surface temperature . Apparently , DMS doe not play the role in climate regulation formulated in the CLAW hypothesis that proposes a feedback mechanism in which elevated temperature lead to an increase in albedo via DMS-derived cloud condensation nucleus .

aVIn this note , new evidence is provided confirming that global temperature series spanning back to the mid-1800s have statistically significant positive trend . Although there is a growing consensus that global temperature are on the rise systematically , some recent study have pointed out that strong serial correlation ( or a unit root ) in global temperature data could , in theory , generate spurious evidence of a significant positive trend . In other word , strong serially correlated data can mimic trending behavior over fixed period of time . A serial-correlation-robust trend test recently wa proposed that control for the possibility of spurious evidence due to strong serial correlation . This new test is valid whether the error are stationary or have a unit root ( strong serial correlation ) . This test also ha the attractive feature that it doe not require estimate of serial correlation nuisance parameter . The test is applied to six annual global temperature series , and it provides strong evidence that global temperature series have positive trend that are statistically significant even when controlling for the possibility of strong serial correlation . The point estimate of the rate of increase in the trend suggest that temperature have risen about 0.5 degreesC ( 1.0 degreesF ) 100 yr ( -1 ) . If the analysis is restricted to twentieth-century data , many of the point estimate are closer to 0.6 degreesC .

aVAs ice cap expanded during each of the last five glaciation , sea level fell at least 120 m below current level , exposing continental shelf worldwide to create vast area of new land . As a result of this exposure , the ecology , climate , pedology , and geology of global shoreline were dramatically transformed , which in turn altered the carbon cycle and biodynamics of this new landmass . In this paper , we focus on a little-known hydrogeological phenomenon that may have had profound influence on biodiversity , human evolution , and carbon storage during period of severe climatic stress of the Pleistocene Ice Ages . We propose that freshwater spring appeared on emerged continental shelf because falling sea level not only drew down and steepened the coastal water table gradient , thus increasing the hydrostatic head on inland groundwater aquifer , but also removed up to 120 m of hydrostatic pressure on the shelf , further enhancing groundwater flow . We call this phenomenon the `` coastal oasis '' , a model based on three well-established fact . ( 1 ) In all coastal area of the world , continental aquifer discharge a continuous flow of fresh water to the ocean , ( 2 ) Many submarine sedimentary and morphological feature , a well a seepage and flow of fresh water , are known on and below the shelf from petroleum exploration , deep-sea drilling program , and mariner ' observation . ( 3 ) Hydraulic principle ( Darcy 's law ) predict increased groundwater flow at the coast when sea level drop because the piezometric head increase by the equivalent depth of sea-level lowering . Sea level is presently in a relatively high interglacial position . Direct observation and verification of our model is difficult and must rely on exploration of terrain that are now deeply submerged on continental shelf . For this reason , we draw parallel between our predicted model and simple , well-exposed terrestrial hydrological system , such a present-day spring that appear on the exposed shore of lake whose free-air water level fell during period of aridity . Such modem example are seen in the Caspian Sea and Dead Sea , the Afar Depression , and the Sahara Desert . These modem analogue demonstrate the likelihood that underground water will be more abundant on emerged shelf during sea-level fall , causing spring , oasis , and wetland to appear . Our model creates an apparent paradox : in tropical and subtropical arid land , such a most of Africa , sea-level fall during hyperarid glacial phase would produce abundant fresh water flow onto emerged continental shelf a the continental interior desiccated . Thus , emergent shoreline spring provided new habitat for terrestrial vegetation and animal displaced from the interior by increasingly arid condition , shrinking ecosystem , and dwindling water supply , Such a scenario would have had a profound influence on the vegetation that spread naturally to colonize the emerged shelf during glacio-eustatic sea-level lowstands , a well a creating new habitat for terrestrial mammal , including early human .

aVWidespread afforestation ha been proposed a one mean of addressing the increasing dryland and stream salinity problem in Australia , However , modelling result presented here suggest that large-scale tree planting will substantially reduce river flow and impose cost on downstream water user if planted in area of high runoff yield . Streamflow reduction in the Macquarie River , NSW , Australia are estimated for a number of tree planting scenario and global warming forecast . The modelling framework includes the Sacramento rainfall-runoff model and IQQM , a streamflow routing tool , a well a various global climate model output from which daily rainfall and potential evaporation data file have been generated in OzClim , a climate scenario generator . For a 10 % increase in tree cover in the headwater of the Macquarie , we estimate a 17 % reduction in inflow to Burrendong Dam . The drying trend for a mid-range scenario of regional rainfall and potential evaporation caused by a global warming of 0.5degreesC may cause an additional 5 % reduction in 2030 , These flow reduction will decrease the frequency of bird-breeding event in Macquarie Marshes ( a RAMSAR protected wetland ) and reduce the security of supply to irrigation area downstream . Inter-decadal climate variability is predicted to have a very significant influence on catchment hydrologic behaviour . A further 20 % reduction in flow from the long-term historical mean is possible , should we move into an extended period of below average rainfall year , such a occurred in eastern Australia between 1890 and 1948 . Because current consumptive water use is largely adapted to the wetter condition of post 1949 , a return to prolonged dry period would cause significant environmental stress given the agricultural and domestic water development that have been instituted .

aVOur paper document that land-use change impact regional and global climate through the surface-energy budget , a well a through the carbon cycle . The surface-energy budget effect may be more important than the carbon-cycle effect . However , land-use impact on climate can not be adequately quantified with the usual metric of 'global warming potential ' . A new metric is needed to quantify the human disturbance of the Earth 's surface-energy budget . This 'regional climate change potential ' could offer a new metric for developing a more inclusive climate protocol . This concept would also implicitly provide a mechanism to monitor potential local-scale environmental change that could influence biodiversity .

aVNutrient enrichment of coastal water is an example of the large-scale , highly complex environmental challenge facing decision maker today . Conventional monitoring network and advanced observational capability permit the detection of change in the environment at continental to global scale ( e.g. , hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico , aerosol plume stretching across the ocean , global atmospheric enrichment of carbon dioxide ) . Much more knowledge is needed , however , to fully understand the societal consequence of environmental change and of action taken to address diem . This paper discus the emerging role of assessment in developing effective U.S. policy response to large-scale , complex environmental change while improving the scientific understanding of the problem . In the case of global climate change and coastal hypoxia , the U.S. Congress passed legislation authorizing assessment recognizing that decision making must proceed in the face of scientific uncertainty . Evaluating the state of knowledge is usually the first step in an assessment in order to provide a picture of what is known and where there are knowledge gap . Assessments should also provide the policy maker with an idea of the level of uncertainty , how long it may take to reduce the uncertainty , what information is most critical to resolve , and the consequence and benefit of the various management option . In this paper I draw upon several example from national assessment , including those of climate change impact on the U.S. and relationship between Mississippi River water and Gulf of Mexico water quality , to illustrate the strength and difficulty of using science and assessment to inform the policy process .

aVOn 18/19 June 1998 the 1st TIGER Symposium wa held in Freiburg/Germany . After presentation and discussion of 28 invited and contributed talk , the symposium agreed to establish a longterm TIGER Program within the framework of the SCOSTEP International Solar Cycle Study Working Group 1 , Panel 2 . This decision is based on the general agreement that , for thermospheric-ionosphenic research a well a for a broad range of commercial application in space , the improvement of existing thermosphenic-ionospheric ( T/I ) model is absolutely necessary to meet scientific goal . There are a number of scientific question underlying the goal of understanding solar EUV/UV variability such a what are the primary mechanism by which solar ultraviolet ( UV ) , extreme ultraviolet ( EUV ) , and soft X-ray ( XUV ) irradiance variation affect terrestrial global climate change and/or weather and what is their significance ? How doe solar forcing compare with that from other source such a increasing concentration of radiatively-active gas and atmospheric aerosol ? How sensitive is the Earth 's climate to change in solar radiation ? What time scale of solar variability are significant to climate ? How might solar variability in these wavelength affect global warming projection ? Are there signature of solar influence in the upper atmosphere that are distinct from anthropogenic effect ? To meet these goal , coordinated work on the following topic is required and is discussed in detail below : 1 . Measurement and modelling of solar EUV/UV radiation 2 . Measurement and modelling of the solar wind ( particle ) originated energy T/I influx 3 . Measurement of relevant thermospheric-ionospheric parameter 4 . Modelling of the thermosphere/ionosphere 5 . Fundamental physical investigation of photoenergetic atomic and molecular process To make substantial progress in developing a complete understanding of the T/I process , it is necessary to envisage solar cycle and longer timescales . This can be done in the global change context by making use of a broad range of worldwide existing resource with respect to manpower , experience , hardware , method , flight opportunity , and funding resource . The TIGER Program alms to facilitate the coordination of these existing and planned activity and to help define missing link for achieving the scientific goal . ( C ) 2002 COSPAR .

aVUnderstanding the nature of recruitment relationship in the European lobster , Homarus gammarus , ha been an intractable problem because of difficulty associated with quantification of it scarce planktonic larva and early benthic phase . We attempt to address this problem by analyzing the age composition of a population off the northeast coast of England . Age-dependent in situ deposit of neurolipofuscin in the eyestalk are used a an age index . An approach is presented that account and ( or ) corrects for the two most important potential source of error in age determination by this technique , namely environmental temperature variation and unexplained individual variation . This yield , for the first time in very long-lived clawed lobster , reproducible catch age structure with year-class resolution . The method should be generally applicable to crustacean . Cross-correlation analysis show that larval settlement strength in the European lobster is associated with local sea temperature and onshore wind in a manner similar to that reported for other lobster . These finding have important implication for stock assessment , particularly the use of traditional model dependent on size and steady state , yield forecasting , the effect of global climate change , argument about spawner protection or restocking , and the spawner-recruit relationship .

aVThe ocean are a global reservoir and redistribution agent for several important constituent of the Earth 's climate system , among them heat , fresh water and carbon dioxide . Whereas these constituent are actively exchanged with the atmosphere , salt is a component that is approximately conserved in the ocean . The distribution of salinity in the ocean is widely measured , and can therefore be used to diagnose rate of surface freshwater flux ( 1 ) , freshwater transport ( 2 ) and local ocean mixing ( 3 ) - important component of climate dynamic . Here we present a comparison of salinity on a long transect ( 50degrees S to 60degrees N ) through the western basin of the Atlantic Ocean between the 1950s and the 1990s . We find systematic freshening at both poleward end contrasted with large increase of salinity pervading the upper water column at low latitude . Our result extend a growing body of evidence indicating that shift in the oceanic distribution of fresh and saline water are occurring worldwide in way that suggest link to global warming and possible change in the hydrologic cycle of the Earth .

aVGrowing concern about global climate change , biodiversity maintenance , natural resource conservation , and long-term ecosystem sustainability have been responsible for the transformation of traditional single resource management approach into integrated ecosystem management model . Eco-regions are large ecosystem of regional extent that contain smaller ecosystem of similar response potential and resource production capability . They can be used a a geographical framework for organizing and reporting resource information , setting bioecological recovery criterion , extrapolating site-level management , and monitoring global change . The objective of this research is to develop a quantitative , multivariate regionalization model that is capable of delineating eco-regions at multiple level from remotely sensed information and other environmental and natural resource spatial data . The Spatial Pattern Analysis Model developed in this study us a region-growing algorithm to generate spatially contiguous region from primitive polygonal land unit . The algorithm merges the most similar pair of neighbouring unit at each iteration , based on satisfying certain similarity criterion until all unit are grouped into one . This model wa utilized to develop an eco-region map of Nebraska with three hierarchical level . In the mapping process , the STATSGO data set wa used to build the primitive map unit . Environmental parameter included in the model were multi-temporal AVHRR data , soil rooting depth , organic matter content , available water capacity , and long-term annual average of water balance and growing degree day total . Development of the model provides a new and useful approach to eco-region mapping for resource manager and researcher . The method is automated and efficient , reduces the judgement bias and uncertainty of manual analysis , and can be replicated for other region or for the regionalization of other theme .

aVAt present , 50 % ( w/w ) carbon is widely promulgated a a generic value for wood ; however , the literature yield few data and indicates that very little research ha actually been done . C content in heartwood of forty-one softwood and hardwood specie were determined . C in kiln-dried hardwood specie ranged from 46.27 % to 49.97 % ( w/w ) , in conifer from 47.21 % to 55.2 % . The higher C in conifer agrees with their higher lignin content ( similar to 30 % , versus similar to 20 % for hardwood ) . Wood-meal sample drilled from discrete early wood and late wood zone of seven of the forty-one specie were also investigated . C content of early wood were invariably higher than those in corresponding late wood , again in agreement with early wood having higher lignin content . Further investigation wa made into freshly harvested wood of some specie to determine how much volatile C is present , comparing oven-dried wood meal with wood meal dried at ambient temperature over a desiccant . C content of oven-dried wood were significantly lower , indicating that all past data on C content in oven- or kiln-dried wood may be inaccurate in relation to the true C content of forest . We conclude that C content varies substantially among specie a well a within individual tree . Clearly , a 50 % generic value is an oversimplification of limited application in relation to global warming and the concept of `` carbon credit '' . ( C ) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVThe purpose of our study wa to establish a seasonal model to simulate the oscillation of the number of influenza case with weather condition and calendar month in Tokyo , Japan , during the winter season . Surveillance data for influenza in Tokyo wa retrieved from the Infectious Agents Surveillance Report , published by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Japan . We obtained data for 86 parameter of weather condition from the Meteorological Agency . The best-fit model wa built by multiple regression with stepwise analysis . The reported number of patient with influenza per week wa significantly increased with fewer day of maximum temperature greater than or equal to10 degreesC per week ( T10 ) and more day of relative humidity < 60 % per week ( S60 ) , adjusted by calendar month , average temperature , and vapor pressure . Annual oscillation of the number of reported influenza case at the start , peak , and end week almost exactly matched the model , although peak level for each oscillation did not always match . However , this model showed that 81 % of the variation among the observed number of influenza case wa explained by a linear relationship with the seasonal parameter utilized . The validity of this model applied to data from 1999 to 2002 , showing a 75 % correlation . Using this model , if the number of day with both T10 and S60 increased by one per week , the number of influenza case wa simulated to decrease by approximately half . These result suggest that most of the oscillation in the number of influenza case may be explained using a seasonal model that can simulate the impact of global warming .

aVA simple Earth system model , the Four-Spheres Cycle of Energy and Mass ( 4-SCEM ) model , ha been developed to simulate global warming due to anthropogenic CO2 emission . The model consists of the Atmosphere-Earth Heat Cycle ( AEHC ) model , the Four Spheres Carbon Cycle ( 4-SCC ) model , and their feedback process . The AEHC model is a one-dimensional radiative convective model , which includes the greenhouse effect of CO2 and H2O , and one cloud layer . The 4-SCC model is a box-type carbon cycle model , which includes biospheric CO2 fertilization , vegetation area variation , the vegetation light saturation effect and the HILDA oceanic carbon cycle model . The feedback process between carbon cycle and climate considered in the model are temperature dependency of water vapor content , soil decomposition and ocean surface chemistry . The future status of the global carbon cycle and climate wa simulated up to the year 2100 based on the `` business a usual '' ( IS92a ) emission scenario , followed by a linear decline in emission to zero in the year 2200 . The atmospheric CO2 concentration reach 645 ppmv in 2100 and a peak of 760 ppmv approximately in the year 2170 , and becomes a steady state with 600 ppmv . The projected CO2 concentration wa lower than those of the past carbon cycle study , because we included the light saturation effect of vegetation . The sensitivity analysis showed that uncertainty derived from the light saturation effect of vegetation and land use CO2 emission were the primary cause of uncertainty in projecting future CO2 concentration . The climate feedback effect showed rather small sensitivity compared with the impact of those two effect . Satellite-based net primary production trend analysis can somewhat decrease the uncertainty in quantifying CO2 emission due to land use change . On the other hand , a the estimated parameter in vegetation light saturation wa poorly constrained , we have to quantify and constrain the effect more accurately .

aV[ 1 ] It is a truism in geomorphology that climatic event operate on a landscape to drive sediment transport process , yet few investigation have formally linked climate and terrain characteristic with geomorphological process . In this study , we incorporate sediment transport equation derived from fieldwork into a computer model that predicts the delivery of sediment from hillslopes in a steep Mediterranean landscape near Santa Barbara , California . The sediment transport equation are driven by rainstorm and fire that are stochastically generated from probability distribution . The model is used to compare the rate and process of sediment delivery under two vegetation type : coastal sage scrub and grassland . Conversion of vegetation from sage to exotic grass is a common land management strategy in the region and may also be engendered by regional climate change due to global warming . Results from the model suggest that ( 1 ) approximately 40 % more sediment is delivered from grassland ( 98 t km ( -2 ) yr ( -1 ) ) than the sage scrub ( 71 t km ( -2 ) yr ( -1 ) ) and ( 2 ) chronic soil creep process dominate under grassland whereas catastrophic process dominate under coastal sage scrub . Results from the model also suggest that change in the spatial distribution of vegetation arising from climate change will have a greater effect on sediment delivery than change in the magnitude and frequency of meteorological event .

aVA water-balance model wa developed for a tidal lake-wetland complex to : ( 1 ) determine the relative contribution of hydrological flow through the lake-wetland complex ; ( 2 ) determine the tidal and non-tidal hydraulic residence time of two lake in the lake-wetland complex ; and ( 3 ) estimate the potential importance of groundwater input to the lake-wetland complex . All surface hydrological input to the system were either measured or estimated over 1 year . Daily evaporation from the water body wa also estimated . Discharge at the outflow of the lake-wetland complex wa monitored to calculate the net daily outflow . A correction procedure wa used to remove the error resulting from aliasing of the daily calculation period and the tidal period . The difference between the measured net outflow and that calculated by the water-balance model indicated that a large amount of net discharge from the lake-wetland complex may have been a result of previously unrecognised groundwater input to the system . The non-tidal hydraulic residence time of the two lake differed markedly a did the relative importance of tidal inflow . The influence of variation in tidal and non-tidal hydraulic residence time on limnological process is discussed , particularly with respect to impact of global climate change on tidal lake ecosystem .

Research on the impact and adaptation measure for global warming in Japan is reviewed . One of the most significant impact of climate change in Japan will exacerbate the existing heat island phenomenon in city by absorbing increased solar radiation . This will lead to further increase in temperature in an urban microclimate with negative implication for energy and water consumption , human health and discomfort , and local ecosystem . The current urban heat island phenomenon and it impact are described . The relationship between climate change and urban heat island impact are discussed . Potential adaptation measure to those impact are also discussed and proposed .

aVResponsible emission of anthropogenic carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) are currently estimated according to the principle of territorial responsibility ; that is , individual country are only responsible for the anthropogenic CO2 emission within their own political boundary . In the context of globalization of world economy , such an accounting principle would easily result in carbon leakage , thus undermining the effect of global warming combat . From the perspective of benefit principle and ecological deficit , this paper develops a framework to estimate the amount of responsible anthropogenic CO2 over-emissions , which serf a a basis for calculating the amount of anthropogenic CO2 reduction that a defined country is responsible for . The benefit principle assigns the responsibility of pollutant emission to the driving force behind the activity that emit pollutant rather than to direct emitter . The perspective of ecological deficit proposes that a country should take the responsibility for reducing pollutant emission when it run the deficit of assimilation , that is , it responsible emission exceeding it capacity of assimilation . The proposed framework is demonstrated using the data of Taiwan in 1996 , and discussion on improving and extending the framework in future research are provided . ( C ) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

aV[ 1 ] An important component of ice sheet mass balance calculation is the snow accumulation rate , traditionally determined across the ice sheet from interpolated ice core data . We derive an accumulation rate map within the Greenland dry-snow facies , using C-band radar backscatter and the mean annual temperature . Values for the backscatter were obtained from the ERS-1 synthetic aperture radar mosaic acquired during September November 1992 . An empirical equation , based on elevation and latitude , is used to determine the mean annual temperature . We examine the influence of accumulation rate , and mean annual temperature on C-band ( 5.3 GHz ) radar backscatter , using a forward model , which incorporates snow metamorphosis and radar backscatter component . Our model is run over a range of accumulation and temperature condition , consistent with the Greenland dry-snow facies . On the basis of our modeled result , a look-up table is generated , which uniquely map the measured radar backscatter and mean annual temperature to accumulation rate . Our result compare favorably ( 15.4 % average difference ) with 124 in situ accumulation rate measurement falling within our study area . We attribute some of the difference to ( 1 ) unreliable in situ data point , which were based on a single year 's accumulation and ( 2 ) a systematic underestimate of accumulation rate by our forward model in the low-accumulation region associated with the northern portion of our map . With questionable data point and those above 77 degreesN removed , the average difference were le than 10.3 % , a determined from 73 ice core .

aVA continuous age model for the brief climate excursion at the Paleocene-Eocene boundary ha been constructed by assuming a constant flux of extraterrestrial He-3 ( He-3 ( ET ) ) to the seafloor . ( HeET ) -He-3 measurement from ODP Site 690 provide quantitative evidence for the rapid onset ( < few kyr ) and short duration ( < 120 kyr ) of global warming and of the associated disturbance to the Earth 's surficial carbon budget at this time . These observation support astronomically calibrated age model indicating extremely rapid release of isotopically light carbon , possibly from seafloor methane hydrate , a ' the proximal cause of the event . However , the He-3 ( ET ) technique indicates a previously unrecognized and extreme increase in sedimentation rate coincident with the return of climate proxy to pre-event value . The He-3 ( ET ) -based age model thus suggests a far more rapid recovery from the climatic perturbation than previously proposed or predicted on the basis of the modern carbon cycle , and so may indicate additional or accelerated mechanism of carbon removal from the ocean-atmosphere system during this period . He-3 ( ET ) wa also measured at ODP Site 1051 to test the validity of the Site 690 chronology . Comparison of these data set seems to require removal of several ten of kyr of sediment within the climatic excursion at Site 1051 , an observation consistent with sediment structure and previous age modeling effort . The Site 1051 age model show a similar to30 kyr period in which climate proxy return toward pre-event value , after which they remain invariant for similar to80 kyr . If this rise represents the recovery interval identified at Site 690 , then the 3 HeET-based age model of the two site are in good agreement . However , alternative interpretation are possible , and work on le disrupted site is required to evaluate the reliability of the proposed new chronology of the climate excursion . Regardless of these detail , this work show that the 3HeET technique can provide useful independent evidence for the development and testing of astronomically calibrated age model .

aVThis paper present an alternative framework to the approach currently embodied in the Kyoto Protocol for managing global climate change post-2012 . The framework ha two key provision . The first is that each person in the world would be 'allowed ' an equal amount of greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emission . This is labeled the equity-first provision . The second provision focus on incorporating risk concept into the setting of GHG emission reduction . It is proposed that the global climate be managed a to avoid three category of risk : ( I ) Substantial regional economic , political , and/or biological impact ; ( II ) Severe global economic , political , and/or biological impact ; and ( III ) Extinction of human . Acceptable risk threshold are suggested to be one-in-a-million , one-in-one-hundred-million , and one-in-ten-billion , respectively . This equity-first , risk-based framework overcomes many criticism of the current Kyoto Protocol : it explicitly involves all country on earth ; it avoids several administrative issue that are anticipated to plague a global carbon emission trading market ; and it avoids several contentious issue associated with pegging carbon emission reduction to 1990 level . Because the framework is risk-based and emission are tied to population and not historic emission level , the basic framework would not have to be frequently renegotiated , a will be needed for the Kyoto-style approach to take the world past that agreement 's 2012 endpoint .

While others have examined historical pattern in tropical cyclone frequency and intensity , and generally found no trend in recent decade , we analyzed tropical cyclone record from the Caribbean , Gulf of Mexico , and tropical sector of the western North Atlantic over the period 1950-2002 with a focus on the duration , seasonal timing , and geographic position of the event . We found no significant trend in the start date , ending date , or duration of the storm season ( defined in various way ) and no trend in the average geographic position of the storm . Furthermore , these measure of hurricane season timing and storm location were not related to regional sea surface temperature or the northern hemispheric or global temperature .

aVThe secular variation over the global land annual precipitation ( GLAP ) field for 1948-2000 is investigated . Evidence suggests that the GLAP abruptly reduced around 1978 and experienced a decrease of 0.54 mm/a , on average . Fuzzy clustering is used to group the annual precipitation over commonly-used 36 latitude belt into six belt for examining it secular variation . The result show that , except northern high-latitudes ( 60degrees-90degrees N ) where it is slightly increased , the precipitation is decreased , especially in 35degrees N-35degrees S , and the diminution is the maximum of 0.98 mm/a at tropic . Moreover , identification of 1948-2000 flood/drought year on a global basis is made , showing noticeable interdecadal variation . During the year of warm ( cold ) event the precipitation decrease ( increase ) by 15.4 min ( 14.4 mm ) per year , on average . It can be assumed that global warming and frequent ENSO occurrence from the end of the 1970s maybe serve a the root cause of the diminution .

aVGoal , Scope and Background . Assessing future energy and transport system is of major importance for providing timely information for decision maker . In the discussion of technology option , fuel cell are often portrayed a attractive option for power plant and automotive application . However , when analysing these system , the LCA analyst is confronted with methodological problem , particularly with data gap and the requirement of an anticipation of future development . This series of two paper aim at providing a methodological framework for assessing future energy and transport system ( Part 1 ) and applies this to the two major application area of fuel cell ( Part 2 ) . Methods . To allow the LCA of future energy and transport system forecasting tool like , amongst others , cost estimation method and process simulation of system are investigated with respect to the applicability in LCAs of future system ( Part 1 ) . The manufacturing process of an SOFC stack is used a an illustration for the forecasting procedure . In Part 2 , detailed LCAs of fuel cell power plant and power train are carried out including fuel ( hydrogen , methanol , gasoline , diesel and natural gas ) and energy converter production . To compare it with competing technology , internal combustion engine ( automotive application ) and reciprocating engine , gas turbine and combined cycle plant ( stationary application ) are analysed a well . Results and Discussion . Principally , the investigated forecasting method are suitable for future energy system assessment . The selection of the best method depends on different factor such a required ressources , quality of the result and flexibility . In particular , the time horizon of the investigation determines which forecasting tool may be applied . Environmentally relevant process step exhibiting a significant time dependency shall always be investigated using different independent forecasting tool to ensure stability of the result . The result of the LCA ( Part 2 ) underline that principally , fuel cell offer advantage in the impact category which are typically dominated by pollutant emission , such a acidification and eutrophication , whereas for global warming and primary energy demand , the situation depends on a set of parameter such a driving cycle and fuel economy ratio in mobile application and thermal/total efficiency in stationary application . For the latter impact category , the choice of the primary energy carrier for fuel production ( renewable or fossil ) dominates the impact reduction , With increasing efficiency and improving emission performance of the conventional system , the competition regarding all impact category in both mobile and stationary application is getting even stronger . The production of the fuel cell system is of low overall significance in stationary application , whereas in automotive application , the production of the fuel cell power train and required material lead to increased impact compared to internal combustion engine and thus reduces the achievable environmental impact reduction . Recommendations and Perspectives . The rapid technological and energy economic development will bring further advance for both fuel cell and conventional energy converter . Therefore , LCAs at such an early stage of the market development can only be considered preliminary . It is an essential requirement to accompany the ongoing research and development with iterative LCAs , constantly pointing at environmental hot spot and bottleneck .

aVTo meet Turkey 's growing energy demand , the installed electric power capacity of 27.8 GW in 2001 ha to be doubled by 2010 and increased fourfold by 2020 . The difference between Turkey 's total primary energy supply ( TPES ) of from it own source and total final consumption ( TFC ) is projected grow from 1 quad ( 1.06-2.06 ) in 1999 to 5.71 quad ( 2.79-8.5 ) in 2020 ( 1 quad = 293.071 TWh ) . Turkey 's limited amount of fossil fuel ha a present average ratio of proved reserve of 97.38 quad to production rate of 3.2 quad yr ( -1 ) of about 30 year . Turkey 's reliance on fossil fuel-based energy system to meet the growing demand is most likely to exacerbate the issue of energy insecurity , national environmental degradation , and global climate change in increasing proportion . Economically-feasible renewable energy potential in Turkey is estimated at a total of ca . 1.69 quad yr ( -1 ) ( 495.4 TWh yr ( -1 ) ) with the potential for 0.67 quad yr ( -1 ) ( 196.7 TWh yr ( -1 ) ) of biomass energy , 0.42 quad yr ( -1 ) ( 124 TWh yr ( -1 ) ) of hydropower , 0.35 quad yr ( -1 ) ( 102.3 TWh yr ( -1 ) ) of solar energy , 0.17 quad yr ( -1 ) ( 50 TWh yr ( -1 ) ) of wind energy , and 0.08 quad yr ( -1 ) ( 22.4 TWh yr ( -1 ) ) of geothermal energy . Pursuit and implementation of sustainability-based energy policy could provide about 90 and 35 % of Turkey 's total energy supply and consumption projected in 2010 , respectively . Utilization of renewable energy technology for electricity generation would necessitate about 23.2 Mha ( 29.8 % ) of Turkey 's land resource . ( C ) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All right reserved .

aVComplex organismal trait such a body size are influenced by innumerable selective pressure , making the prediction of evolutionary trajectory for those trait difficult . A potentially powerful way to predict fitness in natural system is to study the composite response of individual in term of performance measure , such a foraging or reproductive performance . Once key performance measure are identified in this top-down approach , we can determine the underlying physiological mechanism and gain predictive power over long-term evolutionary process . Here we use marine iguana a a model system where body size differs by more than one order of magnitude between island population . We identified foraging efficiency a the main performance measure that constrains body size . Mechanistically , foraging performance is determined by food pasture height and the thermal environment , influencing intake and digestion . Stress hormone may be a flexible way of influencing an individual 's response to low-food situation that may be caused by high population density , famine , or anthropogenic disturbance like oil spill . Reproductive performance , on the other hand , increase with body size and is mediated by higher survival of larger hatchling from larger female and increased mating success of larger male . Reproductive performance of male may be adjusted via plastic hormonal feedback mechanism that allow individual to ass their social rank annually within the current population size structure . When integrated , these data suggest that reproductive performance favor increased body size ( influenced by reproductive hormone ) , with an overall limit imposed by foraging performance ( influenced by stress hormone ) . Based on our mechanistic understanding of individual performance we predicted an evolutionary increase in maximum body size caused by global warming trend . We support this prediction using specimen collected during 1905 . We also show in a common-garden experiment that body size may have a genetic component in iguanid . This 'performance paradigm ' allows prediction about adaptive evolution in natural population .

aVThe response of continental climate to the well-documented climate oscillation during the last glacial period ha been a subject of intense interest , yet much le is known about the influence on regional continental climate than in the marine or polar realm of Earth . The detailed lake-level history of the closed Lake Lisan ( paleo-Dead Sea ) in the Middle East ha been reconstructed from shoreline indication and high-resolution U-Th and C-14 chronology , thus providing data on the response of the lake 's catchment area to the climate change during the corresponding period . We present a correlation between the newly developed Lake Lisan level curve for the past 55 k.y : and the North Atlantic Heinrich event . The correlation indicates a closely connected climate response between these North Atlantic event and the hydrologic condition that prevailed in the Eastern Mediterranean . Our finding show that although the generally cooler condition that prevailed during the last glaciation favored high level of the lake , catastrophic event in the North Atlantic , which are associated with maximum cooling , have been responsible for drought in the Eastern Mediterranean . We infer that cold-water input to the Mediterranean originating in the collapse of the North Atlantic Deep Water circulation caused the reduction of evaporation and le precipitation in the Eastern Mediterranean .

aVSince publication of the 1998 UNEP Assessment , there ha been continued rapid expansion of the literature on UV-B radiation . Many measurement have demonstrated the inverse relationship between column ozone amount and UV radiation , and in a few case long-term increase due to ozone decreases-have been identified . The quantity , quality and availability of ground-based UV measurement relevant to assessing the environmental impact of ozone change continue to improve . Recent study have contributed to delineating regional and temporal difference due to aerosol , cloud , and ozone . Improvements in radiative transfer modelling capability now enable more accurate characterization of cloud , snow-cover , and topographical effect . A standardized scale for reporting UV to the public ha gained wide acceptance . There ha been increased use of satellite data to estimate geographic variability and trend in UV . Progress ha been made in assessing the utility of satellite retrieval of UV radiation by comparison with measurement at the Earth 's surface . Global climatology of UV radiation are now available on the Internet . Anthropogenic aerosol play a more important role in attenuating UV irradiances than ha been assumed previously , and this will have implication for the accuracy of UV retrieval from satellite data . Progress ha been made inferring historical level of UV , radiation using measurement of ozone ( from satellite or from ground-based network ) in conjunction with measurement of total solar radiation obtained from extensive meteorological network . We can not yet be sure whether global ozone ha reached a minimum . Atmospheric chlorine concentration are beginning to decrease . However , bromine concentration are still increasing . While these halogen concentration remain high , the ozone layer remains vulnerable to further depletion from event such a volcanic eruption that inject material into the stratosphere . Interactions between global warming and ozone depletion could delay ozone recovery by several year , and this topic remains an area of intense research interest . Future change in greenhouse gas will affect the future evolution of ozone through chemical , radiative , and dynamic process . In this highly coupled system , an evaluation of the relative importance of these process is difficult ; study are ongoing . A reliable assessment of these effect on total column ozone is limited by uncertainty in lower stratospheric response to these change . At several site , change in UV differ from those expected from ozone change alone , possibly a a result of long-term change in aerosol , snow cover , or cloud . This indicates a possible interaction between climate change and UV radiation . Cloud reflectance measured by satellite ha shown a long-term increase at some location , especially in the Antarctic region , but also in Central Europe , which would tend to reduce the UV radiation . Even with the expected decrease in atmospheric chlorine , it will be several year before the beginning of an ozone recovery can be unambiguously identified at individual location . Because UV-B is more variable than ozone , any identification of it recovery would be further delayed .

aVThree climatically diverse region were studied to determine the impact of temperature change on heat-related mortality from 1971 to 1997 . Median regression showed that May-August temperature in North Carolina rose by 1.0degreesC ( 95 % CL 0.0-2.0degreesC ) from 23.5degreesC ( 74.3degreesF ) , were unchanged in South Finland at 13.5degreesC ( 56.3degreesF ) , and rose in Southeast England 2.1degreesC ( 0.3-4.0degreesC ) from 14.9degreesC ( 58.8degreesF ) . After determining for each region the daily temperature ( a a 3degreesC band ) at which the mortality wa the lowest , annual heat-related mortality wa obtained a excess mortality per million at temperature above this . Annual heat-related mortality per million ( among the population at risk , aged 55+ ) fell in North Carolina by 212 ( 59-365 ) from 228 ( 140-317 ) to only 16 ( not significant , NS ) ; fell in South Finland by 282 ( 66-500 ) from 382 ( 257-507 ) to 99 ( NS ) ; and fell in Southeast England by 2.4 ( NS ) from 111 ( 41-180 ) to 108 ( 41-176 ) . The fall in North Carolina and South Finland remained significant after allowance were made for change in age , sex , and baseline mortality . Increased air conditioning probably explains the virtual disappearance of heat-related mortality in the hottest region , North Carolina , despite warmer summer . Other lifestyle change associated with increasing prosperity probably explain the favorable trend in the cooler region . ( C ) 2002 Elsevier Science ( USA ) . All right reserved .

aVAerial image of the high summit of the Spanish Central Range reveal significant change in vegetation over the period 1957 to 1991 . These change include the replacement of high-mountain grassland community dominated by Festuca aragonensis , typical of the Cryoro-Mediterranean belt , by shrub patch of Juniperus communis ssp . alpina and Cytisus oromediterraneus from lower altitude ( Oro-Mediterranean belt ) . Climatic data indicate a shift towards warmer condition in this mountainous region since the 1940s , with the shift being particularly marked from 1960 . Changes include significantly higher minimum and maximum temperature , fewer day with snow cover and a redistribution of monthly rainfall . Total yearly precipitation showed no significant variation . There were no marked change in land use during the time frame considered , although there were minor change in grazing specie in the 19th century . It is hypothesized that the advance of woody specie into higher altitude is probably related to climate change , which could have acted in conjunction with discrete variation in landscape management . The pronounced change observed in the plant community of the area reflect the susceptibility of high-mountain Mediterranean specie to environmental change . ( C ) 2003 Annals of Botany Company .

aVContinental flood basalt ( CFB ) volcanism is hypothesized to have played a causative role in global climate change and mass extinction . Uncertainties associated with radiometric dating preclude a clear chronological assessment of the environmental consequence of CFB volcanism . Our result document a 25 % decline in the marine Os-187/Os-188 record that predates the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary ( KTB ) and coincides with late Maastrichtian warming . We argue that this decline provides a chemostratigraphic marker of Deccan volcanism and thus constitutes compelling evidence that the main environmental consequence of Deccan volcanism wa a transient global warming event of 3degrees to 5degreesC that is fully resolved from the KTB mass extinction .

aVAlthough the effect of climate warming on the chemical and physical property of lake have been documented ( 1 ) , biotic and ecosystem-scale response to climate change have been only estimated or predicted by manipulation and model ( 1 ) . Here we present evidence that climate warming is diminishing productivity in Lake Tanganyika , East Africa . This lake ha historically supported a highly productive pelagic fishery that currently provides 25-40 % of the animal protein supply for the population of the surrounding country ( 2 ) . In parallel with regional warming pattern since the beginning of the twentieth century , a rise in surface-water temperature ha increased the stability of the water column . A regional decrease in wind velocity ha contributed to reduced mixing , decreasing deep-water nutrient upwelling and entrainment into surface water . Carbon isotope record in sediment core suggest that primary productivity may have decreased by about 20 % , implying a roughly 30 % decrease in fish yield . Our study provides evidence that the impact of regional effect of global climate change on aquatic ecosystem function and service can be larger than that of local anthropogenic activity or overfishing .

aVCoalbed methane ( CBM ) is the generic name for all methane of coal seam origin . It is a natural gas formed by geological , or biological , process in coal seam and generally consists predominantly of methane , but may also contain some higher alkane and non-combustible gas . Methane is released whenever coal is de-stressed or fractured by mining . Methane is one of the main greenhouse gas contributing to global warming , therefore releasing it to atmosphere is an environmental hazard . However , it is also an important energy resource and can be recovered from operational coal mine , abandoned coal mine , and virgin ( unmined ) coal seam . Significant volume of CBM are exploited worldwide for space heating , industrial process , and power generation . This paper critically review the current UK and worldwide status of CBM extraction and utilization technology building on a previous study funded through the Department of Trade and Industry 's Cleaner Coal Technology Programme [ 1 ] .

aVGlobal warming is a serious problem requiring immediate countermeasure . Large-scale afforestation in and area for the aim of absorbing CO2 is considered to be one of these measure and the research activity for it have been carried out in Leonora , Western Australia . In this study , the relationship between the biomass distribution and topographic feature wa examined in order to collect basic information for the selection of suitable afforestation region in the research area using a biomass distribution map and some topographic element . The result were a follows . ( 1 ) Plant growth is related to the movement of and the volume of runoff water derived from inequality of the ground , which lead to a biased distribution of nutrient accumulation and of surface soil thickness . ( 2 ) The total potential biomass estimated from the present topography is greater than the present biomass in the 30 km x 50 km research area . A mass of 319 kt-C could be absorbed in the research area without any improvement in the landform . ( 3 ) A substantial improvement on the environment utilizing vast and area by afforestation is necessary to fix enough carbon deterring global warming .

aVBiotic pollination should be an important consideration when devising management plan for endangered plant specie . In this study we documented inter-annual shift in the suite of floral visitor to Clematis socialis , a federally endangered specie . These pollinator shift were correlated with shift in climatic variable that we used a a proxy for the potential effect of climatic change . In addition , we characterized floral visitor behavior and conducted single-visit seed set experiment to ass the pollination effectiveness of floral visitor . Five insect specie visited flower of C. socialis : two lepidopteran specie ( Erynnis juvenalis and Hemaris diffinis ) and three bee specie ( Anthophora ursina , Bombus pennsylvanicus and Xylocopa virginica ) . Due to their relatively greater frequency of flower visitation and high single-visit seed set ( ca . 2.6-3 seeds/visit ) , two bee specie ( Anthophora ursina and Bombus pennsylvanicus ) are considered to be the major pollinator of C. socialis . However , the relative importance of each pollinator specie varied between year . Anthophora ursina wa the most important pollinator in 1997 , a year when C. socialis bloomed later in the spring . Queens of Boinbus pennsylvanicus were the primary pollinator during 1996 , a year when C. socialis bloomed relatively early in the spring . We conclude that management plan that focus on the `` best pollinator '' of a suite of pollinator may not preserve the long-term reproductive integrity of endangered plant with generalized pollination system . We further conclude that asynchrony between flowering season and pollinator activity pattern may be a risk factor associated with human-caused global climate change .

aVWe have used correlative analysis between mean December-January-February winter wind velocity , measured at the Xisha Meteorological Observatory ( 16degrees50'N , 112degrees20'E ) in the middle of the South China Sea , and mean 518 0 data for the corresponding month from Porites lutea coral , collected in Longwan water ( 19degrees20'N , 110degrees39'E ) , to obtain a linear equation relating the two datasets . This winter wind velocity for the South China Sea ( WMIIscs ) can then be correlated to the coral delta ( 18 ) O by the equation WMIIscs = -1.213-1.351 delta ( 18 ) O ( part per thousand PDB ) , r = -0.60 , n = 40 , P = 0.01 . From this , the calculated WMIIscs-delta18O series from 1944 to 1997 tends to decrease during the 1940s to the 1960s ; it increase slightly during the 1970s and then decrease again in the 1980s and 1990s . The calculated decadal mean WMIIscs-delta18O series had a obvious decrease from 5.92 to 4.63 m/s during the period of 1944-1997 . The calculated yearly mean WMIIscs-delta18O value is 5.58 m/s from 1944 to 1976 and this decrease to 4.85 m/s from 1977 to 1998 . That is the opposite trend to the observed yearly mean SST variation . The yearly mean SST anomaly is -0.27degrees from 1943 to 1976 and this increase to +0.16degrees from 1977 to 1998 . Spectral analysis used on a 54-year-long calculated WMIIscs-delta18O series produce spectral peak at 2.4-7 yr , which can be closely correlated with the quasibiennial oscillation band ( QBO band , 2-2.4 yr ) and the El Nino southern oscillation band ( ENSO band , 3-8 yr ) . Hence most of the variability of the winter monsoon intensity in the middle of the South China Sea is mainly constrained by change in the thermal difference between the land and the adjoining sea area , perhaps due to global warming .

aVClimate is one of the determinant driving ecosystem on both local and global scale . During the last two decade , there ha occurred a dramatic temperature increase in the northern midlatitudes to high latitude . The rapid warming ha resulted in the promotion of bioactivity and an early growing season . However , the temperature and vegetation change are not uniform in geographical distribution . In the present study , we analyze the spatial feature in the normalized difference vegetation index ( NDVI ) -temperature relationship over Eurasia and North America in spring for the period 1982-2000 . The NDVI data are derived from the Earth Observing System Pathfinder advanced very high resolution radiometer data set . A singular value decomposition analysis is applied to the covariance matrix of the NDVI and temperature . Most of the squared covariance , 91.6 % , is captured by the first seven paired mode . The result clearly indicates that the temperature is a focal factor influencing vegetation activity . Furthermore , those seven paired mode show large-scale feature and well-defined pattern . The atmospheric circulation system , such a the Southern Oscillation , North Atlantic Oscillation/Arctic Oscillation , Pacific/North American pattern , Eurasian pattern , western Pacific pattern , western Atlantic pattern , eastern Atlantic pattern , and North Pacific index , are found to be associated with that . The time coefficient corresponding to the first paired mode , centered on western Siberia , is correlated significantly with the Eurasian teleconnection pattern . Their correlation coefficient are 0.72 and 0.78 for vegetation and temperature , respectively , for the data period . Other mode are also correlated with one or more circulation index . This implies that the large-scale circulation is essential for understanding the regional response of vegetation to global climate change . Taking all nine circulation index and time lag into account , a large portion ( 71 % ) of the satellite-sensed variance in NDVI could be explained . The temperature-NDVI relationship did not change significantly when the NDVI wa rescaled from 1 to 5 degree , indicating that the singular value decomposition analysis is an appropriate technique for detecting the degree of coupling between vegetation and climate and that the vegetation-temperature relationship presented in this study is robust .

aVSequestration of liquid CO2 in intermediate depth ocean ha been considered a a mean to reduce atmospheric concentration of the greenhouse gas and to mitigate global warming . The dissolution behavior of CO2 in pure/sea water wa investigated under the condition of the intermediate depth ocean , i.e. , high pressure and low temperature condition . In these condition , CO2 clathrate hydrate film wa formed at the interface between CO2 and water . The solubility of CO2 wa derived by measuring the shrinking rate of the diameter of CO2 droplet . The solubility wa investigated qualitatively with changing pressure , salinity and temperature . It wa clarified that the solubility increased with the increase of pressure and salinity . The hydrate film , which wa formed at low temperature condition , much affected the solubility . The author applied a laser induced fluorescence ( LIF ) technique for the measurement of pH distribution around a CO2 droplet dissolving into pure water with or without the hydrate film . CO2 solution emitted intense fluorescence dependently on it pH . The visualized image of pH distribution , CO2 concentration around the dissolving CO2 droplet wa calculated .

aVOne hypothesis for amphibian decline is that increased dryness attributed to global climate change expose amphibian to greater biotic threat and , consequently , greater mortality . But , little is known about behavioral response of terrestrial amphibian to dry condition alone or in combination with biotic threat . We used field observation and laboratory experiment to test the response of eft ( terrestrial juvenile ) of the eastern red-spotted newt , Notophthalmus viridescens , to separate and combined desiccation and predation risk . When only at risk of desiccation , eft moved into shade , traveled down slope , decreased activity , and adopted water-conserving posture . Efts also significantly reduced the rate of water loss by huddling and were attracted to chemical cue from conspecific eft but not from conspecific adult . Thus , eft have a variety of behavior that reduce the risk of dehydration associated with climate change . When faced only with a predation risk , represented by adult and eft newt tissue extract ( alarm chemical ) , eft reduced their activity and avoided alarm cue from both source . When exposed to combined desiccation and predation risk , eft were le active than when exposed to either risk separately and avoided adult tissue extract , but not eft extract . These result suggest that under dry condition , conspecific tissue extract contain both attractive ( huddling ) and repulsive ( predator-related ) chemical component that induce offsetting behavioral response . This is the first study to demonstrate moisture-dependent response to conspecific rinse and alarm substance , underscoring the importance of considering environmental moisture and animal hydration in study examining response to conspecific odor and/or alarm chemical . These result support the hypothesis that elevated dehydration risk may compromise anti-predator behavior and exacerbate amphibian population decline .

aVIn this study , remote plasma cleaning process wa investigated in a silicon nitride plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition chamber using C4F8/O-2/Ar and C4F8/O-2/Ar + additive gas . The remote plasma source used in the present experiment showed the capability of nearly complete destruction , destruction removal efficiency congruent to100 % , of C4F8 gas with or without the additive N-2 , N2O and NO gas . The cleaning rate of the silicon nitride layer is increased 32-40 % by adding N-2 , N2O and NO gas to the optimized C4F8/O-2 cleaning chemistry . This is presumably due to the effective reaction of NO radical formed in the remote plasma with N on the silicon nitride surface , followed by the effective fluorination of Si atom . As a result , the million metric ton of carbon equivalent value could be effectively reduced due to the decreased emission of CF4 a well a the increased cleaning rate of the silicon nitride layer , comparable to those of NF3/Ar remote plasma cleaning . For the effective reduction of global warming effect , the experimental result indicate a possibility of using the alternative gas such a C4F8 with the N-containing additive gas for the environmentally benign remote plasma cleaning process .

aVRising global carbon dioxide level may lead to profound change in plant composition , regardless of the degree of global warming that may result from the accumulation of this greenhouse gas . We studied the interaction of a CO2 doubling and two level of nitrogen fertilizer on the growth and chemical composition of tall fescue ( Festuca arundinacea Schreber cv . KY-31 ) when infected and uninfected with the mutualistic fungal endophyte Neotyphodium coenophialum Morgan-Jones and Gams . Two-year-old plant were harvested to 5 cm every 4 week , and after 12 week of growth plant grown in twice ambient CO2 concentration : photosynthesized 15 % more ; produced tiller at a faster rate ; produced 53 % more dry matter ( DM ) yield under low N condition and 61 % more DM under high N condition ; the % organic matter ( OM ) wa little changed except under elevated CO2 and high N when % OM increased by 3 % ; lignin decreased by 14 % ; crude protein ( CP ) concentration ( a % DM ) declined by 21 % ; the soluble CP fraction ( a % CP ) increased by 13 % ; the acid detergent insoluble CP fraction ( a % CP ) increased by 12 % , and in vitro neutral detergent fiber digestibility declined by 5 % under high N condition but not under low N. Plants infected with the endophytic fungus : photosynthesized 16 % faster in high N compared with under low N ; flowered earlier than uninfected plant ; had 28 % le lignin in high N compared with under low N ; and had much smaller reduction in CP concentration ( a % DM ) and smaller increase in the soluble CP fraction ( a % CP ) and the acid detergent insoluble CP fraction ( a % CP ) under elevated CO2 . Such large and varied change in plant quality are likely to have large and significant effect on the herbivore population that feed from these plant .

aVDecomposition and mineralisation rate generally increase with increasing moisture and temperature . The expected global climate change may enhance precipitation and raise the temperature at boreal latitude , but absence of snow together with occasional low temperature may cause disturbance in soil process and faunal community . To test the effect of disturbance such a hard frost and freeze-thaw cycle on decomposer population and N mineralisation , we performed two experiment . In the field experiment , carried out in a pine forest , we induced low soil temperature by preventing snow covering the ground . In the laboratory test we established three `` winter '' temperature regime : constant -2degreesC , freeze-thaw cycle of -2degrees to +2degreesC , and the latter with two hard frost period ( -16degreesC ) . The microcosm experiment included two decomposer community ; the `` simple '' community included microbe , protozoa and nematode , and the `` complex '' community microbe , protozoa , nematode , enchytraeids and microarthropods . In the field experiment , the population of enchytraeids and several microarthropod taxon , a well , a microarthropod specie richness , decreased in snowfree plot . In the microcosm , virtually all enchytraeids died and microarthropod population and taxon decreased in the hard frost treatment , but increased in the freeze-thaw treatment . In the laboratory system with simple decomposer community structure the amount of mineral nitrogen decreased in the freeze-thaw treatment . The experiment revealed that exceptionally low soil temperature exert a stronger influence on soil fauna than constant benign temperature or freeze-thaw cycle , but the rapid recovery of population may counteract the detrimental effect of occasional frost period .

aVThe world 's growing human population cause an increasing demand for food , of which rice is one of the most important source . In rice production nitrogen is often a limiting factor . As a consequence increasing amount of fertiliser will have to be applied to maximise yield . There is an ongoing discussion on the possible effect of fertilisation on CH4 emission . We therefore investigated the effect of N-fertiliser ( urea ) on CH4 emission , production and oxidation in rice microcosm and field experiment . In the microcosm , a substantial but short-lived reduction of CH4 emission wa observed after N-addition to 43-d-old rice plant . Methane oxidation increased by 45 % , demonstrated with inhibitor measurement and model calculation based on stable carbon isotope data ( delta ( 13 ) CH4 ) . A second fertilisation applied to 92-d-old plant had no effect on CH4 emission rate . The positive effect of additional N on methanotrophic bacteria wa also found in vitro for potential CH4 oxidation rate in soil and root sample from the microcosm and field experiment , indicated by elevated initial oxidation rate and reduced lag-phases . Fertilisation did not affect methane production in the microcosm . In the field , the effect were diverse : methane production wa inhibited in the topsoil , but stimulated instead in the bulk soil . Stimulation occurred probably in the anaerobic food chain at the level of hydrolytic or fermenting bacteria , because acetate , a methanogenic precursor , increased simultaneously . Combining field , microcosm and laboratory experiment we conclude that any agricultural treatment improving the N-supply to the rice plant will also be favourable for the CH4 oxidising bacteria . However , N-fertilisation had only a transient influence and wa counter-balanced in the field by an elevated CH4 production . A negative effect of the fertilisation wa a transient increase of N-2 O emission from the microcosm . However , integrating over the season the global warming potential ( GWP ) of N-2 O emitted after fertilisation wa still negligible compared to the GWP of emitted CH4 .

aVDuring the 2002 austral summer abnormally high sea-surface temperature ( SST ) occurred in the southern Great Barrier Reef ( GBR ) , Australia . This phenomenon wa accompanied by reduced provisioning , decreased growth rate and reproductive failure of wedge-tailed shearwater in the region . In 2002 , adult were unable to compensate for change in either the availability and/or accessibility of forage-fish by increasing food load or foraging rate . This is one of few study to explicitly correlate decrease in chick provisioning with above-average annual variation in SST and is the first to do so for a tropical seabird specie in the western Pacific . It add to an increasing number of data set identifying the potential negative impact of increasing SST at upper-trophic level . As SST continue to rise with global climate change , our result predict substantial detrimental effect on seabird population of the GBR . This finding ha important implication for both seabird and coral reef ecosystem management in the region . Our result also suggest that wedge-tailed shearwater are sensitive indicator to change in forage-fish availability/accessibility associated with SST variation that can be used to develop model of , and monitor for , these potential impact .

aVOrganic agriculture address the public demand to diminish environmental pollution of agricultural production . Until now , however , only few study tried to determine the integrated environmental impact of conventional versus organic production using life cycle assessment ( LCA ) . The aim of this article wa to review prospect and constraint of LCA a a tool to ass the integrated environmental impact of conventional and organic animal production . This aim wa illustrated using result from LCAs in the literature and from a pilot study comparing conventional and organic milk production . This review show that LCAs of different case study currently can not be compared directly . Such a comparison requires further international standardisation of the LCA method . A within-case-study comparison of LCAs of conventional and organic production , however , appeared suitable to gain knowledge and to track down main difference in potential environmental impact . Acidification potential of milk production , for example , is for 78-97 % due to volatilisation of ammonia , which is not reduced necessarily by changing from conventional to organic milk production . Eutrophication potential per tonne of milk or per ha of farmland wa lower for organic than for conventional milk production due to lower fertiliser application rate . Global warming potential of milk production is for 48-65 % due to emission of methane . Organic milk production inherently increase methane emission and , therefore , can reduce global warming potential only by reducing emission of carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide considerably . Organic milk production reduces pesticide use , whereas it increase land use per tonne of milk . Conclusions regarding potential environmental impact of organic versus conventional milk production , however , are based largely on comparison of experimental farm . To show difference in potential environmental impact among various production system , however , LCAs should be performed at a large number of practical farm for each production system of interest . Application of LCA on practical farm , however , requires in-depth research to understand underlying process , and to predict , or measure , variation in emission realised in practice .

aVAnnual 4th of July Butterfly Count data spanning more than 20 year are examined to explore Vanessa cardui ( Painted Lady ) population fluctuation with ENSO ( El Nino ) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation ( PDO ) index . California , Colorado and Nebraska census exhibit a strong positive correlation with the strong El Nino event of 1982-1983 and 1997-1998 and the weaker event of 1991-1992 . Regression analysis show the population fluctuation are strongly coupled to climate variation on both short ( El Nino ) and longer ( Pacific Decadal Oscillation ) time scale . Recognizing the sensitivity to these time scale is important for predicting longer-term global climate change effect .

aVA life cycle inventory analysis ha been conducted for the production of HFC-134a ( 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane , CH2FCF3 ) ( 1 ) through from basic raw material ( crude oil , natural gas , sulphur and fluorspar ) to the pure product delivered to industrial customer . The analysis wa based on real industrial operation in Japan , USA and UK . It showed that production required limestone , water and transition metal catalyst , in addition to the basic raw material , and that the energy required to provide these raw material in a form that can be used at the plant and to process them through intermediate into HFC-134a is the equivalent of 4.52 tonne of CO2 per tonne of product . Environmental release associated with HFC-134a included waste salt brine ( to the sea ) , mine tailing ( mainly `` country '' rock landfilled at the mine ) and small quantity of calcium sulphate and spent catalyst ( both sent to landfill ) . In addition , greenhouse gas amounting to the equivalent of 2.1 tonne of CO2 per tonne of product were emitted to the atmosphere from the plant studied , an effect very much smaller than that estimated in previous study mainly because the real release rate from current process are very much le than those assumed in prior work . The global warming potential ( 2 ) of HFC-134a is 1300 , meaning that , during the first 100 year following the release of one tonne , the effect on climate change is equivalent to 1300 tonne of carbon dioxide . Consequently , the 6.6 tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent , emitted during production in the form of energy required and other greenhouse gas , is of relatively little importance and the key requirement to reduce environmental impact is containment during use .

aVFrom the viewpoint of preventing global warming and reducing maintenance cost , the reduction of coke consumption in the direct melting furnace for municipal solid waste is strongly called for . Accordingly , the author have developed technology for injecting combustible through the tuyeres of the direct melting furnace . This paper report on the gasification and combustion behavior of combustible injected into coke bed in a high-temperature combustion experiment . The main result obtained are a follows : ( 1 ) Combustibles such a plastic , combustible dust and LPG injected through tuyeres gasify and burn with priority over coke even under the combustion condition of a direct melting furnace that ha no raceway space . ( 2 ) Combustible injection through tuyeres is effective in reducing the coke consumption in the direct melting furnace .

aVReports of malformed amphibian and global amphibian decline have led to public concern , particularly because amphibian are thought to be indicator specie of overall environmental health . The topic also draw scientific attention because there is no obvious , simple answer to the question of what is causing amphibian decline ? Complex interaction of several anthropogenic factor are probably at work , and understanding amphibian decline may thus serve a a model for understanding specie decline in general . While we have fewer answer than we would like , there are six leading hypothesis that we sort into two class . For class I hypothesis , alien specie , over-exploitation and land use change , we have a good understanding of the ecological mechanism underlying decline ; these cause have affected amphibian population negatively for more than a century . However , the question remains a to whether the magnitude of these negative effect increased in the 1980s , a scientist began to notice a global decline of amphibian . Further , remedy for these problem are not simple . For class II hypothesis , global change ( including UV radiation and global climate change ) , contaminant and emerging infectious disease we have a poor , but improving understanding of how each might cause decline . Class II factor involve complex and subtle mechanistic underpinnings , with probable interaction among multiple ecological and evolutionary variable . They may also interact with class I hypothesis . Suspected mechanism associated with class II hypothesis are relatively recent , dating from at least the middle of the 20th century . Did these cause act independently or in concert with pre-existing negative force of class I hypothesis to increase the rate of amphibian decline to a level that drew global attention ? We need more study that connect the suspected mechanism underlying both class of hypothesis with quantitative change in amphibian population size and specie number . An important step forward in this task is clarifying the hypothesis and condition under which the various cause operate alone or together .

aVNational park and bioreserves are key conservation tool used to protect specie and their habitat within the confines of fixed political boundary . This inflexibility may be their `` Achilles ' heel '' a conservation tool in the face of emerging global-scale environmental problem such a climate change . Global climate change , brought about by rising level of greenhouse gas , threatens to alter the geographic distribution of many habitat and their component specie . With these change come great uncertainty about the future ability of park and protected area to meet their conservation mandate . We report here on an analysis aimed at assessing the extent of mammalian specie turnover that may be experienced in eight selected U.S. national park if climate change cause mammalian specie within the continental U.S. to relocate to new geographic location . Due to specie loss of up to 20 % and drastic influx of new specie , national park are not likely to meet their mandate of protecting current biodiversity within park boundary . This approach represents a conservative prognosis . As specie assemblage change , new interaction between specie may lead to le predictable indirect effect of climate change , increasing the toll beyond that found in this study .

aVIn this paper , a new methodology for global estimation of crop productivity is proposed . This methodology integrates Erosion Productivity Impact Calculator ( EPIC ) model with Geographic Information System ( GIS ) and Inference Engine ( IE ) technique . EPIC wa developed by USDA to analyze the relationship between soil erosion and agricultural productivity just at field level . With the integration of GIS , EPIC can be extended to the application of global or regional level . In this integration , IE is developed to determine possible crop combination , the optimum starting and ending date of growth cycle for each crop type and grid cell , in order to ensure best possible crop yield for both rain-fed and irrigated condition . A case of global crop productivity estimation is tested with GIS-based EPIC in 2000 . National average are computed to be comparable to yield in FAO statistic . The comparison indicates that the GIS-based EPIC is able to simulate crop productivity at global level . In addition , with the global climate change data provided by the Intergovernment Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) from the first version of the Canadian Global Coupled Model ( CGCM1 ) , GIS-based EPIC is run for scenario of future climate in the year of 2010 , 2020 , 2030 , 2040 , and 2050 to predict the effect of global warming on main crop yield . Results show the global warming will be harmful for most of the country , and an efficient adaptation to alternative climate tends to reduce the damage . ( C ) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

aVMud volcanism is an abundant , global phenomenon whereby fluid-rich , low-density sediment extrude both on land and offshore . Methane , which generally exceeds 90 vol % of the gas phase , is emitted at high rate during and after emplacement of the mud dome and is known for it high global warming potential ( GWP ) . This comprehensive estimate of the annual contribution of mud volcano degassing ass the significance of mud volcanism for the accumulation of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere . A first-order estimate for the earlier , pre-anthropogenic volume of methane released through mud volcano further support their profound effect on the Earth 's climate since at least the Paleozoic ( 570 Ma ) .

aVA GIS-based RUSLE model is employed to study the global soil erosion potential for viewing the present situation , analysing change over the past century , and projecting future trend with reference to global change in land use and climate . Scenarios considered in the study include historical , present and future condition of cropland and climate . This research give the first overview of the global situation of soil erosion potential considering the previous century a well a the present and future . Present soil erosion potential is estimated to be about 0.38 mm year ( -1 ) for the globe , with Southeast Asia found to be the most seriously affected region in the world . It is estimated that nearly 60 % of present soil erosion are induced by human activity . With development of cropland in the last century , soil erosion potential is estimated to have increased by about 17 % . Global warming might significantly increase the potential for soil erosion , and the region with the same increasing trend of precipitation and population might face much more serious problem related to soil erosion in the future .

aVTo project potential habitat change of 57 fish specie under global warming , their suitable thermal habitat at 764 stream gaging station in the contiguous United States wa studied . Global warming wa specified by air temperature increase projected by the Canadian Centre of Climate Modelling General Circulation Model for a doubling of atmospheric CO2 . The aquatic thermal regime at each gaging station wa related to air temperature using a nonlinear stream temperature/air temperature relationship . Suitable fish thermal habitat wa assumed to be constrained by both maximum temperature and minimum temperature tolerance . For cold water fish with a 0degreesC lower temperature constraint , the number of station with suitable thermal habitat under a 2 x CO2 climate scenario is projected to decrease by 36 % , and for cool water fish by 15 % . These change are associated with a northward shift of the range . For warm water fish with a 2degreesC lower temperature constraint , the potential number of station with suitable thermal habitat is projected to increase by 31 % .

aVWe have analyzed the global tropospheric temperature for 1978 to 2002 with the use of passive microwave sounding data from the NOAA series of polar orbiter and the Earth Observing System Aqua satellite . To accurately retrieve the climatic trend , we combined the satellite data with an analytic model of temperature that contains three different time scale : a linear trend and function that de . ne the seasonal and diurnal cycle . Our analysis show a trend of +0.22degrees to 0.26degreesC per 10 year , consistent with the global warming trend derived from surface meteorological station .

aVThe success of ozone depletion a a social problem is used to examine and understand the relative failure of global warming . Starting with the ( aborted ) 'hot crisis ' of the Greenhouse summer of 1988 , this paper try to show why , despite dire scientific warning , advantage in claims-making , and the perceived emergence of strange weather , global warming consistently obtained lesser outcome . Whereas global warming is a complex and uncertain scientific issue , the ozone hole wa associated and resonated with easy-to-understand bridging metaphor derived from the popular culture . The latter problem not only gave rise to a hot crisis , but wa also caught up in a cultural whirlwind-a rapidly evolving and progressive sequence of dynamic and often surprising event that surge through a variety of public arena with a strong conversational and practical presence . Effectively , ozone loss provided a sense of concrete risk with both strong emotional overtone and everyday relevance for talk and action . Global warming , in contrast , is not amenable to bridging metaphor and did not lend itself to a cultural whirlwind .

aVRecent expansion of Phragmites australis throughout many Great Lakes wetland ha caused concern among resource manager because it is thought to degrade waterfowl habitat and reduce biodiversity . Wetlands at Long Point , Lake Erie , have some of the most important habitat for staging waterfowl on the Great Lakes and anecdotal evidence suggests that Phragmites ha been expanding rapidly in some of these wetland . To make informed management decision , a better understanding of historical change in distribution and abundance of this specie is needed , a well a the ability to identify which plant species/communities Phragmites is replacing . Long Point 's wetland community were digitally mapped from aerial photograph from 1945 to 1999 . The aerial extent of Phragmites stand wa measured by digitizing vegetation boundary , ground-truthing , and analyzing the data using a GIS . A geometric growth formula wa used to determine the intrinsic rate of change of Phragmites over time . Phragmites abundance fluctuated throughout the period ( 1945 : 4 ha ; 1955 : 7.7 ha ; 1964 : 69 ha ; 1968 : 3.6 ha ; 1972 : 15.1 ha ; 1978 : 17.7 ha ; 1985 : < 4 ha ; 1995 : 18 ha ; 1999 : 137 ha ) , but it abundance increased exponentially between 1995 and 1999 ( 137 ha ; intrinsic rate of growth in area = +0.50/yr ) . The species/communities that were most often replaced by Phragmites between 1995 and 1999 were Typha spp . ( 33.8 % ) , marsh meadow ( 31 % ) , sedge/grass hummock ( 10.8 % ) , and other mixed emergents ( 9.6 % ) . Of 31 stand analyzed within the study area , 28 ( 90 % ) were of a non-native strain of Phragmites australis ( haplotype M ) that ha been rapidly expanding throughout the Atlantic region of the United States . We suggest that the recent rapid expansion of Phragmites at Long Point is the direct result of this exotic invasion , and that it ha been facilitated by both decline in Great Lakes water level and increase in ambient air temperature ; anthropogenic and natural disturbance have possibly also contributed . Given the invasive nature of the exotic genotype , combined with future global warming prediction , Phragmites probably will continue to rapidly expand throughout lower Great Lakes coastal wetland .

aV1 . Climate is changing . Predictions are for at least a 3 degreesC rise in mean temperature in northern Europe over the next century . Existing severe impact of nutrient and inappropriate fish stocking in freshwater system remain . 2 . Effects of warming by 3 degreesC above ambient , nutrient addition and the presence or absence of stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus were studied in experimental microcosm dominated by submerged plant , mimicking shallow lake ecosystem . 3 . Warming had considerably smaller effect on the phytoplankton community than did fish and nutrient . It had very minor effect on chlorophyll a and total phytoplankton biovolume . However , it significantly decreased the biovolumes of Cryptophyceae ( a major component in the control ) and Dinophyceae . Contrary to expectation , warming did not increase the abundance of blue-green algae ( cyanophytes ) . Warming decreased the abundance of Cryptomonas erosa ( Cryptophyceae ) and Oocystis pusilla ( Chlorophycota ) and increased those of two other green algae , Tetraedron minimum and Micractinium pusillum . It had no effect on a further 17 specie that were predominant in a community of about 90 specie . 4 . Fish and nutrient , either together or separately , generally increased the crop of most of the 21 abundant specie and of the algal group . Exceptions were for diatom and chrysophytes , which were very minor component of the community . Fish , but neither nutrient nor warming , increased the number of specie of phytoplankton detected . This wa probably through removal of zooplankton grazers , and parallel terrestrial study where the presence of top predator , by controlling herbivore , lead to increased plant diversity . 5 . There wa no particular pattern in the taxonomy or biological characteristic of those specie affected by the treatment . In particular , there wa no link between organism size ( a surrogate for many important biological feature of phytoplankton specie ) and the effect of warming , nutrient addition or presence or absence of fish . However , all specie were relatively small and potentially vulnerable to grazing . 6 . Synthesis and application . The result suggest that fear of an increasing abundance of cyanophytes with current projection of global warming may be unrealized , at least in shallow unstratified lake still dominated by macrophytes . However , they emphasize that eutrophication and fish manipulation remain very important impact factor that determine the abundance of phytoplankton and subsequent problem caused by large growth .

aVClimate change and climate variability affect risk from contaminant by changing exposure to chemical , either through the alteration of pathway or through alteration of environmental concentrating mechanism . The alteration of pathway is affected by changing the balance between transport and deposition . Although the influence of temperature on multimedia partitioning can be modelled successfully , estimating alteration in other climate component such a distribution and form of precipitation provides a much greater challenge . To understand how climate change affect contaminant concentration , we distinguish two type of environmental concentrating processes-solvent switching and solvent depletion . The first process , which is simply chemical partitioning , run spontaneously toward equilibrium . This process alone can explain hemispheric-scale distribution of hexachlorocyclohexane , which partition strongly into water , and high concentration of organochlorines at the bottom of aquatic foodwebs . The latter process involves the maintenance of contaminant burden during the loss of solvent , with the aquatic foodweb providing one of the better-known example . Solvent reducing process can produce contaminant concentration well above thermodynamic equilibrium with a number of important example provided by phase change in water ( freezing , snow melting ) . These solvent-reducing process , which are poorly studied , provide some of the best circumstance for climate change to produce alteration in persistent organic pollutant exposure pathway .

aVThe influence of the Laurentian Great Lakes on the climate of surrounding region is significant , especially in leeward setting where lake-effect snowfall occurs . Heavy lake-effect snow represents a potential natural hazard and play important role in winter recreational activity , agriculture , and regional hydrology . Changes in lake-effect snowfall may represent a regional-scale manifestation of hemispheric-scale climate change , such a that associated with global warming . This study examines record of snowfall from several lake-effect and non-lake-effect site throughout most of the twentieth century in order to 1 ) determine whether difference in snowfall trend exist between these setting and 2 ) offer possible linkage between lake-effect snow trend and record of air temperature , water temperature , and ice cover . A new , historic record of oxygen isotope [ delta ( 18 ) O ( ( CaCO3 ) ) ] data from the sediment of three eastern Finger Lakes in central New York is presented a a mean of independently assessing change in Great Lakes lake-effect snowfall . Results reveal a statistically significant increasing trend in snowfall for the lake-effect site , whereas no trend is observed in the non-lake-effect setting . The Finger Lake oxygen isotope record reflects this increase in lake-effect snow through a statistically significant trend toward lower delta ( 18 ) O ( ( CaCO3 ) ) value . Records of air temperature , water temperature , and lake ice suggest that the observed lake-effect snow increase during the twentieth century may be the result of warmer Great Lakes surface water and decreased ice cover , both of which are consistent with the historic upward trend in Northern Hemispheric temperature due to global warming . Given projected increase in future global temperature , area downwind of the Great Lakes may experience increased lake-effect snowfall for the foreseeable future .

aVThe Koppen climate classification wa applied to the observed gridded climatological set and the output of four general circulation model ( GCMs ) over the continent of the Earth . All data had been acquired via the Data Distribution Centre established by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change . The ability of the GCMs to simulate the Koppen climate zone identified in the real data wa explored and possible future ( global warming ) change in the climate type ' distribution for each GCM were assessed . Differences in the area distribution derived from the GCMs ' recent climate simulation give evidence about uncertainty generally involved in climate model . As to the global warming simulation , all GCM projection of warming climate ( horizon 2050 ) show that the zone representing tropical rain climate and dry climate become larger , and the zone identified with boreal forest and snow climate together with the polar climate are smaller .

aVMilankovitch-scale cycle can be recognized in high-resolution delta ( 13 ) C , delta ( 18 ) O , Sr/Ca , mineralogical , and magnetic susceptibility data in hemipelagic sediment that span the last 700 kyr of the Maastrichtian at Elles , Tunisia . Oxygen isotope data reveal three cool period between 65.50 and 65.55 Ma ( 21.5-23.5 m ) , 65.26 and 65.33 Ma ( 8-11 in ) , and 65.04 and 65.12 Ma ( 1.5-4 m ) , and three warm period between 65.33 and 65.38 Ma ( 12-16 m ) , 65.12 and 65.26 Ma ( 4-8 in ) , and 65.00 and 65.04 Ma ( 0-1.5 m ) . The cool period are characterized by small surface-to-deep temperature gradient that reflect intensive mixing of the water column . The surface-to-deep Sr/Ca gradient generally correlate with the oscillating AT trend ( temperature difference between surface and bottom water ) . The carbon isotope composition of planktonic foraminifera indicates a continuous decrease in surface bioproductivity during Late Maastrichtian . Decreasing Delta ( 13 ) C value ( difference between the delta ( 13 ) C value of surface and bottom dwelling foraminifera ) and the carbon isotope ratio of the planktonic specie at the onset of gradual warming at 65.50 Ma reflect a reduction in surface productivity a a result of decreased upwelling that accompanied global warming and possibly increased atmospheric pCO ( 2 ) , related to Deccan Trap volcanism . Time series analysis applied to magnetic susceptibility , delta ( 18 ) O , and Sr/Ca data identifies the 20 kyr precession , 40 kyr obliquity , and 100 kyr eccentricity Milankovich cycle .

aVThe environmental performance of willow biomass crop production system in New York ( NY ) is analyzed using life cycle assessment ( LCA ) methodology . The base-case , which represents current practice in NY , produce 55 unit of biomass energy per unit of fossil energy consumed over the biomass crop 's 23-year lifetime . Inorganic nitrogen fertilizer input have a strong influence on overall system performance , accounting for 37 % of the non-renewable fossil energy input into the system . Net energy ratio varies from 58 to below 40 a a function of fertilizer application rate , but application rate also ha implication on the system nutrient balance . Substituting inorganic N fertilizer with sewage sludge biosolids increase the net energy ratio of the willow biomass crop production system by more than 40 % . While CO2 emitted in combusting dedicated biomass is balanced by CO2 adsorbed in the growing biomass , production process contribute to the system 's net global warming potential . Taking into account direct and indirect fuel use , N2O emission from applied fertilizer and leaf litter , and carbon sequestration in below ground biomass and soil carbon , the net greenhouse gas emission total 0.68 g CO2 eq . MJ ( biomass produced ) ( -1 ) . Site specific parameter such a soil carbon sequestration could easily offset these emission resulting in a net reduction of greenhouse gas . Assuming reasonable biomass transportation distance and energy conversion efficiency , this study implies that generating electricity from willow biomass crop could produce 11 unit of electricity per unit of fossil energy consumed . Results from the LCA support the assertion that willow biomass crop are sustainable from an energy balance perspective and contribute additional environmental benefit .

aV[ 1 ] Global power law scaling of near surface temperature spectrum is determined in two scenario simulation and in NCEP re-analyses . The simulation use the coupled atmosphere-ocean model HadCM3 and ECHAM4/OPYC with greenhouse gas increase according to scenario IS92a in 1860-2099 . Observations show a low-frequency power spectrum S ( f ) similar to 1/f over the ocean , a white spectrum in the inner continent , and S ( f ) similar to f ( -0.3 ) in the coastal area . The global distribution of the power law exponent is reproduced in the two simulation even in the 21st century with a pronounced temperature increase .

aVGeographic and ecological distribution of three Lutzomyia sand fly that are cutaneous leishmaniasis vector in South America were analysed using ecological niche modelling . This new tool provides a large-scale perspective on specie ' geographic distribution , ecological and historical factor determining them , and their potential for change with expected environmental change . As a first step , the ability of this technique to predict geographic distribution of the three specie wa tested statistically using two subsampling technique : a random-selection technique that simulates 50 % data density , and a quadrant-based technique that challenge the method to predict into broad unsampled region . Predictivity under both test scheme wa highly statistically significant . Visualisation of ecological niche provided insight into the ecological basis for distributional difference among specie . Projections of potential geographic distribution across scenario of global climate change suggested that only Lutzomyia whitmani is likely to be experiencing dramatic improvement in condition in south-eastern Brazil , where cutaneous leishmaniasis appears to be re-emerging ; Lutzomyia intermedia and Lutzomyia migonei may be seeing more subtle improvement in climatic condition , but the implication are not straightforward . More generally , this technique offer the possibility of new view into the distributional ecology of disease , vector , and reservoir specie . ( C ) 2003 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc .

aVAccurate prediction of change in the relative elevation of coastal marsh surface ha gained considerable importance in light of global-warming-induced sea-level rise . Shallow autocompaction is an important component of elevation change that act to decrease relative elevation . Unlike vertical accretion , which can be determined from repeated survey of artificial marker horizon , autocompaction is difficult to measure . This report present the result of a preliminary study that us cesium-137 dating and down-core measurement of sediment bulk density to numerically model vertical accretion , shallow autocompaction and surface elevation change . The model produce vertical accretion rate that are comparable to rate derived from artificial marker horizon , and long-term surface elevation change that are in close agreement with sedimentation rate based on cesium-137 dating of well-compacted sediment . The model result suggest that average annual vertical accretion may be higher than average annual surface elevation change by a factor of 1.6 to 21 . Sedimentation rate derived from cesium-137 dating also are higher than average annual surface elevation change by a factor of 1.1 to 4.7 . These finding suggest that sedimentation rate based on cesium-137 dating will tend to be lower than vertical accretion and higher than long-term surface elevation change . The result of the study re-emphasize the importance of fully accounting for shallow autocompaction when attempting to predict marsh surface elevation change .

aVA simple model based on the `` big leaf '' assumption and calibrated with field eco-physiological measure of gas exchange is used to simulate the effect of temperature increase on net primary production , total canopy transpiration and the dimensionless decoupling coefficient Omega of Holm oak forest . Two different annual average air temperature : 14.6 and 18.0degreesC are considered , they are respectively the average current temperature and the one expected in the next 50 year in the Mediterranean area if the trend of global warming will continue . The model simulates the behaviour of the three parameter by assuming no change in the effect of water constraint at both the temperature . The model ha been implemented by STELLA ( ( R ) ) II software . According to the model , the increase of air temperature affect both the net primary productivity ( 6.3 % ) and the water loss by canopy transpiration ( 37.2 % ) . The model predicts an average decoupling factor , Omega , of about 0.26 at both temperature of 14.6 and 18.0degreesC . This value is in the range between Heathlands and Forest , suggesting that at the average annual temperature of 18.0degreesC the Holm oak forest will start to respond in a similar way to more xeric plant community .

aVThe time-series of all available record of seasonal and annual glacier mass balance , equilibrium line altitude , accumulation area ratio and change in surface area of about 300 glacier have been compiled , digitized , quality checked and analyzed over the period of almost four decade ( 1961 - 1998 ) . These time-series show significant change towards loss in glacier area and volume in global scale with accelerated rate , especially since the end of 1980 's . The remarkable feature in this change is the increase of both winter and summer balance , which implies that glacier are intensifying the water cycle in time of global warming . The sensitivity of glacier mass balance in regard to temperature and precipitation ha also increased which resulted in an increase of glacier contribution to sea level rise from 0.15 mm/yr in 1961 - 1976 ( 10 % of total sea-level rise ) to 0.41 mm/yr in 1988 - 1998 ( 27 % of total sea-level rise ) . Glacier contribution to the ocean ha the potential to grow due to increasing snow accumulation and involving into the water cycle larger area of individual glacier around the Antarctic ice sheet .

aVNormalisation provides a measure of the relative contribution from a product system to one or more environmental problem . Total yearly emission for a reference year in a reference region are normally used to calculate normalisation figure . This paper provides up-to-date normalisation figure for the Netherlands in 1997/1998 , Western Europe in 1995 and the world in 1990 and 1995 . Impact category considered were depletion of abiotic resource , land competition , global warming , stratospheric ozone depletion , acidification , eutrophication , photochemical ozone formation , radiation and toxicity . In all case , a limited set of emission or extraction are dominant contributor to the normalisation score . Although much effort wa spent on collecting emission data and characterisation factor , particularly normalisation score for radiation and toxicity remain considerably uncertain .

aVExtreme rainfall event recently occurring in Korea have been shown to change frequency-based rainfall amount quite significantly . Regardless of the reason for these extreme , the general concern of most hydrologist is how to handle these event for practical application in Hydrology . Our study aim is to evaluate these extreme with their effect on frequency-based rainfall amount , especially if they can be assumed to be within normal level . As there is no commonly accepted methodology to be applied to this kind of study , we follow simplified step such a : ( 1 ) estimation of the climatological variance of frequency-based rainfall amount , ( 2 ) estimation of confidence interval of frequency-based rainfall amount ( lower and upper bound for the 5 and 1 % significance level estimated using the climatological variance ) , and ( 3 ) evaluation of the effect of extra rainfall event on the frequency-based rainfall amount . Twelve station on the Korean peninsula are selected a they have relatively longer data length . The annual maximum rainfall data collected from 1954 to 1998 are used . From this study we concluded that ( 1 ) at least 30 year of data length should be used for the frequency analysis in order to assure the stability of the variance of frequency-based rainfall amount , ( 2 ) the climatological variance estimated all range from 5 to 8 % of the frequency-based rainfall amount , and ( 3 ) even though the frequency-based rainfall amount seems to become extreme with seemingly abnormal event , it still remains under it upper bound for the 5 or 1 % significance level estimated using the climatological variance , a well a it decay exponentially to the normal level a extra event are added . Thus , we conclude that we do not need to panic over seemingly abnormal event occurring so far , but just need to consider the variability inherent in frequency-based rainfall amount .

aVPalaeoclimatic data document a sensitive climate system subject to large and perhaps difficult-to-predict abrupt change . These data suggest that neither the sensitivity nor the variability of the climate are fully captured in some climate-change projection , such a the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) Summary for Policyrnakers . Because larger , faster and less-expected climate change can cause more problem for economy and ecosystem , the palaeoclimatic data suggest the hypothesis that the future may be more challenging than anticipated in ongoing policy making . Large change have occurred repeatedly with little net forcing . Increasing carbon dioxide concentration appears to have globalized deglacial warming , with climate sensitivity near the upper end of value from general circulation model ( GCMs ) used to project human-enhanced greenhouse warming ; data from the warm Cretaceous period suggest a similarly high climate sensitivity to CO2 . Abrupt climate change of the most recent glacial-interglacial cycle occurred during warm a well a cold time , linked especially to changing North Atlantic freshwater flux . GCMs typically project greenhouse-gas-induced North Atlantic freshening and circulation change with notable but not extreme consequence ; however , such model often underestimate the magnitude , speed or extent of past change . Targeted research to ass model uncertainty would help to test these hypothesis .

aVUnderstanding the nature and extent of methane production and flux in aquatic sediment ha important geochemical , geotechnical , and global climate change implication . Quantifying these process is difficult , because much of the methane flux in shallow sediment occurs via ebullition ( bubbling ) . Direct observation of bubble formation is not possible , and bubbling is episodic and dependent upon a number of factor . Whereas previous study have correlated methane flux with surface wind intensity , detailed study of Lake Gatun in Panama and Lago Loiza in Puerto Rico suggest that methane flux is more closely correlated with the shear stress in sediment caused by bottom current . Bottom current in turn are a complex function of wind , internal pressure gradient , and lake bathymetry . A simple physical model of bottom current and sediment in these lake suggests that most methane ebullition originated from the upper 10-20 cm of the sediment column . Our data reaffirm previous study showing that ebullitive methane flux is minor in water deeper than similar to5 m .

aVAtlantic cod Gadus morhua ha polymorphic haemoglobin , which can be separated into two homozygous type , HbI-1 and HbI-2 , and one heterozygous type HbI-1/2 . The geographical distribution of Atlantic cod with the different haemoglobin type varies , with the HbI ( 2 ) allele occurring at high frequency in northern region , and the HbI ( 1 ) allele dominant in warmer area . To determine if temperature is a selective parameter in the distribution of the haemoglobin type , the preferred temperature of the homozygous genotype HbI-1 and HbI-2 wa measured . We found that HbI-2 cod preferred a temperature of 8.2+/-1.5degreesC while HbI-1 cod preferred 15.4+/-1.1degreesC , and this preference wa significant . The effect of hypoxia ( 35 % oxygen saturation ) on the preferred temperature wa also measured . Previous study showed that the preferred temperature of fish decrease during hypoxia , and this wa the case for HbI-1 cod , which preferred 9.8+/-1.8degreesC during hypoxia , whereas HbI-2 cod did not show this effect . The result indicate that environmental temperature change will lead to a distributional change in the different haemoglobin type of Atlantic cod , global warming providing an advantage for HbI-1 cod . However , since HbI-1 cod prefer a low temperature under hypoxic condition , a combination of increased water temperature and hypoxia could be unfavourable for Atlantic cod stock .

aVThe objective of this study wa to ass the radiative forcing due to Finnish anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission in three scenario . All the Kyoto Protocol gas , i.e. , CO2 , CH4 , N2O , and fluorinated gas , were included . The calculation showed that forcing due to Finnish emission will increase in the case of all gas except methane by the year 2100 . In 1990 , radiative forcing due to Finland 's emission history of all Kyoto Protocol gas wa 3.2 mW/m ( 2 ) , of which 71 % wa due to carbon dioxide , 17 % to methane , and the rest to nitrous oxide . In 1990 the share of fluorinated gas wa negligible . The share of methane in radiative forcing is decreasing , whereas the share of carbon dioxide and of fluorinated gas are increasing and that of nitrous oxide remains nearly constant . The nonlinear feature concerning additional concentration in the atmosphere and radiative forcing due to emission caused by a single country or activity are also considered . Radiative forcing due to Finnish emission wa assessed with two different approach , the marginal forcing approach and the averaged forcing approach . The impact of the so-called background scenario , i.e. , the scenario for concentration caused by global emission , wa also estimated . The difference between different forcing model at it highest wa 40 % , and the averaged forcing approach appeared to be the more recommendable . The effect of background concentration in the studied case wa up to 11 % . Hence , the choice of forcing model and background scenario should be given particular attention .

aVAlong the main boundary fault of the central Tibetan Shuang flu graben , two well-preserved fluvial terrace surface are vertically offset by similar to1.3 m ( terrace 1 ) and similar to14.8 m ( terrace 11 ) . Using thermal ionization mass spectrometry ( TIMS ) , we have determined 48 Th-230-U-234-U-238 age of small ( 10-40 mg ) sample from pedogenic carbonate rind on clast in the terrace deposit . Based on textural , microstratigraphic and geochemical criterion , we conclude that the U-series age of innermost-rind sample provide reliable age of 16.4 +/- 1.9 ka for terrace 1 , and 233.1 +/- 9.3 ka for terrace II . This constrains the average rate of vertical displacement along the normal fault to be 0.079 +/- 0.011 mm/yr during the past similar to16 kyr , and 0.064 +/- 0.007 mm/yr during the past similar to233 kyr . Combining these result with slip-rate estimate for other normal fault along the graben margin indicates that the cumulative vertical displacement on all normal fault did not exceed similar to0.3 mm/yr during the late Quaternary . This new rate from central Tibet is distinctly lower than the rate of 1.9 +/- 0.6 mm/yr inferred for normal fault bounding the Yadong-Gulu graben system in southern Tibet , consistent with more pronounced and common graben development in southern Tibet . We therefore suggest that normal faulting in southern Tibet is largely controlled by local process , and that the age of it initiation is not a valid proxy for uplift of the Tibetan plateau , a ha been widely assumed . Our data also place chronologic constraint on the termination of periglacial condition in central Tibet during the last three interglaciations . Rind formation appears to have been relatively continuous on clast in terrace I from similar to16 ka . Clast rind from terrace 11 , in contrast , are characterized by three main episode of rind growth that are widely separated in time . The earliest and least well-preserved episode started at 233.1 +/- 9.3 ka , a second episode occurred at 131.8 +/- 7.8 ka , and a third episode wa approximately coeval with rind formation in terrace I after 16.4 +/- 1.9 ka . In each case , the age of onset of carbonate rind accumulation coincides with independently estimated age of global deglaciation . Accordingly , we conclude that periglacial condition in the central Tibetan plateau terminated synchronously with early stage of global warming following the last three glacial maximum , and that fluvial aggradation , terrace formation , and pedogenic carbonate accumulation in terrace soil ensued rapidly .

aVGlobal climate change is fundamentally caused by fossil fuel combustion . The transportation sector generates more than one-third of greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emission in New York and represents the fastest-growing source of GHG emission in the state . A summary of the recommendation of the New York Greenhouse Gas Task Force for reducing GHG emission from the transportation sector is provided . Using a bottom-up analytical approach , the Center for Clean Air Policy-with advice from the task force-determined that New York can reduce transportation-sector emission by 1.64 million metric ton of carbon equivalent ( MMTCE ) in 2010 ( total emission 20.9 % above 1990 level ) and by 5.23 MMTCE in 2020 ( total emission 16.5 % above 1990 level ) by implementing the task force 's recommendation . Achieving significant reduction in GHG emission from transportation requires a comprehensive package of complementary measure , including shifting funding to more GHG-efficient alternative such a transit and smart growth , adopting GHG emission standard for light-duty vehicle ( upon implementation in California ) , creating an indigenous biofuels program , and considering policy mechanism to increase freight efficiency and high-speed rail option . To facilitate the implementation of these measure , the establishment of a state entity for reducing transportation-sector emission is recommended with a goal of reducing transportation GHG emission to 20 % above 1990 level by 2010 , 10 % above 1990 level by 2020 , and 1990 level by 2030 .

aVPerfluorocompounds ( PFCs ) , which have long lifetime and serious global warming implication , are widely used during plasma etching and plasma-assisted chamber cleaning process in metal and dielectric film , by chemical vapor deposition ( CVD ) system . Surface cleaning are performed within a reduced pressure chamber by making use of PFC gas . These contaminant gas are emitted with nitrogen gas , which are used for vacuum pump purge . In order to destroy all of the global warming gas including PFCs , we have developed a plasma abatement device , an electrodeless atmospheric microwave plasma-torch , which can easily generate plasma at a given atmospheric pressure . The plasma abatement device is attached to the vacuum pump , which discharge the nitrogen gas with contaminant . The abatement wa carried out using oxygen and air a additive gas .

aVClimate change impact assessment conventionally ass just the implication of a change in mean climate due to global warming . This paper compare such effect of such change with those due to natural multi-decadal variability , and also explores the effect of changing the year-to-year variability in climate a well a the mean . It estimate change in mean monthly flow and a measure of low flow ( the flow exceeded 95 % of , the time ) in six catchment in Britain , Using the UKCIP98 climate change scenario and a calibrated hydrological model . Human-induced climate change ha a different seasonal effect on flow than natural multi-decadal variability ( an increase in winter and decrease in summer ) , and by the 2050s the climate change signal is apparent in winter and , in lowland Britain , in summer . Superimposing natural multidecadal variability onto the human-induced climate change increase substantially the range in possible future streamflows ( in some instance counteracting the climate change signal ) , with important implication for the development of adaptation strategy . Increased year-to-year variability in climate lead to slight increase in mean monthly flow ( relative to change due just to change in mean climate ) , and slightly greater decrease in low flow . The greatest effect on low flow occurs in upland catchment . ( C ) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All right reserved .

aVThe present study is an assessment of a two-member ensemble of transient climate change simulation , with a focus on the Indian summer monsoon and ENSO-monsoon teleconnection . The CNRM ocean-atmosphere coupled model is integrated from 1950 to 2099 and driven by change in concentration of greenhouse gas and sulfate aerosol . The simulated monsoon climate is first validated against available observation and NCEP/NCAR reanalyses over the second half of the 20 ( th ) century . The model capture the main feature of the Indian monsoon climate and the main mode of variability found in the tropical region , namely the El Nino Southern Oscillation , reasonably well . During the second half of the 21 ( st ) century , both scenario indicate a significant increase in the annual mean surface air temperature ( about 2degreesC ) and in monsoon precipitation ( le than 10 % ) over India , relative to the 1950-1999 climatology . However , the model doe not show a clear strengthening of the monsoon circulation , but rather a northward shift of the westerly monsoon flow . The increase in monsoon precipitation is therefore partly due to a 'non-dynamical ' response to global warming , namely a large increase in precipitable water over India . While the transient response of the model show a qualitative agreement with the surface warming observed over recent decade , neither the observation nor the model indicate significant trend in All India monsoon rainfall in the late 20th century . A long-term increase in simulated monsoon precipitation doe appear from 1950 to 2099 , but is superimposed onto relatively large multi-decadal fluctuation . The simulated ENSO-monsoon teleconnection also show a strong modulation on multi-decadal time scale , but no systematic change with increasing amount of greenhouse gas .

aVEnvironmental physiology is the study of the physiological mechanism that allow animal to cope with and adapt to change in temperature , humidity , atmospheric pressure , and other natural factor of their physical environment . Nearly all toxicological and pharmacological study are performed in resting ( i.e. , nonexercising ) experimental animal acclimatized to standard environmental condition that are usually considered ideal to the animal 's physiological well-being . These ideal test condition are clearly not representative of the fluctuation in the natural environment encountered by human and other animal on a day-to-day basis . It behooves the toxicologist , especially those interested in extrapolating experimental data from laboratory animal to human , to consider how variation in the natural environment will alter physiological response to toxicant . Temperature and exercise are the two most well-studied parameter in the field of environmental physiology and toxicology . In general , high temperature exacerbate the toxic effect of many environmental toxicant . Moreover , exercising subject are generally more vulnerable to airborne toxic agent . The prospect of global warming also warrant a better assessment of how higher environmental temperature may impact on the response of human and other specie to toxic chemical . Hence , this paper and accompanying paper from the proceeding of a symposium focus on the salient aspect of the interaction between environmental stress and physiological response to toxic agent with particular emphasis on temperature and exercise .

aVIn developing red data book of threatened specie , the World Conservation Union us measure of rarity , rate of decline , and population fragmentation to categorize specie according to their risk of extinction . However , most quantitative measure of these three concept are sensitive to the scale at which they are made . In particular , definition of rarity based on an area-of-occupancy threshold can nearly always be met if area of occupancy is calculated from a sufficiently fine-scale ( high-resolution ) grid . Recommendations for dealing with scale dependency include ( 1 ) choosing a standard scale of measurement , ( 2 ) using multiple scale of measurement , and ( 3 ) developing index that combine information from multiple scale . As an example of the second and third approach , the construction of a specie ' scale-area curve represents a unifying method for quantifying all three indicator of extinction risk-rarity , rate of decline , and population fragmentation-as function of area of occupancy and measurement scale . A multiscale analysis is also of practical importance because measurement made at different scale are relevant to different extinction process . Coarse-scale measure of rarity are most appropriate when threat is assessed on the basis of spatially autocorrelated event of a large extent , such a global climate change , whereas fine-scale measure may best predict extinction risk due to local process such a demographic stochasticity . We illustrate our argument with a case study of the British distribution of two related plant specie that show a 200-fold reversal in their relative rarity when measured at different scale .

aVIn this paper , we applied the newest emission scenario of the sulfur and greenhouse gas , i.e . Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) Special Report on Emission Scenarios ( SRES ) A2 and B2 scenario , to investigating the change of the East Asian climate in the last three decade of the 21st century with an atmosphere-ocean coupled general circulation model . The global warming enlarges the land-sea thermal contrast and , hence , enhances ( reduces ) the East Asian summer ( winter ) monsoon circulation . The precipitation from the Yangtze and Huaihe river valley to North China increase significantly . In particular , the strong rainfall increase over North China implies that the East Asian rainy area would expand northward . In addition , from the southeastern coastal area to North China , the rainfall would increase significantly in September , implying that the rainy period of the East Asian monsoon would be prolonged about one month . In July , August and September , the inter-annual variability of the precipitation enhances evidently over North China , meaning a risk of flooding in the future .

aVEnsemble experiment with a global coupled climate model are performed for the twentieth century with time-evolving solar , greenhouse gas , sulfate aerosol ( direct effect ) , and ozone ( tropospheric and stratospheric ) forcing . Observed global warming in the twentieth century occurred in two period , one in the early twentieth century from about the early 1900s to the 1940s , and one later in the century from , roughly , the late 1960s to the end of the century . The model 's response requires the combination of solar and anthropogenic forcing to approximate the early twentieth-century warming , while the radiative forcing from increasing greenhouse gas is dominant for the response in the late twentieth century , confirming previous study . Of particular interest here is the model 's amplification of solar forcing when this act in combination with anthropogenic forcing . This difference is traced to the fact that solar forcing is more spatially heterogeneous ( i.e. , acting most strongly in area where sunlight reach the surface ) while greenhouse gas forcing is more spatially uniform . Consequently , solar forcing is subject to coupled regional feedback involving the combination of temperature gradient , circulation regime , and cloud . The magnitude of these feedback depends on the climate 's base state . Over relatively cloud-free oceanic region in the subtropics , the enhanced solar forcing produce greater evaporation . More moisture then converges into the precipitation convergence zone , intensifying the regional monsoon and Hadley and Walker circulation , causing cloud reduction over the subtropical ocean region , and , hence , more solar input . An additional response to solar forcing in northern summer is an enhancement of the meridional temperature gradient due to greater solar forcing over land region that contribute to stronger West African and South Asian monsoon . Since the greenhouse gas are more spatially uniform , such regional circulation feedback are not a strong . These regional response are most evident when the solar forcing occurs in concert with increased greenhouse gas forcing . The net effect of enhanced solar forcing in the early twentieth century is to produce larger solar-induced increase of tropical precipitation when calculated a a residual than for early century solar-only forcing , even though the size of the imposed solar forcing is the same . As a consequence , overall precipitation increase in the early twentieth century in the Asian monsoon region are greater than late century increase , qualitatively consistent with observed trend in all-India rainfall . Similar effect occur in West Africa , the tropical Pacific , and the Southern Ocean tropical convergence zone .

aVThe hypothesis of the South Pacific origin of the decadal ( 7-35 year ) ENSO-like variation is investigated based on 200-year output of the ECHAM4/OPA/OASIS coupled GCM . Associated with the decadal warm ( cold ) SST anomaly in the tropical Pacific , an anomalous cyclonic ( anticyclonic ) circulation , which is tilted in a southeast-northwest direction , appears in the South Pacific . This result in anomalous upward ( downward ) Ekman pumping along the northeastern edge of the anomalous circulation and , hence , shallowing ( deepening ) the oceanic thermocline there . Such an external source of heat content tends to slowly discharge/recharge the tropical ocean on the decadal timescale . The above result is consistent with the observational study of Luo and Yamagata [ 2001 ] . Besides , the model reproduces amazingly a high lagged-correlation between the global land surface temperature and the decadal Nino3 SST . Despite the model bias , this suggests a potential prediction skill of the global warming based on the ENSO-like decadal variation .

aVChanges in forest structure were examined 10-15 month after an unprecedented understorey wildfire burnt previously undisturbed primary forest in central Brazilian Amazonia , following the severe 1997-1998 El Nino dry season . On the basis of 20 0.25 ha plot ( 10 m x 250 m ) in both burnt and unburnt forest , we found marked difference in the overall live biomass , canopy openness and understorey vegetation . On average , 36 % of all tree equal to or greater than 10 cm DBH were found to be dead in the burnt forest , and there wa also a near-complete mortality in all pre-burn sapling . Using an allometric equation to predict biomass mortality we estimate that the tree mortality rate found would commit an additional 25.5 t C/ha to be released from these BFs . The dramatic increase of aboveground dead biomass in BF is of major global concern because of the increased flux Of CO2 to the atmosphere , which ha a role in enhancing the greenhouse effect and promoting climate change .

aVThis article considers an important aspect of the general sequential analysis problem where a process is in control up to some unknown point i = v - 1 , after which the distribution from which the observation are generated change . An extensive sequential analytic literature assumes that the change in distribution is abrupt , for example , from N ( 0 , 1 ) to N ( mu , 1 ) . There is also an extensive literature that deal with a gradual change in the case where the decision ( whether or not a change ha occurred ) is based on a fixed set of observation , rather than an ongoing process of decision making every time a new observation is obtained . However , there is virtually no literature on the practical case of sequentially detecting a gradual change in distribution ( visualize a machine deteriorating gradually ) . This article considers solution to this problem . As a first approximation , the gradual change problem can be modeled a a change from a fixed distribution to a-model of simple linear regression with respect to time ( i.e. , there is an abrupt change of slope , from a 0 to a nonzero slope ) . We study an extension of this case to a general context of sequential detection of a change in the slope of a simple linear regression . The residual are assumed to be normally distributed . We consider both the case in which the baseline parameter are known and the case in which they are not . Finally , a an application , we monitor for an increase in the rate of global warming .

aVThis paper applies the newest emission scenario of the sulfur and greenhouse gas , namely IPCC SRES A2 and B2 scenario , to investigate the change of the North China climate with an atmosphere-ocean coupled general circulation model . In the last three decade of the 21st century , the global warming enlarges the land-sea thermal contrast , and hence , cause the East Asian summer ( winter ) monsoon circulation to be strengthened ( weakened ) . The rainfall seasonality strengthens and the summer precipitation increase significantly in North China . It is suggested that the East Asian rainy area would expand northward to North China in the last three decade of the 21st century . In addition , the North China precipitation would increase significantly in September . In July , August , and September , the interannual variability of the precipitation enlarges evidently over North China , implying a risk of flooding in the future .

aVFrom a societal , weather , and climate perspective , precipitation intensity , duration , frequency , and phase are a much of concern a total amount , a these factor determine the disposition of precipitation once it hit the ground and how much run off . At the extreme of precipitation incidence are the event that give rise to flood and drought , whose change in occurrence and severity have an enormous impact on the environment and society . Hence , advancing understanding and the ability to model and predict the character of precipitation is vital but requires new approach to examining data and model . Various mechanism , storm and so forth , exist to bring about precipitation . Because the rate of precipitation , conditional on when it fall , greatly exceeds the rate of replenishment of moisture by surface evaporation , most precipitation come from moisture already in the atmosphere at the time the storm begin , and transport of moisture by the storm-scale circulation into the storm is vital . Hence , the intensity of precipitation depends on available moisture , especially for heavy event . As climate warms , the amount of moisture in the atmosphere , which is governed by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation , is expected to rise much faster than the total precipitation amount , which is governed by the surface heat budget through evaporation . This implies that the main change to be experienced are in the character of precipitation : increase in intensity must be offset by decrease in duration or frequency of event . The timing , duration , and intensity of precipitation can be systematically explored via the diurnal cycle , whose correct simulation in model remains an unsolved challenge of vital importance in global climate change . Typical problem include the premature initiation of convection , and precipitation event that are too light and too frequent . These challenge in observation , modeling , and understanding precipitation change are being taken up in the NCAR `` Water Cycle Across Scales '' initiative , which will exploit the diurnal cycle a a test bed for a hierarchy of model to promote improvement in model .

aVThe effect of climate change on global potato production wa assessed . Potential yield were calculated with a simulation model and a grid with monthly climate data for current ( 1961-1990 ) and projected ( 2010-2039 and 2040-2069 ) condition . The result were mapped and summarized for country . Between 1961-1990 and 20402069 the global ( terrestrial excluding Antarctica ) average temperature is predicted to increase between 2.1 and 3.2 C , depending on the climate scenario . The temperature increase is smaller when change are weighted by the potato area and particularly when adaptation of planting time and cultivar is considered ( a predicted temperature increase between 1 and 1.4 C ) . For this period , global potential potato yield decrease by 18 % to 32 % ( without adaptation ) and by 9 % to 18 % ( with adaptation ) . At high latitude , global warming will likely lead to change in the time of planting , the use of later-maturing cultivar , and a shift of the location of potato production . In many of these region , change in potato yield are likely to be relatively small , and sometimes positive . Shifting planting time or location is le feasible at lower latitude , and in these region global warming could have a strong negative effect on potato production . It is shown that heat-tolerant potato cultivar could be used to mitigate effect of global warming in ( sub ) tropical region .

aVAccording to the United Nations , global fertility ha declined in the last century a reflected by a decline in birth rate . The earth 's surface air temperature ha increased considerably and is referred to a global warming . Since change in temperature are well known to influence fertility we sought to determine if a statistical relationship exists between long-term change in global air temperature and birth rate . The most complete and reliable birth rate data in the 20th century wa available in 19 industrialized country . Using bivariate and multiple regression analysis , we compared yearly birth rate from these country to global air temperature from 1900 to 1994 . A common pattern of change in birth rate wa noted for the 19 industrialized country studied . In general , birth rate declined markedly throughout the century except during the baby boom period of approximately 1940 to 1964 . An inverse relationship wa found between change in global temperature and birth rate in all 19 country . Controlling for the linear yearly decline in birth rate over time , this relationship remained statistically significant for all the 19 country in aggregate and in seven country individually ( p < 0.05 ) . Conclusions . The result of our analysis are consistent with the underlying premise that temperature change affect fertility and suggests that human fertility may have been influenced by change in environmental temperature .

aVMounting evidence indicates that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation ( AMOC ) wa strongly reduced during cold climate episode in the past , possible due to freshwater influx from glacial melting . It is also expected that the freshwater input to high northern latitude will increase a human-induced global warming continues , with potential impact on the AMOC . Here we present result from a 150 year sensitivity experiment with the Bergen Climate Model ( BCM ) for the present-day climate , but with enhanced runoff from the Arctic region throughout the integration . The AMOC drop by 30 % over the first 50 year , followed by a gradual recovery . The simulated response indicates that the present-day AMOC might be robust to the isolated effect of enhanced , high-latitude freshwater forcing on a centennial time scale , and that the western tropical North Atlantic may provide key information about the long-term variability , and by that monitoring , of the AMOC .

aVWe investigated the temperature dependence of some physiological parameter of common eelpout ( Zoarces viviparus ) from different location ( North Sea , Baltic Sea and Norwegian Sea ) on acclimation temperature ( 3 degreesC and 12 degreesC ) and acute temperature variation . The lethal limit of 12 degreesC-acclimated eelpout wa determined a the critical thermal maximum [ loss of equilibrium ( LE ) and onset of muscular spasm ( OS ) ] and it wa found to be 26.6 degreesC for LE and 28.8 degreesC for OS for all population . However , these parameter do not have any relevant ecological interpretation . We therefore investigated the effect of gradually increased water temperature on standard metabolic rate ( measured a resting oxygen consumption Mo-2 ) and critical oxygen concentration ( [ O-2 ] ( c ) ) of eelpout . Acclimation to low temperature ( 3 degreesC ) resulted in partial compensation of Mo-2 , paralleled by a decrease of activation energy for Mo-2 ( from 82 kJ mol ( -1 ) at 12 degreesC to about 50 kJ mol ( -1 ) at 3 degreesC ) in North Sea and Baltic Sea eelpout . At the same time , Norwegian eelpout showed no acclimation of oxygen demand to warm temperature ( 12 degreesC ) at all . The scope for eelpout aerobic metabolism shrank considerably with increased acclimation temperature , a [ O-2 ] ( c ) approached water oxygen concentration . At 22.5+/-1 degreesC the [ O-2 ] ( c ) reached air saturation , which is equivalent to the upper critical temperature ( Tc-II ) and at this temperature the aerobic scope for the metabolism completely disappeared . In line with previous insight , the comparative analysis of the temperature dependence of Mo-2 of Z. viviparus from different population suggests that a pejus ( sub-critical ) temperature for this specie is about 13-15 degreesC . In conclusion , the capacity to adjust aerobic metabolism relates to thermal tolerance and the bio-geographical distribution of the specie . Global warming would thus be likely to cause a shift in the distribution of this specie to the North .

aVThe effect of warming on a montane meadow wa simulated by a translocation experiment . A coherent piece of turf and soil wa transferred from 600 m to 170 m a.s.l. , corresponding to an increase in temperature of ca . 2.8 K. The vegetation wa monitored by recording cover and counting individual one year before the translocation and continued for the subsequent seven year . For comparison , a control plot that had also been translocated but remained at 600 m wa monitored . Four of eight specie with a montane distribution in Europe showed a constant degree of cover during the investigation period ( Nardus stricta , Poa chaixii , Polygonatum verticillatum , Potentilla erecta ) . In contrast , another four montane specie declined in cover or died out ( Arnica montana , Meum athamanticum , Hypericum maculatum , Galium harcynicum ) . None of these specie declined on the control plot . It is argued that the specie ' responded individualistically to the site factor that had changed with the translocation to low altitude . A direct effect of enhanced temperature wa probably the reason for the decline of only one specie ( Meum athamanticum ) . Reduced humidity might be the reason for the extinction of two moisture demanding specie ( Viola palustris , Succisa pratensis ) . The biomass of the plot increased by increased growth of one of the matrix specie ( Festuca rubra ) , probably due to elevated nutrient mineralization . Many low growing specie responded indirectly to the reduced light availability ; caused by an increased level of competition for light ( e.g . Galium harcynicum ) . Increased slug herbivory at low altitude resulted in the extinction of Arnica montana . At the end of the investigation period , the similarity in specie composition to the initial state wa only 45 % , indicating that the community had changed into a different plant association . The importance of considering biotic interaction when predicting the impact of climate change is discussed .

aVLimitations in available technique to separate autotrophic ( root ) and soil heterotrophic respiration have hampered the understanding of forest C cycling . The former is here defined a respiration by root , their associated mycorrhizal fungi and other micro-organism in the rhizosphere directly dependent on labile C compound leaked from root . In order to separate the autotrophic and heterotrophic component of soil respiration , all Scots pine tree in 900 m ( 2 ) plot were girdled to instantaneously terminate the supply of current photosynthates from the tree canopy to root . Hogberg et al . ( Nature 411 , 789-792 , 2001 ) reported that autotrophic activity contributed up to 56 % of total soil respiration during the first summer of this experiment . They also found that mobilization of stored starch ( and likely also sugar ) in root after girdling caused an increased apparent heterotrophic respiration on girdled plot . Herein a transient increase in the delta ( 13 ) C Of Soil CO ( 2 ) efflux after girdling , thought to be due to decomposition of ( 13 ) C-enriched ectomycorrhizal mycelium and root starch and sugar reserve , is reported . In the second year after girdling , when starch reserve of girdled tree root were exhausted , calculated root respiration increased up to 65 % of total soil CO ( 2 ) efflux . It is suggested that this estimate of it contribution to soil respiration is more precise than the previous based on one year of observation . Heterotrophic respiration declined in response to a 20-day-long 6 degreesC decline in soil temperature during the second summer , whereas root respiration did not decline . This did not support the idea that root respiration should be more sensitive to variation in soil temperature . It is suggested that above-ground photosynthetic activity and allocation pattern of recent photosynthates to root should be considered in model of response of forest C balance to global climate change .

aVContrary to the common perception that tropical cyclone are on the increase , due perhaps to global warming , study all over the world show that , although there are decadal variation , there is no definite long-term trend in the frequency or intensity of tropical cyclone over the period of about a century for which data are available . There is , nevertheless , a sharp increase in the socio-economic impact of tropical cyclone in the form of increasing property damage . An analysis of cyclone affecting the state of Andhra Pradesh , India , in the last quarter century by normalizing cyclone damage for economic and demographic factor show that here , a elsewhere , the greater vulnerability is attributable mainly to these factor and not to any increase in frequency or intensity of cyclone . The decrease of alertness in disaster management that often occurs after a few year ' lull in occurrence of cyclone , known a the `` fading memory syndrome , '' also contributes to increase in loss of life and property damage . This distinction between meteorological and socioeconomic cause for the increased impact is important to avoid a tendency for political and administrative decision maker to blame natural cause . They have to take these reality into account , not just in developing a vigilant disaster management system , but in land-use planning , development of coastal district , and insurance measure .

aVThe author of a recent commentary challenged a `` traditional view '' that organism living at high latitude are normally exposed to lower dos of potentially damaging UV-B radiation than those living at lower latitude . Taking a their main example the European common frog ( Rana temporaria L. ) in Scandinavia , they suggested that global warming might be masking adverse biological effect of ozone depletion , which allows a greater percentage of solar UV-B to reach the Earth 's surface , by altering specie ' phenology . Here , I expand the scope of that study to include phenology and potential exposure to UV-B radiation across a larger part of the common frog 's geographic range , including population from oceanic and alpine climate . The result highlight both the importance of phenology in limiting exposure to UV-B radiation and the need for a mechanistic understanding of phenological variation . The result also illustrate some important limitation of a commonly used field experiment , at least in term of it utility for comparing sensitivity to UV-B or predicting effect of ozone depletion .

aVHere we present the first systematic measurement of European mountain permafrost temperature from a latitudinal transect of six boreholes extending from the Alps , through Scandinavia to Svalbard . Boreholes were drilled in bedrock to depth of at least 100 m between May 1998 and September 2000 . Geothermal profile provide evidence for regional-scale secular warming , since all are nonlinear , with near-surface warm-side temperature deviation from the deeper thermal gradient . Topographic effect lead to variability between Alpine site . First approximation estimate , based on curvature within the borehole thermal profile , indicate a maximum ground surface warming of +1 degreesC in Svalbard , considered to relate to thermal change in the last 100 year . In addition , a 15-year time series of thermal data from the 58-m-deep Murtel-Corvatsch permafrost borehole in Switzerland , drilled in creeping frozen ice-rich rock debris , show an overall warming trend , but with high-amplitude interannual fluctuation that reflect early winter snow cover more strongly than air temperature . Thus interpretation of the deeper borehole thermal history must clearly take account of the potential effect of changing snow cover in addition to atmospheric temperature . ( C ) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

aVThe hydrologic cycle play an important role in carbon cycling , due to the coupling of vapor release and CO2 uptake during photosynthesis . This coupling , expressed a Water Use Efficiency ( WUE ) or Transpiration Ratio , can provide an inexpensive alternative for estimating the Net Primary Productivity ( NPP ) of terrestrial ecosystem . The D/H and O-18/O-16 trend of river water in the Mississippi basin are mostly indistinguishable from those of precipitation . This , combined with isotopic mass balance relationship , suggests that direct evaporation of surface water is small and evapotranspiration ( ET ) flux from the basin therefore consists mostly of interception and transpiration , with interception approximated from field study . The calculated water flux associated with transpiration is 1500.8 km ( 3 ) ( 77.3 % of the evapotranspiration flux ) . Utilizing the average WUE of 864 mol H2O for each mole of CO2 , the NPP of the Mississippi River basin amount to 1.16 Pg C/yr , similar to the model estimate of the heterotrophic soil respiration flux of 1.12 Pg C/yr . This doe not favor the postulated existence of a major sink for atmospheric CO2 in the temperate Northern Hemispheric ecosystem of the conterminous United States , but due to uncertainty in the input parameter we can not discount the possibility that these ecosystem act a a modest sink .

aVThis paper analysis the external transport cost estimate that have been found in various European study . These estimate seem at first glance to be highly dispersed , a fact which raise question about their reliability . The article offer a list of the possible reason for discrepancy between the various study ; difference in the specific situation studied , in the type of cost calculated , in the physical law relating to emission , in the measurement of value of external cost . It ass the relative magnitude of each of these cause through a meta-analysis . It turn out that the main difference come from the specificity of the situation under review and the type of cost calculated . In comparison , difference in the law and in the value method have a lower importance . The conclusion is that the estimate of external cost are reliable for decision-making policy .

aVDeep ocean storage of CO2 captured from , for example , flue gas is being considered a a potential response option to global warming concern . For storage to be effective , CO2 injected into the deep ocean must remain sequestered from the atmosphere for a long time . However , a fraction of CO2 injected into the deep ocean is expected to eventually evade into the atmosphere . This fraction is expected to depend on the time since injection , the location of injection , and the future atmospheric concentration of CO2 . We approximate the evasion of injected CO2 at specific location using a nonlinear convolution model including explicitly the nonlinear response of CO2 solubility to future CO2 concentration and alkalinity and Green 's function for the transport of CO2 from injection location to the ocean surface a well a alkalinity response to seafloor CaCO3 dissolution . Green 's function are calculated from the result of a three-dimensional model for ocean carbon cycle for impulse of CO2 either released to the atmosphere or injected a location deep in the Pacific and Atlantic ocean . CO2 transport in the three-dimensional ( 3-D ) model is governed by offline tracer transport in the ocean interior , exchange of CO2 with the atmosphere , and dissolution of ocean sediment . The convolution model is found to accurately approximate result of the 3-D model in test case including both deep-ocean injection and sediment dissolution . The convolution model allows comparison of the CO2 evasion delay achieved by deep ocean injection with notional scenario for CO2 stabilization and the time extent of the fossil fuel era .

aVThis paper examines a methodology for reducing the CO2 generated by vehicular traffic , a major source of global warming . Climatologists say the world can not wait 20 year for alternative fuel to start reversing the global warming trend-line , since by then considerable climate alteration and coastal damage will be manifest . The point is to dramatically reduce CO2 , a by-product of internal combustion engine operation , a quickly a feasible to overcome the half-century lead-time of CO2 buildup already in the atmosphere . Since CO2 production correlate directly with vehicle mass , this paper make the case for quickly reducing vehicle size . It also argues for re-introducing electric vehicle on a large scale , and altering the conventional highway configuration to achieve greater productivity . Fuel cell , even when fully accepted , will not improve important aspect of modern urban transport such a safety and traffic flow .

aVPan evaporation , an indicator of potential evaporation , ha decreased during the last several decade in many part of the world . This trend is contrary to the expectation that global warming will be accompanied by an increase in terrestrial evaporation , known a the pan evaporation paradox . In this paper we present an analysis of change in the spatial pattern of pan evaporation in China based on data from 85 weather station from 1955 to 2000 . We found that pan evaporation decreased in China from 1955 to 2000 . The decrease wa statistically significant in all of China 's eight climatic region except northeast China . We also found that the decrease in solar irradiance wa most likely the driving force for the reduced pan evaporation in China . However , unlike in other area of the world , in China the decrease in solar irradiance wa not always accompanied by an increase in cloud cover and precipitation . Therefore we speculate that aerosol may play a critical role in the decrease of solar irradiance in China . By subdividing China into eight climatic region , we found that the rate of decrease in pan evaporation wa highest in the northwest and lowest in the southwest . Although change in solar irradiance are the main cause of decreasing pan evaporation , water condition influence the sensitivity of pan evaporation to the change in solar irradiance in comparing the eight climatic region . Thus the spatial trend of pan evaporation differ from those of solar irradiance among these region .

aVThe first GCM climate change projection to include dynamic vegetation and an interactive carbon cycle produced a very significant amplification of global warming over the 21st century . Under the IS92a `` business a usual '' emission scenario CO2 concentration reached about 980 ppmv by 2100 , which is about 280 ppmv higher than when these feedback were ignored . The major contribution to the increased CO2 arose from reduction in soil carbon because global warming is assumed to accelerate respiration . However , there wa also a lesser contribution from an alarming loss of the Amazonian rainforest . This paper describes the phenomenon of Amazonian forest dieback under elevated CO2 in the Hadley Centre climate-carbon cycle model .

aVWhether a turtle embryo develops into a male or a female depends , a with many other reptile , on the temperature during incubation of the egg . With sea turtle , warm temperature produce 100 % female . Therefore , global warming ha the potential to drastically alter their sex ratio . Air temperature on Antigua have increased by 0.7degreesC over the last 35 year . Measurements in both the sand and the clutch laid by hawksbill turtle ( Eretmochelys imbricata ) at Pasture Bay , Antigua , show that for important part of the nesting season temperature are already above the level producing 50 % of each sex ( pivotal level ) . Comparisons are made to sand temperature measurement taken on this beach in 1989 and 1990 . It is estimated that fewer male were produced in 2003 than in the previous year . Recommendations are made for close monitoring of the fertility of egg and for research on any turtle nesting at cooler time of year .

aVThis paper considers the possible benefit of mitigation of climate change for coastal area with a strong emphasis on sea-level rise a this is one of the most certain consequence of human-induced global warming . There is a long-term 'commitment to sea-level rise ' due to the long thermal lag of the ocean system and hence the response of sea-level rise to mitigation is slower than for other climate factor . Therefore , while climate stabilisation reduces coastal impact during the 21st century , compared to unmitigated emission , the largest benefit may occur in the 22nd century ( and beyond ) . The result of the analysis suggest that a mixture of adaptation and mitigation policy need to be considered for coastal area , a this will provide a more robust response to human-induced climate change than either policy in isolation . This requires the joint evaluation of mitigation and adaptation in coastal area , ideally using a probabilistic risk-based methodology , which would be a departure from existing analysis . Because of the long time constant involved such assessment need to continue beyond 2100 to provide the full implication of the different policy choice . ( C ) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVSRI Consulting 's Process Economics Program ( PEP ) wa commissioned by it client to undertake a lifecycle assessment ( LCA ) for the purpose of comparing a biodegradable polymer with a conventional commodity polymer in packaging application . Biodegradable polymer offer the potential of addressing a wide range of environmental concern associated with conventional polymer such a greenhouse gas emission and sustainability . LCA is a tool specifically developed for assessing the overall environmental burden of a product including the system used for manufacturing it and it end-of-life treatment . This paper provides a cradle-to-grave LCA of two polymer that may be used in food packaging application : polylactide ( PLA ) , which is a biodegradable polymer derived from corn ; and polypropylene ( PP ) , which is primarily derived from natural gas in the United States . An inventory analysis of the PLA and PP system is presented . An impact assessment focused on global warming is also provided . Although measured field or facility data are preferred for a rigorous LCA , PEP data can provide a reasonable basis when measured data are unavailable . Energy inventory and greenhouse gas emission are readily derived from PEP data , but other potentially relevant impact indicator are not . ( C ) 2004 American Institute of Chemical Engineers .

The two most significant emission are carbon dioxide and methane . A significant fraction of emission is emitted by oil and gas production and transportation facility . Because methane ha at least 21 time the greenhouse gas potential of carbon dioxide , it is advantageous to convert methane to carbon dioxide via combustion , even if the carbon dioxide is vented to the atmosphere . Fugitive methane combustion doe however present certain difficulty in it combustion . This paper present an overview of the problem and suggests some possible catalytic reactor technology appropriate for the solution . ( C ) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVFive lagoonal salt marsh area , ranging from 220 ha to 3,670 ha , were selected from Cape Cod , Massachusetts to the southern DelMarVa peninsula , Virginia , USA to examine the degree to which Spartina marsh area and microhabitats had changed from the early or mid- 1900s to recent period . We chose area based on their importance to migratory bird population , agency concern about marsh loss and sea-level rise , and availability of historic imagery . We georeferenced and processed aerial photograph from a variety of source ranging from 1932 to 1994 . Of particular interest were change in total salt marsh area , tidal creek , tidal flat , tidal and non-tidal pond , and open water habitat . Nauset Marsh , within Cape Cod National Seashore , experienced an annual marsh loss of 0.40 % ( 19 % from 1947 to 1994 ) with most loss attributed to sand overwash and conversion to open water . At Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge in southern New Jersey , annual loss wa 0.27 % ( 17 % from 1932 to 1995 ) , with nearly equal attribution of loss to open water and tidal pond expansion . At Curlew Bay , Virginia , annual loss wa 0.20 % ( 9 % from 1949 to 1994 ) and almost entirely due to perimeter erosion to open water . At Gull Marsh , Virginia , a site chosen because of known erosional loss , we recorded the highest annual loss rate , 0.67 % per annum , again almost entirely due to erosional , perimeter loss . In contrast , at the southernmost site , Mockhorn Island Wildlife Management Area , Virginia , there wa a net gain of 0.09 % per annum ( 4 % from 1949 to 1994 ) , with tidal flat becoming increasingly vegetated . Habitat . implication for waterbird are considerable ; salt marsh specialist such a laughing gull ( Larus atricilla ) , Forster 's tern ( Sterna forsteri ) , black rail , ( Laterallus jamaicensis ) , seaside sparrow ( Ammodramus maritimus ) , and saltmarsh sharp-tailed sparrow ( Ammodramus caudacutus ) are particularly at risk if these trend continue , and all but the laughing gull are specie of concern to state and federal manager .

aVA paradigm in biogeography is that organism have 'abundant center ' distribution , with abundance peaking at the range center and declining towards the range boundary . One explanation for this pattern is that abundance are associated with organism ' physiological stress level and performance , with organism experiencing more stress at the range edge . Here we explored whether the intertidal dogwhelk Nucella canaliculata wa distributed in an 'abundant center ' pattern . We addressed the role of stress in setting the specie ' range limit . We determined dogwhelk abundance at range-center and range-edge site and measured physiological stress level by quantifying the 70 kDa heat-shock protein a a biochemical stress index . N. canaliculata wa le abundant and more stressed at it southern range edge than at the range center , suggesting that population at the range edge may be most impacted by global climate change .

aVThere are accumulating report showing that the El Nino/Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) ha a significant effect on the population dynamic of marine fish . However , the influence of ENSO on the physiology of fish , a possible component of those ecological change in fish population , is not fully understood . This study investigated the cellular , physiological , and organismal stress response in a wild fish population under natural thermal stress . The sea surface temperature at the subtropical ocean of Okinawa , Japan , wa the highest in the last 10 year ( > 32degreesC ) during the summer of 1998 with a strong ENSO . To examine the effect of those unusually warm ocean temperature on fish , we compared tissue 70-kDa heat shock protein ( HSP70 ) level and growth rate between the ENSO summer of 1998 and the normal summer of 1999 in a common fish specie in Okinawa , the Indo-Pacific sergeant , Abudefduf vaigiensis . We also conducted a complementary heat shock experiment in the laboratory . The field collected Indo-Pacific sergeant had significantly higher muscle HSP70 level in 1998 than 1999 . Higher muscle HSP70 and plasma cortisol level were observed at 32degreesC than at 28degreesC in the laboratory heat shock experiment , indicating that the highest summer ocean temperature in 1998 wa sufficient for the fish to up-regulate the cellular and physiological stress response . In support of this effect , otoliths showed slower growth rate of the fish during the summer of 1998 ; this may reflect the significant energetic cost of these stress response .

aVThe Arctic is one region where the effect of global climate change are expected to be easy to observe . This study identifies region in the circumpolar Arctic that have experienced similar change in the seasonal cycle of temperature and precipitation over recent decade . Data from Arctic and northern nation have been compiled to form a new data set of over 1200 circumpolar Arctic climate station . Changes in the seasonal cycle between two decade ( 1976-85 and 1986-95 ) are examined for the 247 temperature and 555 precipitation station that meet specific completeness criterion . Inter-decadal shift are analyzed using 11-day average of daily mean temperature and 5-day average of total daily precipitation . Examined at time-steps finer than annual or monthly mean , climatic variation in the region are not consistent either through the season or across space . Some area have demonstrated recent increase in temperature or precipitation , while others have displayed decrease in these element . Many area reveal climatic shift in specific period of the year that contrast markedly with the trend observed in other period and other place .

Over the course of the integration , there is a general decrease in the number of cyclone event in both the northern and the southern hemisphere . Although the total number of cyclone event decrease , the number of intense event in both hemisphere increase . The relation between the low-level temperature field and the total number of event a well a the relation between precipitation and intense event are discussed .

aVAs the evidence of global climate change continues to mount , it consequence for cropland productivity assume particular significance . Against the backdrop of past agricultural practice , simulation model offer a glimpse into the future , showing the effect of temperature change on crop production . In this study , we first quantified the carbon ( C ) and nitrogen ( N ) budget of Ohio 's cropland ecosystem using inventory yield data of corn for grain , oat , and all wheat for the period 1866-1996 and soybean for the period 1924-96 . Then we explored the response of Ohio 's continuous soybean croplands to change in temperature , carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) concentration , initial soil organic C and N ( SOC-N ) pool , soil texture , and management practice by developing a simple cropland ecosystem model ( CEM ) and performing a long-term sensitivity analysis . Finally , CEM simulation were evaluated against independent observation of SOC value ( 0-19 cm ) averaged over 470 northwest Ohio site between 1954 and 1987 under conventional tillage and rotation of corn-soybean-winter wheat by using the historical yield data ( r ( 2 ) = 0.8 ) . The C content per hectare of crop harvest increased by 178 % for oat , 300 % for corn for grain , and 652 % for all wheat between 1866 and 1996 and by 305 % for soybean between 1924 and 1996 . Ohio croplands acted a C-N source , releasing average net ecosystem emission ( NEE ) , including the removal of harvested C-N , of 4,598 kg CO2 ha ( -1 ) and 141 kg N ha ( -1 ) in 1886 and 205 kg CO2 ha ( -1 ) ( except for the corn-for-grain cropland ) and 39 kg N ha ( -1 ) in 1996 . The continuous corn croplands continued to become a C sink , sequestering 255 kg C ha ( -1 ) in 1996 . Results of the sensitivity analysis for Ohio 's continuous soybean croplands revealed that the SOC pool increased by 6.9 % and decreased by 7.5 % in response to a doubled CO2 concentration and a temperature increase of 2.8degreesC over 100 year , respectively . The sequestration potential of the SOC pool increased by 6.5 % at a rate of 24.6 kg C ha ( -1 ) y ( -1 ) for the same period with finer soil texture ( loam to silty clay loam ) . The shift from conventional to conservation residue practice led to an 11 % increase in the steady-state SOC storage at a rate of 42 kg C ha ( -1 ) y ( -1 ) for 100 year .

aVIn the ocean , large-scale dispersal and replenishment by larva is a key process underlying biological change associated with global warming . On tropical reef , coral bleaching , degradation of habitat and declining adult stock are also likely to change contemporary pattern of dispersal and gene flow and may lead to range contraction or expansion . On the Great Barrier Reef , where adjacent reef form a highly interconnected system , we use allozyme survey of c. 3000 coral colony to show that population are genetically diverse , and rate of gene flow for a suite of five specie range from modest to high among reef up to 1200 km apart . In contrast , 700 km further south on Lord Howe Island , genetic diversity is markedly lower and population are genetically isolated . The virtual absence of long-distance dispersal of coral to geographically isolated , oceanic reef render them extremely vulnerable to global warming , even where local threat are minimal .

aVDebate over whether human activity cause Earth climate change obscures the immensity of the dynamic system that create and maintain climate on the planet . Anthropocentric debate lead people to believe that they can alter these planetary dynamic system to prevent what they perceive a negative climate impact on human civilization . Although politician offer simplistic remedy , such a the Kyoto Protocol , global climate continues to change naturally . Better planning for the inevitable dislocation that have followed natural global climate change throughout human history requires u to accept the fact that climate will change , and that human society must adapt to the change . Over the last decade , the scientific literature reported a shift in emphasis from attempting to build theoretical model of putative human impact on climate to understanding the planetwide dynamic process that are the natural climate driver . The current scientific literature is-beginning to report the history of past climate change , the extent of natural climate variability , natural system driver , and the episodicity of many climate change . The scientific argument have broadened from focus upon human effect on climate to include the array of natural phenomenon that have driven global climate change for eon . However , significant political issue with long-term social consequence continue their advance . This paper summarizes recent scientific progress in climate science and argument about human influence on climate .

aVRecent study using both field measurement and satellite-derived-vegetation index have demonstrated that global warming is influencing vegetation growth and phenology . To accurately predict the future response of vegetation to climate variation , a thorough understanding of vegetation phenological cycle and their relationship to temperature and precipitation is required . In this paper , vegetation phenological transition date identified using data from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) in 2001 are linked with MODIS land surface temperature ( LST ) data from the northern hemisphere between 35degreesN and 70degreesN . The result show well-defined pattern dependent on latitude , in which vegetation greenup gradually migrates northward starting in March , and dormancy spread southward from late September . Among natural vegetation land-cover type , the growing-season length for forest is strongly correlated with variation in mean annual LST . For urban area , the onset of greenup is 4-9 day earlier on average , and the onset of dormancy is about 2-16 day later , relative to adjacent natural vegetation . This difference ( especially for urban vs. forest ) is apparently related to urban heat island effect that result in both the average spring temperature and the mean annual temperature in urban area being about 1-3degreesC higher relative to rural area . The result also indicate that urban heat island effect on vegetation phenology are stronger in North America than in Europe and Asia . Finally , the onset of forest greenup at continental scale can be effectively described using a thermal time-chilling model , which can be used to infer the delay or advance of greenup onset in relation to climatic warming at global scale .

aVEcological community structure is particularly important in vector-borne zoonotic disease with complex life cycle . Qualitative community model analysis may provide a meaningful alternative to standard population-based model of vector-borne disease . We built on recent mathematical development in qualitative community modeling coupled with conventional biomathematical model of vector-borne disease transmission , to provide a procedure to analyze risk . Using this procedure , we can hypothesize change in risk of vector-borne disease from disturbance , such a control measure , habitat alteration , or global warming . We demonstrate the application of this procedure to an oak forest community to predict the risk of Lyme disease . Our prediction of Lyme disease risk in an oak forest community confirm report of positive association between deer abundance and risk of disease and are consistent with published observation .

aVThe objective of this work is to evaluate the contribution of the several household water heating system to global warming using the life cycle analysis . The system studied were the electric showerhead , the passage gas heater and the solar heater . The water heating system can pollute the environment through the emission of greenhouse gas which occurs during the generation of electric power for manufacturing the component of these system and the use of the electric showerhead and resistance of the boiler of the solar system , and during the combustion of fossil fuel gas heater and transport of the heating system 's component . The result show that , for the adopted parameter , the electric showerhead consumes the most electric power and emits the most pollutant during it life cycle . ( C ) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

aVVertical temperature profile were recorded from June 1999 to October 2002 ( at least once a month ) at two Mediterranean site , in the eastern basin ( Batroun , Lebanon ; 0-100 m ) and in the northwestern basin ( Marseilles , France ; 0-55 m ) . At the two site , the thermal seasonal evolution and the thermocline time dynamic are quite identical . But in the Lebanese water , at comparable water depth , temperature are currently 4 to 5 degreesC higher than in the French water , the thermocline is longer ( more than 6 month ) , permanent and deeper ( 40-50 m ) than in Marseilles ( 20-30 m ) . The latter frequently disappears in summer due to northwest wind inducing cold water . This is principally due to difference in prevailing wind regime at each site . Such evaluation , coupled with long-term observation of temporal evolution of coastal water at the regional level of the Mediterranean basin , will shed light on temperature regime fluctuation and their consequence in the context of global warming of the Mediterranean .

aVThe selection of an appropriate `` optimal '' recycling alternative ha to take into consideration both the ecological and economic effect of the entire life-cycle . The aim of this paper is to compare different waste management system by mean of a life-cycle assessment ( LCA ) and a cost comparison . The analysis us data regarding the amount of household waste generated , collected and treated in a selected area in Austria . For this purpose , model-based scenario with recycling and separate collection a well a scenario without recycling were created . The database cover the amount of household waste generated in the different collection scheme , the transport distance by private delivery and by regional waste management company and data on the waste treatment process that are widely employed throughout Austria and Germany . The resulting life-cycle inventory have been assessed according to three impact category relevant to this topic-the global warming potential ( GWP ) , the acidification potential ( AP ) and the net energy use ( NEU ) . The result include ecological impact analysis and cost comparison for the overall waste management system and the waste management system for the individual waste types-waste paper , plastic packaging , metal packaging and waste glass . Finally , a sensitivity analysis should prove the validity of the result for region with transport distance differing from those in the area under analysis .

aVA precise assessment of the hydrological change in the northern Atlantic Ocean throughout the last climatic cycle stand a one of the key priority for understanding the mechanism of global climate change . A high resolution micropalaeontological study of a sediment core ( MD95-2015 ) retrieved from the South Icelandic Basin , allows u to infer pattern of North Atlantic surface hydrological change during the present ( Holocene ) and the ultimate ( Marine Isotopic Stage 5 ) Interglacial period . The downcore distribution of organic-walled dinoflagellate cyst ( dinocysts ) is used , in conjunction with additional proxy ( sediment magnetic susceptibility , CaCO ( 3 ) , stable isotope and planktic foraminifer assemblage ) to identify climatic instability of various amplitude . These event are mostly characterised by prominent change in relative abundance of the dinocysts Spiniferites mirabilis and Operculodinium centrocarpum , whose maximum value are thought to trace sea-surface temperature peak at the core site . Two hypsithermal period are identified on this basis , between 126 and 120 kyr BP and from 9.2 to 5.7 cal kyr BP ( similar to8-5 ( 14 ) C kyr BP ) , respectively . Some discrepancy between the micropalaeontological tracer used are discussed here in the light of their qualitative and quantitative ( transfer function ) ecological interpretation .

aVSeveral environmental indicator show that climate changed dramatically at the turn of the 19th century , with global warming throughout the 20th century . Among the most used proxy to evaluate long-term change in climate are tree located at their northern range limit . Several study have shown enhanced tree regeneration at treeline caused by recent warming , but no data are available on height growth performance of forest tree at treeline before and during the 20th century warmth . In this study , we examined the long-term growth performance of black spruce ( Picea mariana [ Mill . ] B.S.P . ) tree located in a lichen-spruce woodland , near the arctic treeline in eastern Canada . The study woodland is an old-growth stand that ha escaped fire approximately during the past two millennium . We performed stem analysis on normally developed tree which grew in the woodland over the last century . The sampled tree are ramets from long-lived , self-regenerating black spruce clone that are forming small tree island within the woodland . The co-occurrence of living and dead tree stem inside clone give the opportunity to evaluate the growth performance of the same genet through time . Height and radial growth of 60 tree stem from 15 old-growth clone were evaluated for a period spanning the last 400 yr. Sampling included the two tallest living stem and the two tallest dead stem of randomly selected clone . No difference in height and radial growth were found among the 30 living stem nor among the 30 dead stem within clone . Living stem were 2 m taller and radial growth wa 1.6 time greater than dead stem . Vertical development of stem wa divided into two part according to position of snow cover . Growth of dead and living stem wa similar below the snowpack line . However , significant difference were found for growth above snowpack for the two type of stem . Growth above snow cover for all dead stem occurred between the 17th and 19th century . In contrast , growth of living stem above snow cover started during the late 19th century . Our data indicate that stem of the same genotype responded directly to climate change , in conjunction with climatic condition prevailing at the time when they were protruding above the snowpack . Compared to extant tree , significantly smaller tree grew in the woodland during the Little Ice Age . Potential causal factor of differential growth performance through time are discussed .

aVThe response of marine and terrestrial environment to global change in atmospheric carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) concentration will likely be governed by both response to direct environmental forcing and response to Earth-system feedback induced by that forcing . it ha been proposed that anthropogenic greenhouse forcing will intensify coastal upwelling in eastern boundary current region [ Bakun , A . ( 1990 ) Science 247 , 198-201 ] . Focusing on the California Current , we show that biophysical land-cover-atmosphere feedback induced by CO2 radiative forcing enhance the radiative effect Of CO2 on land-sea thermal contrast , resulting in change in eastern boundary current total seasonal upwelling and upwelling seasonality . Specifically , relative to CO2 radiative forcing , land-cover-atmosphere feedback lead to a stronger increase in peak- and late-season near-shore upwelling in the northern limb of the California Current and a stronger decrease in peak- and late-season near-shore upwelling in the southern limb . Such change will impact both marine and terrestrial community [ Bakun , A . ( 1990 ) Science 247,198-201 ; Soto , C. G. ( 2001 ) Rev . Fish Biol . Fish . 11 , 181-195 ; and Agostini , V. N. & Bakun , A . ( 2002 ) Fish . Oceanogr . 11 , 129-142 ] , and these and other Earth-system feedback should be expected to play a substantial role in shaping the response of eastern boundary current region to CO2 radiative forcing .

aVPalaeoceanographic data have been used to suggest that methane hydrate play a significant role in global climate change . The mechanism by which methane is released during period of global warming is , however , poorly understood ( 1 ) . In particular , the size and role of the free-gas zone below gas-hydrate province remain relatively unconstrained , largely because the base of the free-gas zone is not a phase boundary and ha thus defied systematic description . Here we evaluate the possibility that the maximum thickness of an interconnected free-gas zone is mechanically regulated by valving caused by fault slip in overlying sediment ( 2 ) . Our result suggest that a critical gas column exists below most hydrate province in basin setting , implying that these province are poised for mechanical failure and are therefore highly sensitive to change in ambient condition ( 3 ) . We estimate that the global free-gas reservoir may contain from one-sixth to two-thirds of the total methane trapped in hydrate ( 4 ) . If gas accumulation are critically thick along passive continental slope , we calculate that a 5 degreesC temperature increase at the sea floor could result in a release of similar to2,000 Gt of methane from the free-gas zone , offering a mechanism for rapid methane release during global warming event .

aVIn the context of global warming , it is a well-known fact that there is an increase in precipitation in middle latitude . Convective phenomenon have also been on the increase in the past few decade . It is gradually becoming more difficult to characterize climatic trend in middle latitude . Data show that there may be different result depending on the study zone . Thus , it is interesting to study climatic change in recent precipitation series , especially if we can have at our disposal a dense network of rainfall station with reliable precipitation series . The analysis of precipitation series in 333 rainfall station from 1961 to 1990 ha revealed that summer precipitation show a statistically significant trend in wide area of Mainland Spain . In the month of July and August , the precipitation is exclusively convective . In those month , the precipitation increased in 20 % of the southern area , that is , in those area where temperature are on average higher . June and September present different trend showing a decrease in precipitation in 10 % of the territory . ( C ) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V .

aVBackground : Foodborne illness is a significant public health issue in most country , including Australia . We examined the association between temperature and salmonellosis notification , and compared these association for 5 Australian city . Methods : Log-linear model describing monthly salmonellosis notification in term of calendar time and monthly average temperature were fitted over the period 1991 to 2001 for each city . We used a negative binomial chance model to accommodate overdispersion in the count . Results : The long-term trend showed an increase in salmonellosis notification in each of the 5 city . There wa a positive association between monthly salmonellosis notification and mean monthly temperature of the previous month in every city . Seasonal pattern in salmonellosis notification were fully explained by change in temperature . Discussion : The strength of the association , the consistency across 5 city , and a plausible biologic pathway suggest that higher ambient temperature are a cause of higher salmonellosis notification . The lag of 1 month suggests that temperature might be more influential earlier in the production process rather than at the food preparation stage . This knowledge can help to guide policy on food preparation and distribution . It also suggests a basis for an early warning system for increased risk from salmonellosis , and raise yet another possible health problem with global warming .

aVThe rock glacier Innere Olgrube , located in a small side valley of the Kauner Valley ( Otztal Alps , Austria ) , consists of two separate , tongue-shaped rock glacier lying next to each other . Investigations indicate that both rock glacier contain a core of massive ice . During winter , the temperature at the base of the snow cover ( BTS ) is significantly lower at the active rock glacier than on permafrost-free ground adjacent to the rock glacier . Discharge is characterized by strong seasonal and diurnal variation , and is strongly controlled by the local weather condition . Water temperature of the rock glacier spring remains constantly low , mostly below 1degreesC during the whole melt season . The morphology of the rock glacier and the presence of meltwater lake in their rooting zone a well a the high surface flow velocity of > 1 m/yr point to a glacial origin . The northern rock glacier , which is bounded by lateral moraine , evolved from the debris-covered tongue of a small glacier of the Little Ice Age with it last highstand around A.D. 1850 . Due to the global warming in the following decade , the upper part of the steep and debris-free ice glacier melted , whereas the debris-covered glacier tongue transformed into an active rock glacier . Due to this evolution and due to the downslope movement , the northern rock glacier , although still active , at present is cut off from it ice and debris supply . The southern rock glacier ha developed approximately during the same period from a debris-covered cirque glacier at the foot of the Wannetspitze massif . ( C ) 2004 University of Washington .

aVGlobal concern over increasing carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) concentration in the atmosphere leading to possible future climate change have generated interest in offsetting CO2 emission by storing carbon in forest . Carbon-sequestering forest activity may be one of the least expensive approach to mitigate the build up of atmospheric CO2 . However , the fact that forest management practice are species- , site-and management-objective-specific increase the complexity of using the forestry sector to mitigate global warming . In order to provide useful and timely information concerning carbon sequestration , this study investigated three forestry-based opportunity for sequestering carbon in the United States : conversion of marginal agricultural land to forest and reforestation of poorly stocked pine plantation in the South , afforestation of the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley ( LMAV ) , and reclamation and afforestation of abandoned mined land ( AML ) . This study conducted economic analysis on three region -species combination : loblolly pine ( Pinus taeda L. ) in the southern state , cherrybark oak ( Quercus pagoda Raf . ) in the LMAV , and northern red oak ( Quercus rubra L. ) on AML in West Virginia . The objective of this study were to determine the profitability of managing these three commercial tree specie for timber production only and for the combination of timber production and carbon sequestration and then calculate net tonne of carbon stored during one rotation and net revenue generated from each tonne of carbon sequestered .

aVThe promotion of scrap recycling in steel making is effective to reduce the discharge of CO2 and prevent the global warming . But , the scrap recycling ha been limited to the production of low grade steel product such a shape and bar , because of the detrimental effect of tramp element such a Cu and Sn on the productivity and the quality of steel product . In this study , the effect of Cu and Sn on the zinc phosphatability in dip type phosphating of cold-rolled steel sheet annealed in N-2-H-2 and vacuum atmosphere are investigated to obtain the technical information which is necessary to extend the scrap recycling to sheet product . The following result are obtained . 1 ) The zinc phosphatability of cold-rolled steel sheet annealed in N-2-H-2 atmosphere deteriorates slightly with increasing Cu content , however , it deteriorates remarkably with increasing Sn content . 2 ) The zinc phosphatability of cold-rolled steel sheet annealed in vacuum atmosphere deteriorates remarkably with increasing both Cu and So content . 3 ) The deterioration of zinc phosphatability of cold-rolled steel sheet annealed in both atmosphere with increasing So content is considered to be caused the decrease in surface reactionability with the segregation of So on surface .

aVThe impact of global warming on aquatic ecosystem are expected to be most pronounced at higher trophic level in cold-water environment . Therefore , we hypothesized that warming of fishless alpine pond would suppress large-bodied consumer ( e.g. , cladocerans , copepod ) and stimulate fast-growing microorganism ( e.g. , phytoflagellates , rotifer ) , thereby altering the community composition and total abundance of zooplankton and phytoplankton . This hypothesis wa tested using three block of four experimental mesocosms ( 1000-liter capacity ) that were located next to alpine pond in Banff National Park , Canada . Each block received unfiltered pond water and sediment from a pond following ice out in June 2000 . A warming treatment ( control vs. 3.6degreesC warmed ) wa achieved by controlling the ventilation of greenhouse canopy that were suspended over each of the mesocosms . By the end of our 50-d experiment , warming significantly suppressed total zooplankton biomass because large cladocerans ( Daphnia pulex ) declined while rotifer ( Keratella cochlearis , Conochilus unicornis ) abundance increased during the second half of the experiment . In contrast , warming did not affect total phytoplankton biomass but significantly altered community composition by favoring phytoflagellates ( Mallomonas , Synura , Trachelomonas ) over larger filamentous green algae ( Mougeotia , Phymatodocis ) . Warming did not significantly increase dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus concentration . Therefore , warmer growing condition and reduced grazer biomass best explained the increased abundance of more edible , fast-growing phytoflagellates in the warmed mesocosms . Our finding support the hypothesis that moderate warming can destabilize plankton dynamic , thereby potentially reducing the reliability of water quality and food resource for higher trophic level ( e.g. , planktivorous fish ) in shallow cold-water ecosystem .

aV[ 1 ] Management of agricultural soil play an important role in present and future atmospheric concentration of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide ( CO ( 2 ) ) , nitrous oxide ( N ( 2 ) O ) , and methane ( CH ( 4 ) ) . Pesticides are used a management tool in crop production , but little is known about their effect on soil-atmosphere exchange of CO ( 2 ) , N ( 2 ) O , and CH ( 4 ) . Field study described in this paper determined the effect of two commonly used fungicide , mancozeb and chlorothalonil , on trace gas exchange . Separate experimental plot , 1 m 2 , were established in nitrogen fertilized no-tilled native grassland and tilled soil with and without fungicide application . Two study were conducted . The first study wa initiated in June 1999 and lasted for 1 year with monthly flux measurement from tilled and no-till soil . The second study commenced in August 2001 with twelve weekly measurement from tilled soil only . From both study mancozeb suppressed emission of CO ( 2 ) and N ( 2 ) O in the tilled soil by an average of 28 % and 47 % , respectively . This suppression corresponded with efficacy period of 14-29 and 56-77 day , respectively . From the no-till soil mancozeb decreased CO ( 2 ) and N ( 2 ) O emission by 33 % and 80 % for period of 29 and 94 day , respectively . Mancozeb inhibited CH4 consumption in the first study by 46 % and 71 % in the tilled and no-till soil for period of 8 and 29 day , respectively , but had no effect in the second study . From both study chlorothalonil initially suppressed CO ( 2 ) and N ( 2 ) O emission and enhanced CH ( 4 ) uptake in the tilled soil by an average of 37 % , 40 % , and 115 % , respectively . These effect corresponded with efficacy period of 14-29 , 21 - 56 , and 1 - 14 day , respectively . In the no-till soil chlorothalonil inhibited CO ( 2 ) and N ( 2 ) O emission and enhanced CH ( 4 ) uptake by 29 % , 48 % , and 86 % for period of 29 , 56 , and 56 day , respectively . Following the initial period of suppression , chlorothalonil subsequently enhanced N ( 2 ) O emission in the tilled soil by an average of 51 % and in the no-till soil by 81 % before returning to near background level . The beginning of increased N ( 2 ) O emission from the chlorothalonil-amended plot corresponded with a maximum soil concentration of the chlorothalonil degradate , 4-hydroxy-2 , 5 , 6-trichloroisophthalonitrile . The site specific global warming potential ( GWP ) resulting from the flux of CO ( 2 ) , N ( 2 ) O , and CH ( 4 ) from all soil wa determined to decrease by an average 26 % and 21 % a a result of a single application of mancozeb or chlorothalonil , respectively . The decrease in CO ( 2 ) emission in the fungicide-amended plot potentially could result in the conservation of a much a 1200 and 2400 kg C ha ( -1 ) yr ( -1 ) organic carbon in the tilled and no-till plot , respectively . Therefore it is feasible that application of certain fungicide to agricultural soil might lead to enhanced soil carbon sequestration and thus have additional positive effect on atmospheric CO ( 2 ) concentration .

aV[ 1 ] The effect that pesticide have on trace gas production and consumption in agricultural soil is often overlooked . Independent field and laboratory experiment were used to measure the effect that the commonly used herbicide prosulfuron and metolachlor have on trace gas flux ( CO ( 2 ) , N ( 2 ) O , and CH ( 4 ) ) from fertilized soil of the Colorado shortgrass steppe . Separate sample plot ( 1 m ( 2 ) ) on tilled and no-till soil at the site included the following treatment : 1 ) a control without fertilizer or herbicide , 2 ) a fertilized ( NH ( 4 ) NO ( 3 ) equivalent to 244 kg ha ( -1 ) ) control without herbicide , 3 ) and fertilized plot amended with an herbicide ( prosulfuron equivalent to 0.46 kg ha ( -1 ) 57 % by weight active ingredient or metolachlor equivalent to 5.7 L ha ( -1 ) , 82.4 % by weight active ingredient ) . During an initial study of one year duration , measurement of gas exchange revealed that prosulfuron-amendment stimulated N ( 2 ) O emission and CH ( 4 ) consumption by a much a 1600 % and 1300 % during a single measurement , respectively . During a second set of flux measurement beginning in August 2001 , more frequent weekly measurement were made during a twelve week period . From this second study an increased N ( 2 ) O efflux and CH ( 4 ) uptake occurred after a 7-week lag period that persisted for about 5 week . These change in gas flux amounted to an overall increase of 41 % and 30 % for N ( 2 ) O emission and CH ( 4 ) consumption , respectively . The co-occurrence of stimulated N ( 2O ) and CH ( 4 ) flux suggests a similar cause that is related to prosulfuron degradation . Evidence suggested that prosulfuron degradation stimulated microbial activity responsible for trace gas flux . Ultimately , prosulfuron-amendment led to an -50 % reduction in the global warming potential from N ( 2 ) O and CH ( 4 ) flux at this field site , which is equivalent to a reduction of the global warming potential of 0.18 mol CO ( 2 ) m ( -2 ) d ( -1 ) from these gas . Metolachlor application did not significantly affect the trace gas flux measured . These result demonstrate the potential impact that pesticide have on trace gas flux from agricultural soil , which could mean that the effect of other agricultural practice have been over or under estimated .

aVWe studied the three-way interaction of elevated CO2 , nitrogen ( N ) , and temperature ( T ) , and the two-way interaction of elevated CO2 and early-season defoliation on the secondary chemistry and resistance of Eurasian silver birch ( Betula pendula ) and North American paper birch ( B. papyrifera ) against the Eurasian hare ( Lepus timidus ) and the North American eastern cottontail rabbit ( Sylvilagus floridanus ) , respectively . Elevated CO2 decreased the palatability of winter-dormant silver and paper birch stem to both hare and rabbit , respectively . But the effect on hare wa only apparent at intermediate level of N fertilization . Elevated T had no effect on palatability . The effect of elevated CO2 , N , and T on level of silver birch bark phenolic and terpenoids were dominated by two-way interaction between N and CO2 , and N and T. Generally , however , N amendment elicited a parabolic response in carbon partitioning to most biosynthetic class of silver birch phenolic ( i.e . highest concentration occurring at intermediate N ) . CO2 elevation wa most enhancing at highest level of N. On the other hand , T increase , more often than not , elicited reduction in phenolic , but especially so at the highest N level . In the case of B. papyrifera , elevated CO2 increased carbon partitioning to Folin-Denis stem and branch phenolic and condensed tannin . Early-season defoliation , on the other hand , had no effect on phenolic and tannin but lowered both N and energy level of branch . Elevated CO2 substantially ameliorated the negative effect of severe defoliation on tree growth . These result support the hypothesis that continuing anthropogenic alteration of the atmosphere may trigger significant change in plant phenotypic resistance to mammalian herbivore owing to an increasing net carbon balance between the highly vagile supply and demand capacity of plant carbon source and sink .

aVCalifornia 's primary hydrologic system , the San Francisco Estuary and it upstream watershed , is vulnerable to the regional hydrologic consequence of projected global climate change . Previous work ha shown that a projected warming would result in a reduction of snowpack storage leading to higher winter and lower spring-summer streamflows and increased spring-summer salinity in the estuary . The present work show that these hydrologic change exhibit a strong dependence on elevation , with the greatest loss of snowpack volume in the 1300 - 2700 m elevation range . Exploiting hydrologic and estuarine modeling capability to trace water a it move through the system reveals that the shift of water in mid-elevations of the Sacramento river basin from snowmelt to rainfall runoff is the dominant cause of projected change in estuarine inflow and salinity . Additionally , although spring-summer loss of estuarine inflow are balanced by winter gain , the loss have a stronger influence on salinity since longer spring-summer residence time allow the inflow change to accumulate in the estuary . The change in inflow sourced in the Sacramento River basin in approximately the 1300 - 2200 m elevation range thereby lead to a net increase in estuarine salinity under the projected warming . Such change would impact ecosystem throughout the watershed and threaten to contaminate much of California 's freshwater supply .

aVThe process energy consumption wa estimated for gas separation process by the formation of clathrate hydrate . The separation process is based on the equilibrium partition of the component between the gaseous phase and the hydrate phase . The separation and capturing process of greenhouse gas were examined in this study . The target component were hydrofluorocarbon ( HFC-134a ) from air , sulfur hexafluoride ( SF6 ) from nitrogen , and CO2 from flue gas . Since these greenhouse gas would form hydrate under much lower pressure and higher temperature condition than the accompanying component , the effective capturing of the greenhouse gas could be achieved by using hydrate formation . A model separation process for each gaseous mixture wa designed from the basis of thermodynamics , and the process energy consumption wa estimated . The obtained result were then compared with those for conventional separation process such a liquefaction separation process . For the recovery of SF6 , the hydrate process is preferable to liquefaction process in term of energy consumption . On the other hand , the liquefaction process consumes le energy than the hydrate process for the recovery of HFC-134a . The capturing Of CO2 by the hydrate process from a flue gas will consume a considerable amount of energy ; mainly due to the extremely high pressure condition required for hydrate formation . The influence of the operation condition on the beat of hydrate formation were elucidated by sensitivity analysis . The hydrate process for separating these greenhouse gas were evaluated in term of reduction of global warming potential ( GWP ) . ( C ) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVThe effect of global warming can increase the risk of exotic specie introduction in eastern Canadian Arctic water by reducing surface ice cover and allow increased access to commercial vessel . Ballast water discharged by incoming overseas vessel is an important mean for introducing specie on a global scale . Analyses of air temperature at Churchill , Manitoba between 1943 and 2002 indicated an increase in mean temperature within the past decade . Churchill is the only major northern port in this region where grain ha been exported on a limited basis due to the short navigation season . Economic analysis of grain exported from Canadian and U.S. port indicated some cost advantage for using northern port . The Hudson Bay region is vulnerable to increased exotic specie introduction because of it southerly location . Current ballast water exchange measure to reduce the risk of introduction may not be effective because most vessel enter the region with ballast , and the ballast exchange zone is located relatively close to coastal area where the habitat could be favorable for an introduced specie to become established . The probability of a large crab specie introduced to this region from northern European water is discussed . The risk of ballast water-related exotic specie introduction to this region may be reduced by expanding the type of cargo handled and developing a strong import market . This approach would accommodate an increase in the number of vessel with cargo , and substantially reduce the volume of ballast carried to this region .

aVThere is ongoing debate concerning the possible environmental and human health impact of growing genetically modified ( GM ) crop . Here , we report the result of a life-cycle assessment ( LCA ) comparing the environmental and human health impact of conventional sugar beet growing regime in the UK and Germany with those that might be expected if GM herbicide-tolerant ( to glyphosate ) sugar beet is commercialized . The result presented for a number of environmental and human health impact category suggest that growing the GM herbicide-tolerant crop would be le harmful to the environment and human health than growing the conventional crop , largely due to lower emission from herbicide manufacture , transport and field operation . Emissions contributing to negative environmental impact , such a global warming , ozone depletion , ecotoxicity of water and acidification and nutrification of soil and water , were much lower for the herbicide-tolerant crop than for the conventional crop . Emissions contributing to summer smog , toxic particulate matter and carcinogenicity , which have negative human health impact , were also substantially lower for the herbicide-tolerant crop . The environmental and human health impact of growing GM crop need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis using a holistic approach . LCA is a valuable technique for helping to undertake such assessment .

aVEnvironmental aspect of using supercritical water oxidation ( SCWO ) to treat sewage sludge were studied using a life cycle assessment ( LCA ) methodology . The system studied is the first commercial scale SCWO plant for sewage sludge in the world , treating sludge from the municipal wastewater treatment facility in Harlingen , TX , USA . The environmental impact were evaluated using three specific environmental attribute : global warming potential ( GWP ) , photo-oxidant creation potential ( POCP ) and resource depletion ; a well a two single point indicator : EPS2000 and EcoIndicator99 . The LCA result show that for the described process , gas-fired preheating of the sludge is the major contributor to environmental impact , and emission from generating electricity for pumping and for oxygen production are also important . Overall , SCWO processing of undigested sewage sludge is an environmentally attractive technology , particularly when heat is recovered from the process . Energy-conserving measure and recovery of excess oxygen from the SCWO process should be considered for improving the sustainability potential . ( C ) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All right reserved .

aVEnvironmental problem caused by energy using threaten the world . High CO2 emission emitted into the atmosphere by combustion of fossil fuel cause global warming . Result of combustion of fossil fuel used for heating building , air pollution occurs much more in cold city like Erzurum . Erzurum is one of the coldest city of Turkey . Low quality fuel consumption together with the increasing energy demand for space heating have caused very high air pollution and poor air quality on occasion during heating period in Erzurum . Thus , in this work , we investigated environmental impact of heat insulation used for reduction heat loss in building . In this analysis , it ha been determined that CO2 emission amount decreased 50 % by mean of optimum insulation thickness used and other energy saving method in building . ( C ) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

aVSoils have been proposed a carbon storage sink to help reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide level and global warming . Benefits could accrue to farmer , due to beneficial effect of soil organic carbon on productivity , and to society by managing land to increase soil carbon . Measurements are needed to determine if practice aimed at increasing carbon level are effective and to quantify amount of carbon stored for verification purpose . However , measurement are expensive and have high error relative to annual change in soil carbon . In this article , we develop an Ensemble Kalman filter ( EnKF ) approach that combine measurement with prediction from a simple model , taking into account error in measurement , model parameter , and model prediction . The EnKF wa used to estimate soil carbon at annual time step and to estimate an uncertain soil carbon decomposition rate parameter A sensitivity analysis wa conducted to evaluate the effect on EnKF estimate of uncertainty in measurement , model prediction , and the decomposition rate parameter The EnKF estimate of soil carbon were compared with true value that were generated using a Monte Carlo method . Results showed that EnKF estimate of soil carbon level and annual change of soil carbon were more accurate than measurement alone for all combination of condition studied . The root mean square error of estimation wa reduced from around 700 kg/ha based on measurement alone to about 225 kg/ha using the EnKF procedure . The unknown soil carbon decomposition parameter converged to it true value after about seven year . This EnKF method can be modified to incorporate more comprehensive model of croppings system and soil carbon , to incorporate spatial variability , and to assimilate remote sensing input . It is simple to implement and ha considerable promise for practical use in soil carbon sequestration project .

aVDuring deglaciation of the North American Laurentide Ice Sheet large proglacial lake developed in position where proglacial drainage wa impeded by the ice margin . For some of these lake , it is known that subsequent drainage had an abrupt and widespread impact on North Atlantic Ocean circulation and climate , but le is known about the impact that the lake exerted on ice sheet dynamic . This paper report palaeogeographic reconstruction of the evolution of proglacial lake during deglaciation across the northwestern Canadian Shield , covering an area in excess of 1,000,000 km ( 2 ) a the ice sheet retreated some 600 km . The interaction between proglacial lake and ice sheet flow are explored , with a particular emphasis on whether the disposition of lake may have influenced the location of the Dubawnt Lake ice stream . This ice stream fall outside the existing paradigm for ice stream in the Laurentide Ice Sheet because it did not operate over fined-grained till or lie in a topographic trough . Ice margin position and a digital elevation model are utilised to predict the geometry and depth of proglacial take impounded at the margin at 30-km increment during deglaciation . Palaeogeographic reconstruction match well with previous independent estimate of lake coverage inferred from field evidence , and result suggest that the development of a deep lake in the Thelon drainage basin may have been influential in initiating the ice stream by inducing calving , drawing down ice and triggering fast ice flow . This is the only location alongside this sector of the ice sheet where large ( > 3000 km ( 2 ) ) , deep lake ( similar to120 m ) are impounded for a significant length of time and exactly match the location of the ice stream . It is speculated that the commencement of calving at the ice sheet margin may have taken the system beyond a threshold and wa sufficient to trigger rapid motion but that once initiated , calving process and loss were insignificant to the functioning of the ice stream . It is thus concluded that proglacial lake are likely to have been an important control on ice sheet dynamic during deglaciation of the Laurentide Ice Sheet . ( C ) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

aVThis paper examines what can be known about transport technology and travel volume out to the year 2050 , mainly in the industrialised country . Analysis of the past 50 year in transport show that adoption of radically new technology ha been comparatively slow . Travel volume and vehicle fleet have risen roughly in step with national income . The next half-century , however , will likely see major change in transport technology and fuel , in response to perceived constraint like oil depletion and global warming . The inevitable uncertainty in long-term forecasting will be exacerbated by these constraint . A break in the travel/ income relationship , a ha already happened with the energy/income relationship , is also probable . Responding to an uncertain future will prove difficult if change is left largely to market force . Instead , a larger role for government can both reduce uncertainty and provide u with a more sustainable transport system .

aVDetermining the spread and potential geographical distribution of invasive specie is integral to making invasion biology a predictive science . We assembled a dataset of over 1000 occurrence of the Argentine ant ( Linepithema humile ) , one of the world 's worst invasive alien specie . Native to central South America , Argentine ant are now found in many Mediterranean and subtropical climate around the world . We used this dataset to ass the specie ' potential geographical and ecological distribution , and to examine change in it distributional potential associated with global climate change , using technique for ecological niche modelling . Models developed were highly predictive of the specie ' overall range , including both the native distributional area and invaded area worldwide . Despite it already widespread occurrence , L. humile ha potential for further spread , with tropical coastal Africa and southeast Asia apparently vulnerable to invasion . Projecting ecological niche model onto four general circulation model scenario of future ( 2050s ) climate provided scenario of the specie ' potential for distributional expansion with warming climate : generally , the specie wa predicted to retract it range in tropical region , but to expand at higher latitude area .

aVChina is the largest producer of magnesium in the world . and supply currently 40-50 % of the world demand for magnesium . The current growth in the demand for magnesium is primarily driven by automotive industry for light weighting automobile to reduce emission . Magnesium production in China is based on a thermal process , known a the Pidgeon process that wa originally invented in Canada in the 1940s . The raw material used is dolomite , which is initially calcined , and the calcined dolomite is reduced using the Pidgeon process by supplying ferrosilicon and thermal energy to produce pure magnesium crown . The magnesium crown are then melted and cast a pure magnesium ingot , which are then exported from China to meet the growing world demand . With a focus on the global warming impact , a cradle-to-gate life cycle study is conducted using averaged data for magnesium production in China . Calculations show that the cradle-to-gate global warming impact of Chinese magnesium ingot is 42 kg CO2 eq/kg Mg ingot , within an uncertain range of 37-47 kg CO2 eq/kg Mg ingot . The value of impact for the magnesium produced in China is similar to60 % higher than the global warming impact of aluminium , a competing material that is also produced in China in abundance . The calculated impact for magnesium is discussed in the context of the future magnesium product value chain that may have a strong dependence on the magnesium produced in China .

aVResearch on the geological data of Hunshandake Desert in China monsoon region revealed that Holocene summer monsoon had experienced six prevailing period and seven weakening period . The climatic humidity and the vegetation had also undergone the similar periodical variation influenced by the monsoon periodicity . The period when summer monsoon prevailed or winter monsoon weakened and climatic humidity and vegetation coverage relatively increased , corresponded to the global warming event ; whereas the period when summer monsoon weakened or winter monsoon prevailed and climatic humidity and vegetation coverage relatively decreased , corresponded to the and event in middle to low latitude and the cold event in North Atlantic . As for the changing regularity of summer monsoon intensity there were two distinct periodicity of 1456 year and 494 year , also these two periodicity had global significance .

aVThe behavior of the coupled carbon cycle and physical climate system in a global warming scenario is studied using an Earth system model including the atmosphere , land , ocean , and the carbon cycle embedded in these component . A fully coupled carbon-climate simulation and several sensitivity run were conducted for the period of 1860 - 2100 with prescribed IPCC-SRES-A1B emission scenario . Results indicate a positive feedback to global warming from the interactive carbon cycle , with an additional increase of 90 ppmv in the atmospheric CO ( 2 ) , and 0.6 degree additional warming , thus confirming recent result from the Hadley Centre and IPSL . However , the change in various carbon pool are more modest , largely due to the multiple limiting factor constraining terrestrial productivity and carbon loss . The large difference among the three model are manifestation of some of the poorly constrained process such a the global strength of the CO ( 2 ) fertilization effect and the turnover time and rate of soil decomposition .

aVWhile the global rise in mean day/night and seasonal air temperature ( ATE ) of recent decade is well documented , it influence on level of soil-sequestered organic carbon , and on emission rate of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emanating therefrom , is only beginning to garner serious attention . This ha resulted in a limited but growing understanding , particularly in the context of the land of the Chinese subcontinent , of the mechanism underlying such emission . Some 340 soil sample from 12 different sandy land region in China were analyzed for soil organic carbon ( SOC ) content . Stepwise regression identified correlation between SOC and a number of climatic factor measured at the sampling site : winter , summer , nighttime and daytime ATE , and precipitation . In desertified land , net SOC loss showed a direct correlation with precipitation but no significant relationship with mean ATE . However , in northwest and northeast China , decrease in SOC were linked to rise in day/night and seasonal ATE , while in north central China they were linked to a rise in mean ATE . Between 1900 and 1998 , mean ATE in the northwest , northeast , and north central region rose by 0.14E , 0.28E , and 0.15E decade ( -1 ) , respectively . Meanwhile , precipitation dropped by 25 mm decade ( -1 ) across these region . In this study , day/night and seasonal ATE showed differing level of significance with respect to their linear relationship with SOC content . Driven by rise in day/night and seasonal ATE , long-term alteration to global ecosystemic process , particularly the carbon cycle , may quantitatively and qualitatively alter the flora of desertified ecosystem . Our study suggests that , over the last 40 year , anthropogenic factor , precipitation , and rise in ATE ( particularly nighttime and winter ) have contributed 47 % , 26 % , and 20 % , respectively , of greenhouse gas emission from SOC . It is apparent that for China 's desertified land , human activity is the primary causative factor in the release of SOC-derived greenhouse gas to the atmosphere , while geography and climatic extreme individually play a lesser role .

aVThis study wa undertaken to ass the impact of global warming on the production in Japan of apple ( Malus domestica Borkh . ) and satsuma mandarin ( Citrus unshiu Marc. ) . The annual mean temperature wa used to simulate possible change in favorable region for the cultivation of apple and satsuma mandarin . The temperature range assumed to be appropriate for fruit production were 6-14 degreesC and 7-13 degreesC for apple and 15-18 degreesC for satsuma mandarin , respectively . The database of `` Climate Change Mesh Data ( Japan ) '' wa used to calculate annual mean temperature under the climate change scenario , derived from four Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models ( AOGCM ) at all 10 X 10 km mesh . It wa predicted that the favorable region to cultivate apple and satsuma mandarin will gradually move northward . In 2060 's the plain of central Tohoku will be unfavorable for apple cultivation , while most of Hokkaido will be suitable . The plain of northern Tohoku are predicted to attain the annual mean temperature higher than those of the current main producing district . By 2060 's , the favorable area for satsuma mandarin production will possibly move from the southern coastal site to inland area of western and southern Japan , the plain of Kanto and the littoral zone of the Japan Sea in the central and western Japan and in southern Tohoku . Therefore , global warming will greatly affect the cultivation environment of apple and satsuma mandarin in Japan by the middle of the 21st century .

aVIn recent decade China ha pursued a number of national energy policy a integral component of it 5-year development plan including the unprecedented dissemination of several generation of fuel saving stove in the majority of it rural population . These program , although designed for conservation of fuel wood resource and using deceptively simple technology , have much wider impact on both a national and a global level through their impact on health and emission of pollutant that have warming consequence for the atmosphere . In the current manuscript we examine these implication using emission data collected a part of a comprehensive evaluation of 28 typical stove/fuel technology in common use . We illustrate that relative benefit of biomass and fossil fuel , and subsequently policy regarding promotion of different fuel type , are dependent on which product of incomplete combustion are considered . if one only considers gas included within the Kyoto protocol , the burning of renewably harvested biomass appears to have an advantage over kerosene or LPG a a large component of PIC emission from inefficient biomass stove are not included in the calculation . If , however , one considers a more comprehensive list of compound that have direct or indirect effect on global warming , at best the burning of fuel wood when 100 % renewably harvested ha a similar GWC to these better quality fuel , and , under condition experienced in many rural area of the world , often considerably worse . Comprehensive evaluation would require all major radiative forcing agent to be considered , even though that present considerable difficulty considering reported uncertainty of some global warming potential . The stove type in this study demonstrated a wide range of emission factor . This offer an effective mechanism for achieving short-term reduction in emission of health damaging pollutant , and also accomplishes the longer-term goal of reducing of greenhouse gas emission . Not all the improved stove resulted in benefit on all level , however , and it is possible , therefore , to implement policy with the best intention for alleviating the burden of collecting fuel , which may actually , result in increased exposure of the population to health damaging pollutant and increased global warming contribution . In addition , the difference between global warming commitment for renewable and non-renewable harvesting of biomass fuel wa of such magnitude , especially compared to difference between stove type , that more detailed accounting of the renewable nature of the harvesting of biomass fuel is essential and ha profound implication for global accounting of carbon emission and credit through the clean development mechanism . Clearly , however , evaluation of biomass burning in residential stove requires a more holistic , or full fuel cycle approach that considers both the production of the fuel wood , the burning of the fuel , sequestration of gas during the next growing season and the environmental degradation and shift in fuel that may occur due to mining of the resource .

aVThe Greenland ice sheet is likely to make a faster contribution to sea-level rise in a warming world than previously believed , based on numerical modelling using a parameterization of recent result showing surface-meltwater lubrication of ice flow . Zwally et al . ( Science 297 ( 557 ) ( 2002 ) 218 ) documented correlation between increased ice velocity and increased surface melt ( a parameterized by positive degree day ) . They , argued that surface water is piped directly to the bed with little delay , causing increased basal-water pressure and basal-sliding velocity , an effect not included in recent Greenland ice-sheet model known to the author . Using , the Pennsylvania State University/University of Chicago thermomechanical flowline model , numerous Simulations were conducted to test a wide range of parameter space linking surface melt with a new sliding law based on the Zwally et al . data under three different global warming scenario ( 2 x CO2 , 4 x CO2 , and 8 x CO2 ) . Comparisons to reconstruction generated with a traditional sliding parameterization illustrate an enhanced sensitivity of the ice sheet to Surface warming resulting in higher ablation rate . additional thinning , and retreat of the margin , and a reduction in ice volume leading to an increased contribution to global sea-level rise .

aVIn response to growing environmental concern , we attempted to develop switchgear without using SF6 gas . In our research , we used compressed air and pure N-2 a an electrical insulation gas , because of their low global warming potential . In this paper , we examined the impulse breakdown and impulse partial discharge characteristic under various condition related to nonuniformity of the electric field . The experimental result show that the breakdown voltage ( BDV ) of air is higher than that of pure N-2 gas under highly nonuniform field condition in the rod-plane gap . On the other hand , the discharge inception voltage of air and N-2 were almost the same . Furthermore , first partial discharge ( PD ) , leader discharge , and it transition to the breakdown were successfully observed through the measurement of discharge current and light emission under impulse voltage application .

aVWe examined , under laboratory condition , the influence of temperature ( 2 degreesC vs. 10 degreesC ) on the physiological response of two aquatic bryophyte from a mountain stream to artificially enhanced UV-B radiation for 82 d. These organism may be exposed naturally to relatively low temperature and high level of UV-B radiation , and this combination is believed to increase the adverse effect of UV-B radiation . In the moss Fontinalis antipyretica , UV-B-treated sample showed severe physiological damage , including significant decrease in chlorophyll ( Chl ) and carotenoid ( Car ) content , Chl a/b and Chl/phaeopigment ratio , Chl a fluorescence parameter F-v/F-m and Phi ( PS2 ) , electron transport rate ( ETRmax ) , and growth . In the liverwort Jungermannia cordifolia , UV-B radiation hardly caused any physiological change except for growth reduction . Thus , this liverwort seemed to be more tolerant to UV-B radiation than the moss under the specific experimental condition used , maybe partly due to the accumulation of UV-B absorbing compound . The influence of temperature on the effect of UV-B radiation depended on the specie : the higher the UV-B tolerance , the lower the influence of temperature . Also , different physiological variable showed varied response to this influence . Particularly , the lower temperature used in our study enhanced the adverse effect of UV-B radiation on important physiological variable such a Fv/Fm , growth , and Chl/phaeopigment ratio in the UV-B-sensitive F antipyretica , but not in the more UV-B-tolerant J. cordifolia . Thus , the adverse effect of cold and UV-B radiation were apparently additive in the moss , but this additiveness wa lacking in the liverwort . The Principal Components Analyses ( PCA ) conducted for both specie with the physiological data obtained after 36 and 82 d of culture confirmed the above result . Under natural condition , the relatively high water temperature in summer might facilitate the acclimation of aquatic bryophyte from mountain stream to high level of UV-B radiation . This may be relevant to predict the consequence of concomitant global warming and increasing UV-B radiation .

aV[ 1 ] The slow eastward phase propagation of covarying sea surface temperature ( SST ) and sea level pressure ( SLP ) anomaly in the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave ( ACW ) persisted in the midlatitude Southern Ocean from 1950 to 2001 . Its northern extent reached into the subtropical South Indian and South Pacific ocean , where it influenced the magnitude and phase of El Nino in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean . This is corroborated by the observation that multidecadal change in the ACW can also explain multidecadal change in the way El Nino evolved over the last half of the twentieth century . Before 1977 , El Nino evolved from the slow eastward phase propagation of a coupled SST/SLP wave across the subtropical South Pacific Ocean to South America , then equatorward along the eastern boundary to the equator . During this epoch , the ACW expanded equatorward into a warmer subtropical South Pacific Ocean , accounting for the subtropical coupled SST/SLP wave that initiated El Nino . After 1977 , El Nino evolved from the slow eastward phase propagation of a coupled SST/SLP wave across the tropical Pacific Ocean . During this epoch , the ACW receded from a colder subtropical South Pacific Ocean but expanded into a warmer subtropical South Indian Ocean . There it spawned a coupled SST/SLP wave directed equatorward into the Warm Pool north of Australia , thereafter propagating eastward into the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean to initiate El Nino . If this pattern of global warming persists into the 21st century , then the ACW will continue to influence El Nino through the South Indian Ocean .

aVAtmospheric aerosol play an important role in global climate change , directly through radiative forcing and indirectly through their effect on cloud property . Numerous measurement have been performed in the last three decade in order to characterize polar aerosol . Information about aerosol characteristic is needed to calculate induced change in the Earth 's heat balance . However , this forcing is highly variable in space and time . Accurate quantification of forcing by aerosol will require combined effort , assimilating information from different source such a satellite , aircraft and surface-based observation . Adding to the complexity of the problem is that the measurement themselves are often not directly comparable a they vary in spatial/temporal resolution and in the basic property of the aerosol that they measure . Therefore it is desirable to close the gap between the difference in temporal and spatial resolution and coverage among the observational approach . In order to keep the entire information content and to treat aerosol variability in a consistent and manageable way an approach ha to be achieved which enables one to combine these data . This study present one possibility for linking together a complex Arctic aerosol data set in term of parameter , timescale and place of measurement a well a meteorological parameter . A cluster analysis wa applied a a pattern recognition technique . The data set is classified in cluster and expressed in term of mean statistical value , which represent the entire database and it variation . For this study , different time-series of microphysical , optical and chemical aerosol parameter a well a meteorological parameter were analysed . The database wa obtained during an extensive aerosol measurement campaign , the ASTAR 2000 ( Arctic Study of Tropospheric Aerosol and Radiation ) field campaign , with coordinated simultaneous ground-based and airborne measurement in the vicinity of Spitsbergen ( Svalbard ) . Furthermore , longterm measurement at two ground-based site situated at different altitude were incorporated into the analysis . The approach presented in this study allows the necessary linking of routine long-term measurement with short-term extensive observation . It also involves integration of intermittent vertical aerosol profile measurement . This is useful for many application , especially in climate research where the required data coverage is large .

aVIn this study , we present exact measure of the number , area , and basic morphometric statistic for every single reef of the Maldivian archipelago , a derived from the interpretation of remotely sensed data collected by the Landsat-7 ETM+ earth-observing satellite sensor . We classified and mapped seven morphological attribute of reef ( six marine habitat and reef-top island ) to 30-m depth at 30x30 m spatial resolution ( pixel size ) for the entire archipelago . The total archipelagic area ( all coral reef and lagoon habitat ) of the 16 atoll , five oceanic faro , and four oceanic platform reef which comprise the Maldives is 21,372.72+/-1,068.64 km ( 2 ) ( approx . 20 % of the Maldives ' Territorial Sea ) . A total of 2,041+/-10 distinct coral reef structure larger than 0.01 km ( 2 ) occur in the Maldives , covering an area of 4,493.85 km ( 2 ) ( including enclosed reef lagoon and island ) to 30-m depth . Smaller area of coral reef substratum cover another 19.29 km ( 2 ) , bringing the total area of Maldivian coral reef to 4,513.14+/-225.65 km ( 2 ) . Shallow coral platform thus occupy 21.1 % of the total area of the archipelago ( 0.0052 % of the EEZ area of the Maldives ) . Of these reef , 538 are rim and oceanic reef , covering 3,701.93 km ( 2 ) ( 82.5 % of the total reef area ) , and 1,503 are patch reef within the atoll lagoon , covering 791.92 km ( 2 ) ( 17.5 % of the total reef area ) . Islands occupy only 5.1 % of the total reef area . Mapping the Maldives ' coral reef at high spatial resolution is only possible with remote sensing and spatial analysis technology . These greatly reduce the large uncertainty around current estimate of reef area . Our accurate measure of total reef area is only 50.6 % of the current best estimate , a result having significant implication for prediction of the Maldives ' reef productivity and response to global climate change . Here we present current best practice and compare the method and measure with previous approach .

aVCoral reef are dominated by symbioses between marine invertebrate ( e.g . coral , clam , sea anemone , sponge ) and the dinoflagellate Symbiodinium . Increases in seawater temperature linked to global warming have lead to the phenomenon known a `` bleaching '' , involving the disassociation of these symbioses and mass mortality of the invertebrate host . Mass bleaching event have been linked to a thermal lesion in the photosynthesis of Symbiodinium , either at photosystem II or in the dark reaction of photosynthesis . Examination of two of the proposed lesion point , the carbon concentrating mechanism ( CCM ) and form II Rubisco , indicate that , over the temperature range examined , the CCM is not disrupted in Symbiodinium isolated from giant clam , however it wa not possible to determine if Rubisco is the point of thermal lesion resulting in bleaching . Maximum photosynthetic rate were measured between 28 and 31degreesC and declined a temperature wa increased . Despite a low correlation between Rubisco activity , oxygen evolution and temperature , Rubisco activity declined with increasing temperature .

aVGlaciers are highly responsive to global warming and important agent of landscape heterogeneity . While it is well established that glacial ablation and snowmelt regulate stream discharge , linkage among stream and streamwater geochemistry , the control of these factor on stream microbial biofilms remain insufficiently understood . We investigated glacial ( metakryal , hypokryal ) , groundwater-fed ( krenal ) and snow-fed ( rhithral ) streams-all of them representative for alpine stream networks-and present evidence that these hydrologic and hydrogeochemical factor differentially affect sediment microbial biofilms . Average microbial biomass and bacterial carbon production were low in the glacial stream , whereas bacterial cell size , biomass , and carbon production were higher in the tributary , most notably in the krenal stream . Whole-cell in situ fluorescence hybridization revealed reduced detection rate of the Eubacteria and higher abundance of alpha-Proteobacteria in the glacial stream , a pattern that most probably reflects the trophic status of this ecosystem . Our data suggest low flow during the onset of snowmelt and autumn a a short period ( hot moment ) of favorable environmental condition with pulsed input of allochthonous nitrate and dissolved organic carbon , and with disproportionately high microbial growth . Tributaries are relatively more constant and favorable environment than kryal stream , and serve a possible source of microbe and organic matter to the main glacial channel during period ( e.g. , snowmelt ) of elevated hydrologic linkage among stream . Ice and snow dynamics-and their impact on the amount and composition of dissolved organic matter-have a crucial impact on stream biofilms , and we thus need to consider microbe and critical hydrological episode in future model of alpine stream community .

aVUpper Devonian succession surrounding the Frasnian-Famennian ( F-F ) boundary in Iran consist of mixed carbonate/silisiclastic deposit . The succession are characterized by conspicuous ferruginous limestone , clay-rich unit , black shale , and mafic volcanic rock that provide important insight into palaeoenvironmental condition during this interval of Earth 's history . An increase of kaolinite/illite ratio in clay associated with the F-F boundary suggests that increased chemical weathering wa facilitated by warm and humid climatic condition . Distinctive ferruginous-oolite deposit overlying the crucial Frasnian-Famennian boundary interval indicate a high supply rate of Fe-bearing clay originated during enhanced weathering under such climatic condition . Black shale associated with the F-F boundary are interpreted to be the result of a high primary productivity caused by an increased influx of land-derived nutrient and regional volcanic activity . Widespread rift-related , basaltic activity along eastern Laurussia and northern Gondwana during the mid-Late Devonian is believed to have contribution to this global warming surrounding the F-F boundary .

aVAim Our aim were to quantify climatic and soil control on net primary productivity ( NPP ) and leaf area index ( LAI ) along subtropical to alpine gradient where the vegetation remains relatively undisturbed , and investigate whether NPP and LAI converge towards threshold-like logistic pattern associated with climatic and soil variable that would help u to verify and parameterize process model for predicting future ecosystem behaviour under global environmental change . Location Field data were collected from 22 site along the Tibetan Alpine Vegetation Transects ( TAVT ) during 1999-2000 . The TAVT included the altitudinal transect on the eastern slope of the Gongga Mountains in the Eastern Tibetan Plateau , with altitude from 1900 m to 3700 m , and the longitudinal-latitudinal transect in the Central Tibetan Plateau , of approximately 1000 km length and 40 km width . Methods LAI wa measured a the product of foliage biomass multiplied by the ratio of specific leaf area . NPP in forest and shrub community wa estimated a the sum of increase in standing crop of live vegetation using recent stem growth rate and leaf lifespan . NPP in grassland wa estimated from the above-ground maximum live biomass . We measured the soil organic carbon ( C ) and total and available nitrogen ( N ) content and their pool size by conventional method . Mean temperature for the year , January and July and annual precipitation were estimated from available meteorological station by interpolation or simulation . The threshold-like logistic function wa used to model the relationship of LAI and NPP with climatic and soil variable . Results Geographically , NPP and LAI both significantly decreased with increasing latitude ( P < 0.02 ) , but increased with increasing longitude ( P < 0.01 ) . Altitudinal trend in NPP and LAI showed different pattern . NPP generally decreased with increasing altitude in a linear relationship ( r ( 2 ) = 0.73 , P < 0.001 ) , whereas LAI showed a negative quadratic relationship with altitude ( r ( 2 ) = 0.58 , P < 0.001 ) . Temperature and precipitation , singly or in combination , explained 60-68 % of the NPP variation with logistic relationship , while the soil organic C and total N variable explained only 21-46 % of the variation with simple linear regression of log-transformed data . LAI showed significant logistic relationship with both climatic and soil variable , but the data from alpine spruce-fir site diverged greatly from the modelled pattern associated with temperature and precipitation . Soil organic C storage had the strongest correlation with LAI ( r ( 2 ) = 0.68 , P < 0.001 ) . Main conclusion In response to climatic gradient along the TAVT , LAI and NPP across diverse vegetation type converged towards threshold-like logistic pattern consistent with the general distribution pattern of live biomass both above-ground and below-ground found in our earlier study . Our analysis further revealed that climatic factor strongly limited the NPP variation along the TAVT because the precipitation gradient characterized not only the vegetation distribution but also the soil N condition of the natural ecosystem . LAI generally increased with increasing precipitation and wa well correlated with soil organic C and total N variable . The interaction between LAI growth and soil N availability would appear to have important implication for ecosystem structure and function of alpine spruce-fir forest . Convergence towards logistic pattern in dry matter production of plant in the TAVT suggests that alpine plant growth would increase in a nonlinear response to global warming .

aVDuring the 20th century , farmer around the world replaced legume rotation and other traditional source of nitrogen ( N ) fertility with synthetic N fertilizer . A sizable percentage of the human population now depends on synthetic N fertilizer for survival . In recent decade , N fertilizer have been linked to numerous environmental hazard including marine eutrophication , global warming , groundwater contamination , and stratospheric ozone destruction . Some researcher suggest that legume , which can support biological NZ fixation , offer a more environmentally sound and sustainable source of N to cropping system . This perspective is countered by researcher who argue that , ( 1 ) legume-derived N ha equally negative environmental impact a the N derived from synthetic fertilizer , and ( 2 ) the human population now exceeds the carrying capacity of agricultural system that depend on legume for N input . In this review , we compare the sustainability of obtaining N from legume versus industrial source in term of ecological integrity , energetics and food security . We conclude that obtaining N from legume is potentially more sustainable than from industrial source . We further suggest that while some country are fundamentally dependent on synthetic N for food production , many country have the capacity to greatly reduce or eliminate dependence on synthetic N through adoption of le meat-intensive diet , and reduction of food waste .

aVGoal , Scope and Background . The automotive industry ha a long history in improving the environmental performance of vehicle - fuel economy and emission improvement , introduction of recycled and renewable material , etc . The European Union also aim at improving the environmental performance of product by reducing , in particular , waste resulting from End-of-Life Vehicles ( ELVs ) for example . The European Commission estimate that ELVs contribute to approximately 1 % of the total waste in Europe [ 9 ] . Other European Union strategy are considering more life cycle aspect , a well a other impact including resource or climate change . This article is summarizing the result of a European Commission funded project ( LIRECAR ) that aim at identifying the environmental impact and relevance for combination of recycling / recovery and lightweight vehicle design option over the whole life cycle of a vehicle - i.e . manufacturing , use and recycling/recovery . Three , independent and scientific LCA expert reviewed the study according to ISO 14040 . From the beginning , representative of all Life Cycle Stakeholders have been involved ( European material & supplier association , an environmental Non-Governmental Organization , recycler 's association ) . Model and System Definition . The study compared 3 set of theoretical vehicle weight scenario : 1000 kg reference ( material range of today 's end-of-life , mid-sized vehicle produced in the early 1990 's ) and 2 lightweight scenario for 100 kg and 250 kg le weight based on reference function ( in term of comfort , safety , etc . ) and a vehicle concept . The scenario are represented by their material range of a broad range of lightweight strategy of most European car manufacturer . In parallel , three End-of-Life ( EOL ) scenario are considered : EOL today and two theoretical extreme scenario ( 100 % recycling , respectively , 100 % recovery of shredder residue fraction that are disposed of today ) . The technical and economical feasibility of the studied scenario is not taken into consideration ( e.g . 100 % recycling is not possible ) . Results and Discussion . Significant difference between the various , studied weight scenario were determined in several scenario for the environmental category of global warming , ozone depletion , photochemical oxidant creation ( summer smog ) , abiotic resource depletion , and hazardous waste . However , these improvement potential can be only realized under well defined condition ( e.g . material composition , specific fuel reduction value and EOL credit ) based on case-by-case assessment for improvement over the course of the life cycle . Looking at the studied scenario , the relative contribution of the EOL phase represents 5 % or le of the total life cycle impact for most selected impact category and scenario . The EOL technology variation studied do not impact significantly the considered environmental impact . Exceptions include total waste , a long a stockpile good ( overburden , tailing and ore/coal processing residue ) and EOL credit are considered . Conclusions and Recommendations . LIRECAR focus only on lightweight/recycling , question whereas other measure ( change in safety or comfort standard , propulsion improvement for COD user behavior ) are beyond the scope of the study . The conclusion are also not necessarily transferable to other vehicle concept . However , for the question of end-of-life option , it can be concluded that LIRECAR can not support any general recommendation and/or mandatory action to improve recycling if lightweight is affected . Also , looking at each vehicle , no justification could be found for the general assumption that lightweight and recycling greatly influence the affected environmental dimension ( Global Warming Potential or resource depletion and waste , respectively ) . LIRECAR showed that this general assumption is not true under all analyzed circumstance and not a significant a suggested . Further discussion and product development target shall not focus on generic target that define the approach/technology concerned with how to achieve environmental improvement ( weight reduction [ kg ] , recycling quota [ % ] ) , but on overall life cycle improvement ) . To enable this case-by-case assessment , exchange of necessary information with supplier are especially relevant .

aVThe Connecticut River historically represented the southernmost extent of the North American range of Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar ) , but the native population wa extirpated 200 year ago by dam construction . An extensive restoration effort ha relied upon stock transfer from more northerly river , especially the Penobscot River ( Maine ) . Recent work ha shown difference in age structure between donor and derivative population . Here we focus on a related life-history trait , the timing of the adult migration . We examined 23 year of migration timing data collected at two capture location in the Connecticut River drainage . We found that both date of first capture and median capture date have shifted significantly earlier by about 0.5 day ( . ) year ( -1 ) . To conclude whether this is a consequence of local adaptation or a coast-wide effect , we also quantified change in migration timing of more northerly stock ( in Maine and Canada ) . We found that the change in migration timing were not unique to the Connecticut River stock and instead observed coherent pattern in the shift towards earlier peak migration date across system . These consistent shift are correlated with long-term change in temperature and flow and may represent a response to global climate change .

aVClimate change is predicted to shorten the fire interval in boreal forest . Many study have recorded positive effect of fire on forest growth over a few decade , but few have modeled the long-term effect of the loss of carbon and nitrogen to the atmosphere . We used a process-based , dynamic , forest ecosystem model , which couple the carbon , nitrogen and water cycle , to simulate the effect of fire frequency on coniferous forest in the climate of Prince Albert , Saskatchewan . The model wa calibrated to simulate observed forest property . The model predicted rapid short-term recovery of net primary productivity ( NPP ) after fire , but in the long term , supported the hypothesis that ( 1 ) current NPP and carbon content of boreal forest are lower than they would be without periodic fire , and ( 2 ) any increase in fire frequency in the future will tend to lower NPP and carbon storage . Lower long-term NPP and carbon storage were attributable to ( 1 ) loss of carbon on combustion , equal to about 20 % of NPP over a 100-200 year fire cycle , ( 2 ) loss of nitrogen by volatilization in fire , equal to about 3-4 kg N ha ( -1 ) year ( -1 ) over a 100-200 year fire cycle , and ( 3 ) the fact that the normal fire cycle is much shorter than the time taken for the forest ( especially the soil ) to reach an equilibrium carbon and nitrogen content . It wa estimated that a shift in fire frequency from 200 to 100 year over 1000 Mha of boreal forest would release an average of about 0.1 Gt C year ( -1 ) over many century .

aVThe seasonal course of methane ( CH ( 4 ) ) and nitrous oxide ( N ( 2 ) O ) flux were simultaneously monitored in a paddy field using a closed chamber system with automated gas sampling and analyzing equipment . Water management and fertilizer application practice followed Japanese conventional one . CH ( 4 ) flux gradually increased after the first flood irrigation of the field and reached similar to150 mg CH ( 4 ) m ( -2 ) d ( -1 ) at the beginning of July . After the first summer drainage , however , CH ( 4 ) flux dropped rapidly to almost zero within a few day . CH ( 4 ) flux then gradually increased again according to intermittent flood irrigation , but wa much le than that before the first drainage . Immediately after the first flood irrigation , N ( 2 ) O flux rapidly increased , although it temporal peak lasted only within a few day . During the subsequent continuously and intermittently flooded period , N ( 2 ) O flux remained at almost zero until the final drainage , except for slight and temporal peak just after the top-dress application of supplemental fertilizer . About 1 week after the final drainage in autumn , N ( 2 ) O flux gradually increased , and the most significant high peak of N ( 2 ) O flux wa observed after the harvest of rice plant , which lasted for about 2 week . The amount of cumulative CH ( 4 ) and N ( 2 ) O emission throughout the whole year of 2002 were 3128 mg CH ( 4 ) m ( -2 ) and 60.2 mg N m ( -2 ) , respectively . Both the amount of cumulative CH ( 4 ) and N ( 2 ) O emission during the rice cultivation period were low compared with those reported in previous study . These result suggest the advantage of Japanese conventional water management and fertilizer application for reducing the combined effect for global warming by CH ( 4 ) and N ( 2 ) O emission from paddy field , since the practice of drainage and intermittent flood irrigation in summer markedly lessen CH ( 4 ) emission in the latter half of the rice cultivation period with little enhancement of N ( 2 ) O emission .

aVConstructed wetland for wastewater treatment have many advantage . They can be used for several purpose , for example , to reduce level of organic matter and nutrient , and to retain toxic metal . However , most wetland are inherently net source of gaseous compound like methane and nitrous oxide , which are of environmental concern due to their rapid current accumulation in the atmosphere and their potent global warming capacity . In order to determine the flux of methane from a constructed wetland a study wa conducted over two growth season on a pilot scale wetland constructed to reduce nutrient level in secondary treated wastewater . The emission for the spring to autumn period averaged 141 mg CH ( 4 ) m ( -2 ) d ( -1 ) ( S.D . = 187 ) , ranging from consumption of 375 mg CH ( 4 ) m ( -2 ) d ( -1 ) to emission of 1739 mg CH ( 4 ) m ( -2 ) d ( -1 ) . The spatial and temporal variation were large , but could be accounted for by measured environmental factor . Among these factor , sediment and water temperature were significant in all case and independent of the scale of analysis ( r ( 2 ) up to 0.88 ) . ( C ) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aV[ 1 ] We develop and use a new version of the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model ( TEM ) to study how rate of methane ( CH4 ) emission and consumption in high-latitude soil of the Northern Hemisphere have changed over the past century in response to observed change in the region 's climate . We estimate that the net emission of CH4 ( emission minus consumption ) from these soil have increased by an average 0.08 Tg CH4 yr ( -1 ) during the twentieth century . Our estimate of the annual net emission rate at the end of the century for the region is 51 Tg CH4 yr ( -1 ) . Russia , Canada , and Alaska are the major CH4 regional source to the atmosphere , responsible for 64 % , 11 % , and 7 % of these net emission , respectively . Our simulation indicate that large interannual variability in net CH4 emission occurred over the last century . Our analysis of the response of net CH4 emission to the past climate change suggest that future global warming will increase net CH4 emission from the Pan-Arctic region . The higher net CH4 emission may increase atmospheric CH4 concentration to provide a major positive feedback to the climate system .

aVMethane loss from uncovered portion of cattle dung slurry in biogas plant of various capacity ( 3 , 6 , 9 , and 85 m ( 3 ) ) are measured using closed chamber method . Measurements are conducted from January to December 2002 during a year . Mean methane flux from different exposed area of a biogas plant of 3 m ( 3 ) capacity are : ( i ) Inlet/outlet pipe ; 70 g/m ( 2 ) /d , ( ii ) Around gasholder ; 87 g/m ( 2 ) /d , and ( iii ) Slurry tank ; 41 g/m ( 2 ) /d , and increased by 15-20 per cent with the increase in plant capacity to 85 m ( 3 ) . Seasonal variation of slurry temperature strongly affect the methane emission . Emission rate during the summer are found to be high ( 125 , 179 , 230 and 230 g/m ( 2 ) /d , respectively , from the hold er side of 3 , 6 , 9 , and 85 m ( 3 ) ) at slurry temperature near optimum mesophilic range ( 32degrees C during June ) and drop down considerably ( 68 to 79 per cent ) during winter at slurry temperature in the lower psychrophilic range ( 13degrees C in December ) . The correlation coefficient between the CH4 flux and the slurry temperature is found to be positive ( between 0.90 and 0.96 ) and significant .

aVIncreased decomposition rate in boreal peatlands with global warming might increase the release of atmospheric greenhouse gas , thereby producing a positive feedback to global warming . How temperature influence microbial decomposers is unclear . We measured in vitro rate of decomposition of senesced sedge leaf and rhizome ( Carex aquatilis ) , from a fen , and peat moss ( Sphagnum fuscum ) , from a bog , at 14 and 20degreesC by the three most frequently isolated fungi and bacteria from these material . Decomposition rate of the bog litter decreased ( 5- to 17-fold ) with elevated temperature , and decomposition of the sedge litter wa either enhanced ( 2- to 30-fold ) or remained unaffected by elevated temperature . The increased temperature regime always favoured fungal over bacterial decomposition rate ( 2- to 3-fold ) . Different physiological characteristic of these microbe suggest that fungi using polyphenolic polymer a a carbon source cause greater mass loss of these litter . Litter quality exerted a stronger influence on decomposition at elevated temperature , a litter rich in nutrient decomposed more quickly than litter poorer in nutrient at higher temperature ( 8.0 % -25.7 % for the sedge litter vs. 0.2 % for the bryophyte litter ) . We conclude that not all peatlands may provide a positive feedback to global warming . Cautious extrapolation of our data to the ecosystem level suggests that decomposition rate in fen may increase and those in bog may decrease under a global warming scenario .

aVIn recent year , Kilimanjaro and it vanishing glacier have become an 'icon ' of global warming , attracting broad interest . In this paper , a synopsis of ( a ) field observation made by the author and ( b ) climatic data a reported in the literature ( proxy and long-term instrumental data ) is presented to develop a new concept for investigating the retreat of Kilimanjaro 's glacier . based on the physical understanding of glacier-climate interaction . The concept considers the peculiarity of the mountain and implies that climatological process other than air temperature control the ice recession in a direct manner . A drastic drop in atmospheric moisture at the end of the 19th century and the ensuing drier climatic condition are likely forcing glacier retreat on Kilimanjaro . Future investigation using the concept a a governing hypothesis will require research at different climatological scale . Copyright ( C ) 2004 Royal Meteorological Society .

aV1 . The population of sperm whale ( Physeter macrocephalus ) in the South Pacific is divided into at least five sympatric vocal clan that almost certainly reflect cultural variation . 2 . We investigated difference in movement and feeding success of group from different clan off the Galapagos Islands and northern Chile , using data from 87 day spent tracking group of known clan . 3.Groups from different clan showed different use of habitat and movement pattern . Off the Galapagos Islands , 'Plus-one ' clan group moved in relatively straight line while 'Regular ' clan group had more convoluted track and a more inshore distribution , pattern which were consistent across year . 4 . Groups from different clan had different defecation rate , indicating between-clan variation in feeding success . Off the Galapagos Islands , 'Plus-one ' clan group were more successful in the depauperate ENSO ( 'El Nino/Southern Oscillation ' ) condition of 1987 . However , in the cooler condition of 1989 , group of the 'Regular ' clan had much higher feeding success than those of the 'Plus-one ' clan . 5 . Thus we suggest that cultural inheritance in sperm whale incorporates foraging strategy a well a vocal pattern , and that clan membership ha fitness consequence . 6 . That clan seem differentially affected by altered climate condition ha implication for the effect of global warming on sperm whale . 7 . The result also support the hypothesis that culturally determined difference in fitness may have affected genetic evolution through the process of cultural hitchhiking .

aVApproximately 400 people die from extreme heat each year in the United States , and the risk of heat wave may increase a a result of global climate change . Despite the risk of heat-related morbidity and mortality , many city lack written heat response plan . In a review of plan from 18 city at risk for heat-related mortality , we found that many city had inadequate or no heat response plan . This is an important area for further investigation and government attention .

aVThe Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum ( PETM ) wa an abrupt global warming event at similar to 55 Ma . This event had profound effect on the . biosphere . Quantitative investigation of calcareous nannofossil assemblage were performed across the PETM , at Deep Sea Drilling Project Site 213 , in the tropical Indian Ocean , and Site 401 , in the Bay of Biscay , North Atlantic Ocean , at a temperate latitude . Calcareous nannofossil assemblage from both site show major change before , during , and after the PETM . Fluctuations at Site 213 are affected by selective dissolution of the least robust taxon . By contrast , assemblage in the lower part of the PETM at Site 401 show le diagenetic alteration and display high abundance of genus such a Discoaster , Fasciculithus , and Ericsonia . These taxon reflect relatively warm and , probably , oligotrophic surface water . Abundances of the genus Chiasmolithus , an indicator of relatively cool and eutrophic water , decreased dramatically . The upper portion of the PETM is characterized by an increase in the abundance of Toweius spp . and Zygrhablithus bijugatus , interpreted a a return to cooler and more eutrophic condition . The elimination of Fasciculithus wa probably due to competition with the holococcolith specie , Z. bijugatus , which occupied the same ecological niche . The occurrence of long-armed and asymmetrical Discoaster specie such a Discoaster araneus , Discoaster anartios , and Discoaster okadai , and Rhomboaster specie , such a Rhomboaster calcitrapa and Rhomboaster cuspis , are characteristic of the PETM interval .

aVBiological N ( 2 ) fixation ( BNF ) by associative diazotrophic bacteria is a spontaneous process where soil N is limited and adequate C source are available . Yet the ability of these bacteria to contribute to yield in crop is only partly a result of BNF . A range of diazotrophic plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria participate in interaction with C ( 3 ) and C ( 4 ) crop plant ( e.g . rice , wheat , maize , sugarcane and cotton ) , significantly increasing their vegetative growth and grain yield . We review the potential of these bacteria to contribute to yield increase in a range of field crop and outline possible strategy to obtain such yield increase more reliably . The mechanism involved have a significant plant growth-promoting potential , retaining more soil organic-N and other nutrient in , the plant-soil system , thus reducing the need for fertiliser N and P. Economic and environmental benefit can include increased income from high yield , reduced fertiliser cost and reduced emission of the greenhouse gas , N ( 2 ) O ( With More than 300 time the global warming effect of CO ( 2 ) ) , a well a reduced leaching of NO ( 3 ) ( - ) -N to ground water . Obtaining maximum benefit on farm from diazotrophic , plant growth promoting biofertilisers will require a systematic strategy designed to fully utilise all these beneficial factor , allowing crop yield to be maintained or even increased while fertiliser application are reduced .

aVThe Initial Eocene Thermal Maximum ( IETM ) at c. 55 Ma represents a period of rapid global warming that lasted le than 200 ka . The response of vegetation to such an event , and particularly warm-adapted highly diverse vegetation type , is poorly understood . Using pollen floral , clay mineral and stable carbon isotope analysis of sediment from the upper Tuscahoma Formation on the eastern US Gulf Coast ( eastern Mississippi and western Alabama ) , we document paratropical floral change across the Palaeocene-Eocene boundary from the Wahalak # 2 and lower Harrell core . Data indicate strong change in the abundance of kaolinite that correlate with change in relative abundance of native pollen taxon . There is no evidence for a transient , extra-tropical flora on the US Gulf Coast that may characterize the IETM . Immigration and extinction are not associated with this event . Instead , Early Eocene plant immigration occurs in pulse and therefore is not associated directly with climate change during the IETM . The two core share the same regional specie pool but compositional difference are stronger between core than they are either through change in environment , increased soil erosion or chemical weathering , or through the introduction of non-native plant . Our data suggest that vegetation change across the Palaeocene-Eocene boundary is not a single event but rather a sequence of cascading event .

aVThe relationship between permafrost condition and the distribution of infrastructure in the Usa Basin , Northeast European Russia , is analyzed . About 75 % of the Basin is underlain by permafrost terrain with various degree of continuity ( isolated patch to continuous permafrost ) . The region ha a high level of urban and industrial development ( e.g. , town , coal mine , hydrocarbon extraction site , railway , pipeline ) . GIS-analyses indicate that about 60 % of all infrastructure is located in the 'high risk ' perma-frost area , here defined a the zone of isolated to discontinuous permafrost ( 3-90 % coverage ) with 'warm ' ground temperature ( 0 to -2degreesC ) . Ground monitoring , aerial photo interpretation , and permafrost modeling suggest a differential response to future global warming . Most of the permafrost-affected terrain will likely start to thaw within a few decade to a century . This forecast pose serious challenge to permafrost engineering and call for long-term investment in adequate infrastructure that will payback overtime .

aVElevated CO2 potentially decrease the effect of temperature stress on photosynthesis . Under both freezing and high temperature previous study have shown that elevated CO2 can particularly enhance photosynthetic rate , although result from freezing study are more variable . Here we show gas exchange response of Larrea tridentata to elevated CO2 over a 6-yr. period when temperature stress event may have had a significant effect on photosynthesis in the field . Nighttime freezing air temperature decreased subsequent daytime photosynthetic rate , stomatal conductance , and the maximum yield of PSII similarly under ambient and elevated CO2 . Further , we found no statistically significant relationship between leaf temperature and photosynthetic enhancement . Overall , the degree of photosynthetic enhancement under elevated CO2 wa directly proportional to the response of stomatal conductance to CO2 . Thus , elevated CO2 doe not significantly affect apparent physiological response of Larrea to temperature extreme . However , because of the tight relationship between stomatal conductance and photosynthetic enhancement , potential climate change effect on stomatal conductance will significantly influence Larrea performance in the future .

aVThe influence of periodic salinity change wa investigated for 42 day under semicontinuous culture condition with phosphorus limitation using phytoplankton assemblage from Lake Waihola , a tidally influenced shallow lake . To simulate tidal effect on the phytoplankton community , salinity in the culture wa increased in pulse at different interval ( 3.5 , 7 , and 14 day ) , and these culture were compared with those that experienced constant freshwater condition . Salinity pulse significantly affected competition and succession with a major loss in diversity during the first day of the experiment due to the initial pulse that caused a transition from freshwater to brackish condition in the culture . After this initial phase , diversity index ( H ' ) and specie number ( S-corr ) decreased le rapidly . The loss in H ' and S-corr over time wa highest under constant freshwater condition and lowest in the treatment with an interval of 3.5 day between salinity pulse . At the end of the experiment , the combination of initial loss in H ' and S-corr and the time course of H ' and S-corr resulted in a U-shaped relation between the interval length of salinity pulse and both H ' and S ( corr ) temp1.txttemp1.txt . Our result indicate that salinity pulse at interval of a few day tend to promote phytoplankton diversity . If saline intrusion in coastal freshwater system occur only at spring tide , this will lead to decrease in diversity and specie richness .

aVDescent of air from stratosphere to troposphere in Antarctic winter is proposed to be feasible , because of forcing from above by subsidence plus wave-breaking , together with suction from below to resupply the katabatic wind which flow down the slope of the Antarctic Plateau in the boundary layer . In Antarctic winter , there is no real tropopause to prevent such descent , hence the quote in the title : the temperature profile is often that of a radiative equilibrium atmosphere . Such descent would be important because the dryness and low precipitation over the Antarctic Plateau would be le altered during global warming , because there would be an alternative fractionation pathway for H2O18 and HDO in Antarctic ice-cores , and because the ozone budget in the unpolluted troposphere of the southern hemisphere would be significantly different . Each of these feature could have a major impact on climate or on the study of climate . ( C ) 2003 COSPAR . Published by Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVSeasonal dissolved organic carbon ( DOC ) accumulation and potential subsequent export , in addition to particulate organic carbon ( POC ) gravitational export , can be an important pathway of carbon removal from the surface ocean ( > 100 m ) at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study ( BATS ) . We have compiled available data on seasonal DOC accumulation and POC flux during the course of the winter/spring bloom and examined some potential control on the interannual variability of organic carbon partitioning between these two fate . When expressed a a fraction of the cumulative primary production , there wa a significant negative relationship between seasonal DOC accumulation and POC flux . Over the course of the BATS data record two group of phytoplankton , Haptophytes and Prochlorophytes , account for similar to60 % of the integrated ( 0-140m ) chlorophyll biomass . Variability in the relative abundance of Haptophytes and Prochlorophytes wa significantly correlated to the export of carbon , with increased relative abundance of Haptophytes correlated with higher seasonal accumulation of DOC and lower POC flux . Variability in the abundance of Haptophytes during the winter/spring period wa found to correlate negatively with the winter North Atlantic Oscillation ( NAO ) index . This relationship suggests that Haptophytes are a more important component of the phytoplankton community when a negative NAO phase enhances winter/spring mixing in the Sargasso Sea . These finding support a recent hypothesis that the increased stratification in the North Atlantic due to global warming could favor the blooming of diatom over Haptophytes . ( C ) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

aVQuestion : How much is the probability distribution of Fagus crenata forest predicted to change under a climate change scenario by the 2090s , and what are the potential impact on these forest ? What are the main factor inducing such change ? Location : The major island of Japan . Methods : A predictive distribution model wa developed with four climatic factor ( summer precipitation , PRS ; winter precipitation , PRW ; minimum temperature of the coldest month , TMC ; and warmth index , WI ) and five non-climatic factor ( topography , surface geology , soil , slope aspect and inclination ) . A climate change scenario wa applied to the model . Results : Areas with high probability ( > 0.5 ) were predicted to decrease by 91 % , retreating from the southwest , shrinking in central region , and expanding northeastward beyond their current northern limit . A vulnerability index ( the reciprocal of the predicted probability ) suggests that Kyushu , Shikoku , the Pacific Ocean side of Honshu and southwest Hokkaido will have high number of many vulnerable F. crenata forest . The forest with high negative sensitivity index ( the difference between simulated probability of occurrence under current and predicted climate ) mainly occur in southwest Hokkaido and the Sea of Japan side of northern Honshu . Conclusion : F. crenata forest distribution may retreat from some island due to a high WI . The predicted northeastward shift in northern Hokkaido is associated with increased TMC and PRS . High vulnerability and negative sensitivity of the forest in southern Hokkaido are due to increased WI .

aVThere is an ongoing important debate about the role of water vapour in climate change . Predictions of future climate change depend strongly on the magnitude of the water vapour feedback and until now model have almost exclusively been relied upon to quantify this feedback . In this work we employ observation of water vapour change , together with detailed radiative calculation to estimate the water vapour feedback for the case of the Mt . Pinatubo eruption . We then compare our observed estimate with that calculated from a relatively large ensemble of simulation from a complex coupled climate model . We calculate an observed water vapour feedback parameter of -1.6 Wm ( -2 ) K-1 , with uncertainty placing the feedback parameter between -0.9 to -2.5 Wm ( -2 ) K-1 . The uncertain is principally from natural climate variation that contaminate the volcanic cooling . The observed estimate are consistent with that found in the climate model , with the ensemble average model feedback parameter being -2.0 Wm ( -2 ) K-1 , with a 5-95 % range of -0.4 to -3.6 Wm ( -2 ) K-1 ( a in the case of the observation , the spread is due to an inability to separate the forced response from natural variability ) . However , in both the upper troposphere and Southern Hemisphere the observed model water vapour response differs markedly from the observation . The observed range represents a 40 % -400 % increase in the magnitude of surface temperature change when compared to a fixed water vapour response and is in good agreement with value found in other study . Variability , both in the observed value and in the climate model 's feedback parameter , between different ensemble member , suggests that the long-term water vapour feedback associated with global climate change could still be a factor of 2 or 3 different than the mean observed value found here and the model water vapour feedback could be quite different from this value ; although a small water vapour feedback appears unlikely . We also discus where in the atmosphere water vapour change have their largest effect on surface climate .

aVThe raccoon ( Procyon lotor ) ha greatly expanded it range in the Canadian prairie during the 1900s . Four non-exclusive explanation may explain this range expansion : introduction , mesopredator release , availability and suitability of winter denning site , and food availability . No introduction of raccoon were documented for the prairie , suggesting that range expansion wa not directly caused by human . The suggestion that raccoon moved north because of `` mesopredator release '' appears implausible because , even where larger predator such a bobcat ( Lynx rufus ) and coyote ( Canis latrans ) exist , raccoon experience low predation rate and also because raccoon have expanded their range into treeless area where coyote are abundant . The third hypothesis , suggesting that availability of winter denning site limit raccoon distribution , also receives little support , mostly because of the raccoon 's flexibility in using a variety of natural and anthropogenic structure for denning . The last hypothesis , the idea that raccoon range expansion ha followed an increase in availability of food , appears most plausible . The effect of global warming , which affect not only the availability and diversity of food but also the duration of the growing season ( and thus temporal availability of food ) , probably helped raccoon colonize new area .

aVTube hydroforming is a process for manufacturing highly rigid light-weight part with complex cross section by internal high-pressure and axial feeding or axial compressive loading . It offer some advantage when compared with the traditional manufacturing method such a sheet stamping and welding , or casting . The essential advantage are : integration of part , reduction in both component weight and manufacturing step , high accuracy of shape and dimension , etc . Tube hydroforming wa developed a an innovative technology in Japan over 40 year ago . Initially , it wa available for manufacturing small and simple part and ha been used mainly in both the bicycle industry and the piping industry to manufacture fitting . Recently , new computer technology offer advanced control technology in manufacturing large and complex part , and also offer FE simulation a designing tool for manufacturing sound part without failure , such a bursting , buckling or wrinkling . Tube hydroforming-refined by computer technology and increased in capacity-is widely regarded a a new technology for manufacturing light-weight part . To meet strong demand for saving fossil fuel and reducing CO2 emission which cause global warming , automobile industry have recently adopted tube hydroforming technology to reduce the total weight of the car and cost of production . This paper review the recent development of tube hydroforming and discus the key point of this technology .

aVWe studied the small-scale vegetation pattern in the high Arctic at Ny Angstromlesund to ass if the plant distribution wa related to periglacial landforms . The whole area ha been deglaciated for millennium but only a modest part of the area wa covered by mature vegetation . The plant cover varied considerably in relation to ground patterning originated by periglacial process , especially frost heave , frost creep , gelifluction and ice segregation , giving rise to a mosaic of microhabitats sharply differing from each other a regard physical property and microclimate . The distributional pattern of vascular plant , lichen and bryophyte were primarily affected by complex response to substrate texture , soil moisture content and substrate disturbance . Since global warming will probably affect both periglacial process and plant response to altered habitat condition , we concluded that long-term monitoring of relationship between landforms and vegetation represents a suitable tool for assessing the impact of global change on arctic region .

aVPathogens and herbivore can severely reduce host fitness , potentially leading to altered succession rate and change in plant community composition . Thus , to predict vegetation dynamic under climate change , it is necessary to understand how plant pathogen and herbivore will respond . Pathogens and herbivore are predicted to increase under climate warming because the amount of time available for growth and reproduction will increase . To test this prediction , we used a warming experiment in which heater were suspended over a natural montane meadow for 12 year . In the summer of 2002 , we quantified damage by all the observable ( aboveground ) pathogen and herbivore on six of the most common plant specie ( Artemisia tridentata , Helianthella quinquenervis , Erigeron speciosus , Potentilla gracilis , Potentilla hippiana , and Lathyrus leucanthus ) . We found that plant in the earlier melting plot generally had the most damage and were attacked by a larger number of specie , which is consistent with prediction . However , although the overall trend wa an increase in damage with warmer temperature and earlier snowmelt , some pathogen and herbivore performed better in cooler or later melting plot . The idiosyncratic response of each specie to environmental condition suggests that there are likely to be change in community composition a the planet warms .

aVGenetic algorithm is applied to find the optimum gas mixture ratio a gas insulating medium substituting pure SF6 . Genetic Algorithm is very useful to find the optimum solution from vast searching possibility . Testing each gas mixture by experiment requires a long time . The present method is very efficient to preselect the . candidate of gas mixture before more thorough but time-consuming investigation via experiment is carried out . The gas mixture ratio is coded a a series of bit simulating a genetic sequence of a life form . Two-term Boltzmann equation is used to calculate the effective ionization coefficient of each gas mixture that is used to evaluate the degree of adaptation of each individual representing one set of mixture ratio . Two type of degree of adaptation are used to evaluate each individual , the effective ionization coefficient at the critical ratio of the electric field to the gas density of SF6 of 359.3 x 10 ( 21 ) Vm ( 2 ) , and the global warming potential . Based on the degree of adaptation , better individual can be selected a parent of the next generation , leaving their gene to future generation . After some generation , the group of individual converges into the optimum with the best degree of adaptation .

aVA series of sensitivity study were performed with a spectral radiative transfer model using aerosol data from the Global Aerosol Data Set ( GADS , data available at http : //www.meteo.physik.uni-muenchen.de/strahlung/aerosol/aerosol.htm ) in order to investigate and quantify the relative role of key climatic parameter on clear-sky ultraviolet-visible direct aerosol radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere ( TOA ) , within the atmosphere and at the Earth 's surface . The model result show that relative humidity and aerosol single-scattering albedo are the most important climatic parameter that determine aerosol forcing at the TOA and at the Earth 's surface and atmosphere , respectively . Relative humidity exerts a non-linear positive radiative effect , i.e . increasing humidity amplifies the magnitude of the forcing in the atmosphere and at the surface . Our model sensitivity study show that increasing relative humidity by 10 % , in relative term , increase the aerosol forcing by factor of 1.42 at the TOA , 1.02 in the atmosphere and 1.17 at the surface . An increase in aerosol single-scattering albedo by 10 % , in relative term , increased the aerosol forcing at the TOA by 1.29 , while it decreased the forcing in the atmosphere and at the surface by factor of 0.2 and 0.69 , respectively . Our result show that an increase in relative humidity enhances the planetary cooling effect of aerosol ( increased reflection of solar radiation to space ) over ocean and low-albedo land area , whilst over polar region and highly reflecting land surface the warming effect of aerosol change to a cooling effect . Thus , global warming and an associated increase in relative humidity would lead to enhanced aerosol cooling worldwide . The sensitivity result also demonstrate that an increase in surface albedo due to , for example , a reduction in land vegetation cover , would lead to enhanced atmospheric warming by aerosol leading to a reduction in cloud formation and enhancement of the desertification process . On the contrary , a decrease in surface albedo over polar region due to , for example , ice-melting associated with global warming , would reduce the planetary warming effect of aerosol over polar area . Aerosol forcing is found to be quite sensitive to cloud cover , a well a to aerosol optical thickness and the asymmetry parameter , and to the wavelength dependence of the aerosol optical property .

Local climate is defined by the combination of an observation-based climatology and perturbation pattern derived from a 4 x CO ( 2 ) warming simulation , which are linearly scaled to global mean temperature deviation , DeltaT ( glob ) . Global carbon storage remains close to it optimum for DeltaT ( glob ) in the range of +/-3degreesC in simulation with constant atmospheric CO ( 2 ) . The magnitude of the carbon loss to the atmosphere per unit change in global average surface temperature show a pronounced nonlinear threshold behavior . About twice a much carbon is lost per degree warming for DeltaT ( glob ) above 3degreesC than for present climate . Tropical , temperate , and boreal tree spread poleward with global warming . Vegetation dynamic govern the distribution of soil carbon storage and turnover in the climate space . For cold climate condition , the global average decomposition rate of litter and soil decrease with warming , despite local increase in turnover rate . This result is not compatible with the assumption , commonly made in global box model , that soil turnover increase exponentially with global average surface temperature , over a wide temperature range .

aVFertilized rice paddy soil emit methane while flooded , emit nitrous oxide during flooding and draining transition , and can be a source or sink of carbon dioxide . Changing water management of rice paddy can affect net emission of all three of these greenhouse gas . We used denitrification-decomposition ( DNDC ) , a process-based biogeochemistry model , to evaluate the annual emission of CH ( 4 ) , N ( 2 ) O , and CO ( 2 ) for continuously flooded , single- , double- , and triple-cropped rice ( three baseline scenario ) , and in further simulation , the change in emission with changing water management to midseason draining of the paddy , and to alternating crop of midseason drained rice and upland crop ( two alternative for each baseline scenario ) . We used a set of first-order atmospheric model to track the atmospheric burden of each gas over 500 year . We evaluated the dynamic of the radiative forcing due to the change in emission of CH ( 4 ) , N ( 2 ) O , and CO ( 2 ) ( alternative minus baseline ) , and compared these with standard calculation of CO ( 2 ) -equivalent emission using global warming potential ( GWPs ) . All alternative scenario had lower CH ( 4 ) emission and higher N ( 2 ) O emission than their corresponding baseline case , and all but one sequestered carbon in the soil more slowly . Because of difference in emission , in radiative forcing per molecule , and in atmospheric time constant ( lifetime ) , the relative radiative impact of CH ( 4 ) , N ( 2 ) O , and CO ( 2 ) varied over the 500-year simulation . In three of the six case , the initial change in radiative forcing wa dominated by reduced CH ( 4 ) emission ( i.e . a cooling for the first few decade ) ; in five of the six case , the long-term radiative forcing wa dominated by increased N ( 2 ) O emission ( i.e . a warming over several century ) . The overall complexity of the radiative forcing response to changing water management could not easily be captured with conventional GWP calculation .

aVThe carbon sink capacity of the world 's agricultural and degraded soil is 50 to 66 % of the historic carbon loss of 42 to 78 gigatons of carbon . The rate of soil organic carbon sequestration with adoption of recommended technology depends on soil texture and structure , rainfall , temperature , farming system , and soil management . Strategies to increase the soil carbon pool include soil restoration and woodland regeneration , no-till farming , cover crop , nutrient management , manuring and sludge application , improved grazing , water conservation and harvesting , efficient irrigation , agroforestry practice , and growing energy crop on spare land . An increase of 1 ton of soil carbon pool of degraded cropland soil may increase crop yield by 20 to 40 kilogram per hectare ( kg/ha ) for wheat , 10 to 20 kg/ha for maize , and 0.5 to 1 kg/ha for cowpea . As well a enhancing food security , carbon sequestration ha the potential to offset fossil-fuel emission by 0.4 to 1.2 gigatons of carbon per year , or 5 to 15 % of the global fossil-fuel emission .

aVThe magnitude of the Sun 's influence on climate ha been a subject of intense debate . Estimates of this magnitude are generally based on assumption regarding the forcing due to solar irradiance variation entering climate modelling . Given the complexity of the climate system , however , such modelling is perforce based on simplifying assumption , which leaf it open to criticism . We take a complementary approach . We assume that the Sun ha been responsible for climate change prior to 1970 and that their interrelation remained unchanged afterwards . Then , employing reconstruction and measured record of relevant solar quantity a well a of the cosmic-ray flux , we estimate statistically which fraction of the dramatic temperature rise after that date could be due to the influence of the Sun . We show that at least in the most recent past ( since about 1970 ) the solar influence on climate can not have been significant . ( C ) 2004 COSPAR . Published by Elsevier Lid . All right reserved .

aVSpatial and temporal dynamic of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope signature of the bottom-dwelling caridean shrimp Nauticaris marionis were measured during April and May between 1984 and 2000 in the vicinity of Marion Island ( the Prince Edward Islands , Southern Ocean ) . There wa one trophic-level enrichment in bulk delta ( 15 ) N and delta ( 13 ) C signature between small ( 20 mm ) specimen of N. marionis , suggesting distinct trophic differentiation among major shrimp size group . Both delta ( 15 ) N and delta ( 13 ) C value of N. marionis increased with the depth , reflecting change in their diet . There were no clear temporal trend in bulk delta ( 15 ) N signature of N. marionis . However , compound-specific delta ( 15 ) N measurement of amino acid indicated that N. marionis from the inter-island realm occupied the trophic level of second order carnivore , while similarly sized shrimp in the near-shore realm were at the trophic level of first order carnivore . Compound-specific measurement also identified a change in the source of inorganic nitrogen at the base of the food web between the inter-island and near-shore realm . In contrast to the bulk delta ( 15 ) N value , a significant shift in bulk delta ( 13 ) C value of N. marionis wa observed between 1984 and more recent year . This temporal change appears to be linked to change in the overall productivity of the Prince Edward Island inter-island system , which could be linked to global climate change .

aVEnvironmental scientist from federal agency , such a the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) , and academia have long suspected that increasing anthropogenic input of various trace gas into the atmosphere can cause change in the earth 's climate and protective ozone layer . Nitrous oxide and methane , cited in the Kyoto Protocol , a well a trichlorofluoromethane ( CFC-11 ) and dichlorodifluoromethane ( CFC-12 ) , cited in the Montreal Protocol , are all greenhouse gas and are implicated in the destruction of the stratospheric ozone layer . The lack of national standard prompted research to determine the feasibility of preparing accurate and stable standard containing these four compound . Development of these standard would support the measurement of these specie by those in the atmospheric research community not having their own source of standard . A suite of eight primary gas standard containing methane , nitrous oxide , CFC-11 , and CFC-12 in a balance of air were prepared gravimetrically to bracket the ambient atmospheric concentration . The combined uncertainty ( u ( c ) ) were calculated from error propagation analysis that included the weighing data from the gravimetric preparation and other source of error such a the purity analysis of the compound and air matrix . The expanded uncertainty ( U ) for the gravimetric standard were < 0.5 % a calculated from the equation U = ku ( c ) , where the coverage factor k is equal to 2 for a 95 % confidence interval . Analyses of the suite of standard by gas chromatography with flame-ionization and electron capture detection resulted in average absolute residual of < 0.25 % from regression model . The NIST suite of eight gravimetric standard wa used to determine the concentration in two standard from NOAA . Those analysis resulted in bias across the two laboratory of le than or equal to2.1 % .

aVNowadays , energetic need are mainly covered by fossil energy leading to pollutant emission mostly responsible for global warming . Among the different possible solution for the greenhouse effect reduction , hydrogen ha been proposed for energy transportation . Indeed , H-2 can be seen a a clean and efficient energy carrier . However , beside the difficulty related to hydrogen production , efficient high capacity storage is still to be developed . Hydrogen can be stored a a compressed gas , in liquefied tank or absorbed in solid . Many metal and alloy are able to store large amount of hydrogen . This latter solution is of interest in term of safety , global yield and long time storage . However , to be suitable for application , such compound must present high capacity , good reversibility , fast reactivity and sustainability . In this paper , we will review on the structural and thermodynamic property of metallic hydride . Their solid-gas hydrogenation behaviour and the related absorption-desorption isotherm curve are examined a a useful criterion for the selection of suitable material for application . The storage performance obtained with these alloy are reported and some solution to common problem such a corrosion , passivation , decrepitation , poor kinetic and short cycle life are discussed .

aVIn a recent series of tutorial paper , Rust [ 7,8,9,10 ] modelled measured time series for global temperature and fossil fuel CO2 emission with related combination of polynomial , exponential , and sinusoid , using least square fit that can be done by student well grounded in practical statistic . The analysis suggested that temperature cycle around a monotonically increasing , accelerating baseline with a period of approximate to65 year and that the exponential growth rate Of CO2 emission varies inversely with this cycle . The Gaia hypothesis [ 5 ] suggests that the biosphere adjusts atmospheric greenhouse gas to maintain an optimal temperature for life . The previous analysis is here extended with a series of fitting exercise designed to demonstrate that the above described inverse relation represents a Gaian feedback .

aVThe summer of 2003 wa extremely hot in Western Europe and in the Alps . Here I analyse the role of elevation in the temperature measured in 2003 , and I compare daytime and nighttime value . Records from 16 station at varying elevation show that , during the night , there wa a significant correlation between heat and altitude . Hot nighttime temperature were particularly frequent at low elevation . The frequency of unusually hot daytime high wa not correlated with altitude , but with the average degree of insolation of the site . Compared to long-term averaged value ( 1961-1990 ) the temperature were hottest in the normally sunniest site . The unusual nature of the 2003 heat wave wa not the absolute daily extreme value , but the lack of cool temperature and the large number of very warm day . Averaged over all climate station , half of the day in summer were hotter than the 90th percentile ( climate normal 1961-1990 ) , with up to 72 % at some station .

aVEpiphytes are one of the most ubiquitous element of tropical forest canopy , including seasonally dry tropical forest . Given the temporal variation in weather condition in the latter , epiphyte population may be subject to wide temporal variation in seedling recruitment , reproductive success , vegetative propagation and mortality rate . In this study , we use a 3-y demographic data set for Tillandsia brachycaulos to project it long-term population dynamic through the use of average and periodic matrix , a well a stochastic simulation . The result show that demographic behaviour varied over the 3 year of study , apparently in relation to rainfall . The first 2 year yielded a low lambda value ( 0.79 and 0.80 - although only the former wa significantly lower than unity ) , while the third year resulted in a lambda = 1.08 ( not significantly different from 1.0 ) . When incorporating this demographic variation in an average matrix , a periodic matrix and stochastic simulation , the resulting overall lambda wa below unity in all three case . The projection of the stochastic simulation suggest that the population would be able to persist in the long run only if the frequency of 'good ' year ( defined here a those with an August rainfall above 200 mm ) wa above 0.6 , which appears unlikely given that global warming might result in a lower frequency of rainy year in tropical dry forest .

aVIn the temperate North Atlantic Ocean the ecological change in coastal water associated with a warming period in the 1930s were compared with the past couple of decade when the North Atlantic Oscillation wa also positive . Long-term monitoring data set from Rhode Island and nearby coastal water were used to identify trend in the recent warming period . During both event winter water temperature warmed above a mean value of 2.9degreesC from 1degreesC to 3degreesC . There wa no apparent trend in the annual salinity cycle correlated with the increased temperature . During both period boreal specie declined , southern specie increased , and widespread decline in eelgrass occurred . Estuaries on the western Atlantic Ocean during the recent warming period had phytoplankton biomass during the winter-spring bloom decrease , zooplankton number increase , and nutrient remain elevated due to enhanced zooplankton grazing . Zooptankton number decreased in summer due to enhanced ctenophore predation . In these water the loss of boreal demersal fish ha been compensated by air increase in demersal decapod . The very large ecological change caused by small increase in seasonal temperature provide an insight to the large alteration that may be associated with global warming .

aVThe Earth Simulator Research Project started in March 2002 with the primary objective of producing reliable prediction data for global climate change . Within a couple of month after the start of operation , the Earth Simulator achieved an amazing performance of 35.86 Teraflops ( about 90 % of the peak performance of 40.96 Teraflops ) in the Linpack benchmark test and , more surprisingly , 26.58 Teraflops for a typical application program of global atmospheric circulation model ( called AFES ) with a horizontal resolution of 10km . These fact ensure u that the real contribution of the Earth Simulator be far greater than originally expected . Undoubtedly , the Earth Simulator would work to make a paradigm shift in science , industry , and human thinking , a well a finding the best human 's wisdom to keep a sustainable symbiotic relationship with nature .

aVEnvironmental cue control or synchronize the reproductive cycle of many marine invertebrate . Of these environmental cue , photoperiod and temperature have been shown to moderate reproduction either individually or in combination . In addition , they may act directly or , in the case of photoperiod , set circannual clock mechanism . These environmental cue may affect a number of reproductive parameter , including sex determination , gametogenesis and spawning . Gonadotrophic and spawning hormone appear to act a the transducer between the environment and the gamete , and limited evidence indicates that temperature and photoperiod can alter level of these . Such process occur in a range of estuarine invertebrate that constitute important component of the diet of overwintering bird . Global warming is likely to uncouple and alter the phase relationship between temperature and photoperiod and this is likely to have significant consequence for animal that develop gamete during the winter and spawn in the spring in temperate northern latitude . Species that cue reproduction to photoperiod are likely to be particularly vulnerable . Although this is unlikely to lead to extinction , it may cause local extirpation . However , this will depend on speed of adaptation to changing climate in relation to speed of climate change and the degree of mixing between population across the range of the specie . More likely will be significant impact on fecundity , spawning success and recruitment , and this may have significant implication for overwintering bird of national and international importance , and , ultimately , on the conservation status of estuary such a the Humber in the UK .

aVAim To model long-term trend in plant specie distribution in response to predicted change in global climate . Location Amazonia . Methods The impact of expected global climate change on the potential and realized distribution of a representative sample of 69 individual Angiosperm specie in Amazonia were simulated from 1990 to 2095 . The climate trend followed the HADCM2GSa1 scenario , which assumes an annual 1 % increase of atmospheric CO2 content with effect mitigated by sulphate forcing . Potential distribution of specie in one-degree grid cell were modelled using a suitability index and rectilinear envelope based on bioclimate variable . Realized distribution were additionally limited by spatial contiguity with , and proximity to , known record site . A size-structured population model wa simulated for each cell in the realized distribution to allow for lag in response to climate change , but dispersal wa not included . Results In the resulting simulation , 43 % of all specie became non-viable by 2095 because their potential distribution had changed drastically , but there wa little change in the realized distribution of most specie , owing to delay in population response . Widely distributed specie with high tolerance to environmental variation exhibited the least response to climate change , and specie with narrow range and short generation time the greatest . Climate changed most in north-east Amazonia while the best remaining condition for lowland moist forest specie were in western Amazonia . Main conclusion To maintain the greatest resilience of Amazonian biodiversity to climate change a modelled by HADCM2GSa1 , highest priority should be given to strengthening and extending protected area in western Amazonia that encompass lowland and montane forest .

aVThe Shiyang River basin is a typical interior river basin that face water shortage and environmental deterioration in the and northwest of China . Due to it arid climate , limited water resource and some inappropriate water-related human activity , the area ha developed serious loss of vegetation , and gradual soil salinization and desertification , which have greatly impeded the sustainable development of agriculture and life in this region . In this paper , the impact of human activity on the water-soil environment in Shiyang River basin are analysed in term of precipitation , runoff in branch of the river , inflow into lower reach , water conveyance efficiency of the canal system and irrigation water use efficiency in the field , replenishment and exploitation of groundwater resource , soil salinization , vegetation cover and the speed of desertification . The result show that human activity and global climate change have no significant influence on the precipitation , but the total annual runoff in eight branch river showed a significant decrease over the year . The proportion of water use in the upper and middle reach compared to the lower reach wa increased from 1:0.57 in the 1960s , to 1:0.27 in the 1970s and 1:0.09 in the 1990s . A reduction of about 74 % in the river inflow to the lower reach and a 15-m drop in the groundwater table have occurred during the last four decade . Strategies for improving the water-soil environment of the basin , such a the protection of the water resource of the Qilian Mountains , sustainable use of water resource , maintenance of the balance between land and water resource , development of water-saving agriculture , diverting of water from other river and control of soil desertification , are proposed . The objective of this paper is to provide guideline for reconstruction of the sustainable water management and development of agriculture in this region .

aVThe impact of global warming on the annual North Atlantic Oscillation ( NAO ) is investigated with a global warming scenario simulation of the ECHAM4/OPYC3 coupled general circulation model . It is shown that the annual meridional pressure gradient over the North Atlantic is significantly strengthened , and the two center of action of the NAO , the Icelandic low and the Azores high , are intensified and shifted northeastward by 10degrees to 20degrees in latitude and 30degrees to 40degrees in longitude in the global warming scenario . The shift of the center of action lead to a failure in capturing the NAO change with the traditional definition of the NAO index . A modified index is introduced that allows for this shift , and exhibit a tendency toward the positive phase and an enhancement of it intensity . The intensification of Icelandic low is tied up with zonal mean state change , and the strengthened Azores high is related to the stationary wave change . The shift of the center of action of the NAO is associated with the stationary wave change .

aVCarbonyl fluoride ( COF2 ) ha been investigated a an alternative gas for plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition ( PECVD ) chamber cleaning in order to reduce greenhouse gas emitted from the cleaning process in semiconductor manufacturing . The cleaning performance of COF2 and the environmental impact of it exhaust gas were evaluated using an experimental plasma tool . The result indicated that the cleaning performance of COF2 wa equivalent to that of conventional C2F6 . Furthermore , it wa confirmed that the use of COF2 would enable the reduction of global warming emission by over 95 % relative to the use of C2F6 , and thus COF2 is considered to be a promising alternative cleaning gas .

aVThe observed climate exhibit noticeable fluctuation on a range of temporal and spatial scale . Major fluctuation are often attributed to 'external ' influence , such a volcanic eruption or solar perturbation , which obscure climatic fluctuation associated with natural climatic variability generated by internal process within the climatic system . Although it is difficult to isolate the role of natural climatic variability within the observed climatic system , coupled global climatic model permit such a discrimination to be made in appropriately designed simulation . Thus , the CSIRO coupled global climatic model ha been used to determined some basic characteristic of annually averaged global mean climate within a multi-millennial climatic simulation . Some examination of observed climate is also presented . A stationary climatic state wa simulated for period of up to 10000 year using the CSIRO model , with equilibrium usually being maintained to within 1-2 % for all climatic variable investigated . The mean by which such stationarity is maintained is analysed and the necessity for rapid negative feedback mechanism is emphasized . The role of topographically induced climatic feature is also discussed . Finally , the implication of the present , presumably greenhouse-related , global warming are considered in the context of the present result . Copyright ( C ) 2004 Royal Meteorological Society .

aVAs environmental awareness increase , industry and business have responded by providing 'greener '' product and using ''greener '' process . Many company have found it advantageous to explore way of moving beyond compliance , using pollution prevention strategy and environmental management system , to improve their environmental performance . One such way is life-cycle assessment ( LCA ) . This concept considers the entire life cycle of a product , process , or an activity . Evaluating environmental impact holistically from raw material acquisition , through manufacture , use , and disposal using a life-cycle perspective is gradually being viewed by environmental manager and decision maker a an important element in achieving environmental sustainability . The use of a holistic , life cycle approach can help industry and government avoid the unintended trading of one environmental problem for another . this paper address ongoing research in LCA methodology in the US EPA 's National Risk Management Research Laboratory . Two key area of this research include life-cycle inventory ( LCI ) data availability and life-cycle impact assessment ( LCIA ) modeling . To address the issue of data availability , EPA developed a website entitled LCAccess . Although LCAccess doe not itself contain data , it is a searchable global directory to potential data source . LCAccess also serf a a central source for LCA information . In addition , EPA developed TRACI ( the Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and other environmental Impacts ) , which allows the characterization of ozone depletion , global warming , acidification , eutrophication , tropospheric ozone ( smog ) formation , ecotoxicity , buman Particulate effect , human health , fossil fuel depletion , and land use effect . TRACI can be used with life-cycle inventory to further analyze and understand the data . ( C ) 2004 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog .

aV[ 1 ] Blooms of the coccolithophorid Emiliana huxleyi may be sensitive to climate change . A comparison of global Coastal Zone Color Scanner ( CZCS , 1978-1986 ) and Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor ( SeaWiFS , 1997 present ) imagery appears to show them advancing into some sub-Arctic sea . To determine when coccolithophore bloom appeared in the Barents Sea this paper make use of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer ( AVHRR ) visible channel data which bridge the gap between the CZCS and SeaWiFS mission ( 1981 - present ) . Analysis of over 3700 AVHRR image ha shown coccolithophore bloom to be unambiguously present between 1989 - 1992 but probably absent in other pre-SeaWiFS year . This paper show a correlation between positive temperature - negative salinity anomaly in the Barents Sea and bloom occurrence . If global warming continues to trigger increased warmth and freshwater runoff in the region then there may be an increased frequency of coccolithophore bloom within the Barents Sea .

aVA traditional approach used to evaluate clean-up technology , in which only plant discharge are considered , is contrasted with a sustainability assessment . The sustainability of any technology can be assessed from three complementary point of view : economic , environmental and social . As such , this paper present a comprehensive scheme that can be applied to any process , product or technology . In addition , the use of chemical engineering tool such a process design , process modelling and simulation represent a baseline for the sustainability assessment of technology , a presented in a case study . The optimal granular activated carbon adsorption process design is used a a model system to demonstrate the advantage of sustainability approach over traditional approach . A mathematical model that describes the performance of the process at various design option wa developed . This model includes cost equation that were used to estimate the total cost of each alternative under different plant design and two waste scenario ( a benzene and a 1,2-dichloroethane discharge ) . Life Cycle Assessment tool were applied to generate an inventory of emission and the impact assessment measured a Photochemical Ozone Creation ( POC ) and Global Warming Potential ( GWP ) . The model examined trade-off between pollutant discharged into the atmosphere and pollution associated with the adoption and operation of the technology . One of the main result from the technology assessment is that the environmental impact , measured in term of GWP proved to be higher for the technology operation than for the untreated waste stream themselves , and therefore suggested that the stream should not be treated . However , the social impact evaluation ( measured a risk assessment ) conducted a part of this work proved that it wa morally and legally mandatory to treat them due to the adverse effect on human health that they may represent . As such , a triple bottom line sustainability assessment wa demonstrated to be one of the most important framework for decision making . The evaluation scheme presented in this work can also be applied to other area such a the identification of the most sustainable process design and different green chemistry route alternative .

aVGridded temperature data are necessary to run ecological model at regional scale for climate impact study and have been generated by spatially interpolating measured value at synoptic station . Because there are few synoptic station with long-term record in rural area in Korea , data from urban station have been used for this purpose . Due to the overlapping of the rapid urbanization-industrialization period with the global warming era in Korea , climate data from these urbanized area might be contaminated with urban heat island effect . This study wa conducted to differentiate urbanization and regional climate change effect on apparent temperature change . Monthly average of daily minimum , maximum , and mean temperature at 14 synoptic station were prepared for 1951-1980 ( past normal ) and 1971-2000 ( current normal ) period , respectively . Differences in two temperature normal were regressed to the logarithm of the population increase at 14 corresponding city from 1966 to 1985 . The regression equation were used to determine potential effect of urbanization and to extract the net contribution of regional climate change to the apparent temperature change . According to the model calculation , urbanization effect wa common in all month except April . Up to 0.5. warming of nighttime temperature wa induced by urbanization in the current normal period compared with the past normal period . There wa little effect of regional climate change on local warming in the warm season ( May through November ) . The cool season wa warmed mainly by regionally increased daytime temperature . The result could be used to remove urbanization effect embedded in raw data , helping restore unbiased rural temperature trend in South Korea .

aVThe extreme flood of Lake Constance in 1999 focused attention on the variability of annual lake level . The year 1999 not only brought one of the highest flood of the last 180 year but also one of the earliest in the season . The 1999 extreme event wa caused by heavy rainfall in the alpine and pre-alpine region . The influence of precipitation in the two distinct regional catchment on lake level variation can be quantified by correlation analysis . The long-term variation in lake level and precipitation show similar pattern . This is seen through the use of spectral analysis , which give similar band of spectral density for precipitation and lake level time series . It can be concluded from the comparison of these result with the analysis of climate change pattern in northern Europe , i.e . the index of the North Atlantic Oscillation , that the regional effect on lake level variation are more pronounced than those of global climate change .

aVThe state of Ceara , located in semiarid northeastern Brazil , suffers under irregularly recurring drought that go along with water scarcity . Structural policy to control and reduce water scarcity , a water supply and demand management , should be seen a long-term planning , and thus must consider climate change and regional development . To this end , the present research proposes a model-based global change scenario . Water stress is assessed for 184 municipality in Ceara between 2001 and 2025 . For this purpose , four global change scenario are developed , considering both global climate change and the effect of development policy . Climatic , hydrological , and water use model are applied and a proposed index computed for identification of long-term water stress . Application of the methodology in the focus area show that , if no effective intervention measure are taken , up to almost 60 percent of the municipality of the state may suffer under long-term water scarcity by 2025 . On average , municipality in the state of Ceara have a water shortage probability for the next 25 year ranging from 9 percent to 20 percent annually , depending on the scenario . The 10 percent most stressed municipality have a probability of over 80 percent annually of facing water scarcity in the scenario period ( 25 year ) . Results also show that a decentralized development policy can compensate for the possible severe effect of climatic trend on future water availability over the scenario period .

aVThe movement of water play an important role in a number of physiological ( e.g. , metabolic rate , nutrient uptake ) and ecological ( e.g. , foraging , fertilization ) process for coral reef organism . In the back reef of Discovery Bay , Jamaica , daytime mean flow speed were on average , 61 % greater than at night during a given 24 hr period . Wind speed wa a significant predictor of flow speed in these shallow water environment , with the variation in wind speed able to explain 30 % of the variation in flow speed . Porter 's ( 1985 ) yearlong wind speed record in Discovery Bay indicated that the time of maximum daily wind speed occurred during daylight hour for 93 % of the year . Activity of the fireworm , Hermodice carunculata ( Pallas , 1766 ) , represented by total abundance in six , 1 x 30 m transects wa negatively correlated with flow speed . Atmospheric and oceanographic condition enhancing wind-dependent water flow in back reef environment include prevalent tradewinds and negligible tidal current , which suggests that the diel variation in flow speed documented for Discovery Bay may be a common phenomenon in similar environment . Such predictable environmental variability may be an important selective agent shaping the evolution of diel rhythm of reef invertebrate and algae . Therefore , recent atmospheric and climatological shift ( e.g. , frequency of El Nino event , global climate change ) may exert additional selective pressure on the organism found in these environment .

aVOf 14 specie of marmot ( genus Marmota , Family Sciuridae ) , only 2 , the woodchuck ( M. monax ) and yellow-bellied man-not ( M. flaviventris ) , have not been reported to be obligate social hibernators . There is one published report of yellow-bellied man-not juvenile hibernating together at a subalpine site , and social hibernation wa reported at a single high-alpine site . Solitary hibernation is expected in woodchuck because they do not share burrow during summer , but is unexpected in yellow-bellied marmot , a harem-polygynous specie where female may share burrow and have extensive home-range overlap with female kin during summer . We documented emergence pattern in 13 matrilines to determine whether adult marmot hibernate socially . We found that adult male hibernated with 1 or more adult female , and mother hibernated with their offspring . Therefore , we conclude that yellow-bellied marmot hibernate socially . There is , however , no evidence that suggests that yellow-bellied marmot receive social thermoregulatory benefit from social hibernation . Documenting social hibernation required u to quantify pattern of emergence from hibernation . Throughout our subalpine site , emergence appears to be getting earlier ; a result consistent with a previous report based on 1 colony site and which suggests the effect of global climate change are affecting hibernation pattern .

aVPaleoclimate modeling ha become an important tool to detect the future climate of the global warming that is difficult to be validated . The paleoclimate modeling ha to be evaluated by regionally geological data in order to determine if it is able to reproduce a reality of climate state . Geological evidence show that there wa a warm-wet interstadial at 35000 +/- 3000 a BP in China , which provides an important climate period to be historical analogue for the future climate change induced by greenhouse gas emission . Integrated geological record of later phase of the MSI3 from China also provide basement for evaluation of 35 ka BP climate modeling . This paper report the paleoclimate experiment applied by various force , and validates the output by geological data , consequently improving the boundary condition in the experiment and making the paleoclimates more approach the reality . The simulation show an increased temperature in the mid-low latitude and an extended rain-belt northward in East Asia , while a decreased temperature in high latitude and a strong exchange of the N-S atmospheric circulation . As there is only ca . 10-15 ka from 35 ka BP to the LGM ( 21 ka BP ) during which climate rapidly changed from a warm-wet interstadial to a typical ice age , this simulation provides scientific basis to recognize the criterion of global warming and trend of natural climate development .

aVThe Japanese government is planning to introduce DME a a substituted energy for oil and LNG . Introduction of DME could contribute greatly to both the prevention of global warming and the formation of resource-recycling society . In these circumstance , a safety assessment of DME is very important when DME is used on a large scale . There is a possibility that prolonged exposure in air induces autoxidation to produce explosive organic peroxide during transportation and storage of DME . Therefore , the reactivity of DME with oxygen and the mechanism of the autoxidation were investigated . Accelerating Rate Calorimetry ( ARC ) wa used to evaluate the thermal stability of DME and DIPE , a known peroxide producer , under adiabatic and various atmospheric condition . In ARC study of DME under oxygen , exothermic decomposition were detected although it self-heating rate wa low in comparison with DIPE . Oven storage test were carried out and iodimetry wa used to measure the concentration of peroxide produced from DME in comparison with DIPE and DEE . However . no product could be found for DME either by GC/MS or by iodimetry , while some evidence of autoxidation of both DEE and DIPE were obtained from these experiment . ( c ) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

aVWe present a new glacial chronology for the last glacial interglacial transition , c. 20 to 10 ka , from the Cobb Valley , NW Nelson , New Zealand , based on a suite of Be-10 and Al-26 cosmogenic exposure age . This chronology describes one of the most comprehensive deglaciation sequence from a late Quaternary valley system in the Southern Hemisphere . We chronicle the decay from the last ( local ) glacial maximum a follows : onset of the last deglaciation that commenced no earlier than 18-19 ka , followed by numerous short-term still-stands and/or minor re-advances over the ensuing 3-4 kyr , and complete evacuation of ice by 14 ka . We find no evidence to indicate a late glacial re-advance commensurate with the Northern Hemisphere Younger Dryas chronozone . The absence of a major glacial re-advance in this valley during the latter stage of the last glacial interglacial transition ( LGIT ) precludes a thermal decline in excess of about 3 degree C and suggests no decline . The absence of late LGIT re-advances in the mountain of North-West Nelson , while deglacial readvances occurred in the main range of the Southern Alps can be best explained if westerly wind forcing rather than large-scale thermal decline is the primary control on glacier fluctuation , at least during the deglaciation . These finding challenge model of global climate change predicated on synchrony of millennial-scale glacial transition due to thermal change between Northern and Southern Hemispheres .

aV[ 1 ] The initiation of northern hemisphere ice sheet in the last 800 kyr appears to be closely controlled by minimum in summer insolation forcing at 65 & DEG ; N. Beginning from an initial typical interglacial pCO ( 2 ) of 280 ppm , the CLIMBER-2 model initiate an ice sheet in the Northern Hemisphere when insolation drop 0.7 & sigma ; ( standard deviation ) or 15 W/m ( 2 ) below the mean . This same value is required to explain the history of climate using an orbitally driven conceptual model based on insolation and ice volume threshold ( Paillard , 1998 ) . When the initial baseline pCO ( 2 ) is raised in CLIMBER-2 , a deeper minimum in summertime insolation is required to nucleate an ice sheet . Carbon cycle model indicate that & SIM ; 25 % of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion will remain in the atmosphere for thousand of year , and & SIM ; 7 % will remain beyond one hundred thousand year ( Archer , 2005 ) . We predict that a carbon release from fossil fuel or methane hydrate deposit of 5000 Gton C could prevent glaciation for the next 500,000 year , until after not one but two 400 kyr cycle eccentricity minimum . The duration and intensity of the projected interglacial period are longer than have been seen in the last 2.6 million year .

aVThe effect of increased atmospheric CO2 on the frequency of extreme hydrologic event in the Western United States ( WUS ) for the 10-yr period of 2040-2049 are examined using dynamically downscaled regional climate change signal . For assessing the change in the occurrence of hydrologic extreme , downscaled climate change signal in daily precipitation and runoff that are likely to indicate the occurrence of extreme event are examined . Downscaled climate change signal in the selected indicator suggest that the global warming induced by increased CO2 is likely to increase extreme hydrologic event in the WUS . The indicator for heavy precipitation event show largest increase in the mountainous region of the northern California Coastal Range and the Sierra Nevada . Increased cold season precipitation and increased rainfall-portion of precipitation at the expense of snowfall in the projected warmer climate result in large increase in high runoff event in the Sierra Nevada river basin that are already prone to cold season flooding in today 's climate . The projected change in the hydrologic characteristic in the WUS are mainly associated with higher freezing level in the warmer climate and increase in the cold season water vapor influx from the Pacific Ocean .

aVThe mass extinction at the Cretaceous-Tertiary ( K/T ) boundary ca . 65 million year ago caused a major change in the nature and abundance of global life in Earth history . We present the first vertical higb-resolution record of molecular distribution of n-fatty acid across the K/T boundary at Caravaca ( Spain ) . The result reveal that the first basal thin horizon ( 0 to +0.5 cm ; 0 = K/T boundary ) of the K/T boundary-clay layer showed a much a a similar to 35-fold increase in concentration of terrestrial long-chain n-fatty acid ( > = C-20 ) , representative of an eight-fold increase in mass accumulation rate , compared with the subjacent Cretaceous layer . Thereafter concentration rapidly declined back to almost pre-boundary value within +3 cm above the K/T boundary . The abrupt increase in supply of terrestrial organic matter into the marine environment at the K/T boundary could have been caused by an enhanced riverine flux , probably due to heavy rain associated with global warming , combined with enhanced fragment of terrestrial higher-plants withered by acid rain and/or by temporal darkness and cooling .

aVWe performed an irrigation experiment to study the impact of summer drought on Pinus sylvestris establishment at it southernmost distribution limit . Watering wa done during the first growing season simulating mesic summer condition , and we monitored the consequence for survival and growth during the first growing season and the delayed consequence on the second growing season . In addition , we considered the heterogeneity created by the microhabitats , where seed are found after dispersal ( bare soil , under shrub , and under adult pine ) . Summer drought wa the main mortality factor in all the microhabitats . Watering increased emergence and doubled seedling survival compared to non-watered control site . Differences were even higher when the cumulative effect on emergence and survival wa considered , with an overall recruitment of 22.4 % in watered plot vs. 7.9 % in control . Irrigation increased growth in bare soil and under shrub , but had scant effect on growth under pine , suggesting that radiation wa the limiting factor in this microhabitat . The positive effect of irrigation on growth parameter persisted during the second growing season despite water wa not added the second year , showing delayed consequence of drought on seedling performance . Summer drought thus limit Pinus sylvestris establishment in these southernmost forest by reducing both recruitment and growth . This might lead to the development of a remnant dynamic in these relict population under the current regional increase in dryness and rainfall variability associated with global warming .

aVRecently , there ha been increasing evidence of specie ' range shift due to change in climate . Whereas most of these shift relate ground truth biogeographic data to a general warming trend in regional or global climate data , we here present a reanalysis of both biogeographic and bioclimatic data of equal spatio-temporal resolution , covering a time span of more than 50 year . Our result reveal a coherent and synchronous shift in both specie ' distribution and climate . They show not only a shift in the northern margin of a specie , which is in concert with gradually increasing winter temperature in the area , they also confirm the simulated specie ' distribution change expected from a bioclimatic model under the recent , relatively moderate climate change .

aVThe Lunawa Estuary ha been selected a a model for studying the long-term diagnoss of tropical estuarine pollution and it impact on ecosystem . Surface and short-core sediment from the Lunawa Estuary were collected , and analyzed for total organic carbon ( TOC ) , nitrogen , sulfur and hydrocarbon content , hydrogen index and other related sediment property . Water quality and surface sediment data indicate that the Lunawa Estuary is presently an anoxic water body . The upper part of the sediment core , characterized by very high TOC value of more than 10 % , and absence of bioturbation along with strong lamination indicate anoxic water since 1970 AD , determined by C-14 dating . However , before 1970 AD , lower TOC content and presence of bioturbation and homogenous sediment with animal trace suggest the presence of oxic bottom water and thus a much better physicochemical condition . The lower part of the core may also suggest the influence of gradual global warming . Regular lamination in the upper portion of the core probably resulted from monsoon pulse with material preserved under anoxic condition .

aVLong-distance migratory bird often show little phenotypic variation in the timing of life-history event like breeding , molt , or migration . It ha been hypothesized that this could result from low level of heritable variation . If this were true , the adaptability of long-distance migratory bird would be limited , which would explain the vulnerability of this group of bird to environmental change . The amount of phenotypic , environmental , and genetic variation in the onset of autumn migratory activity wa assessed in two garden warbler ( Sylvia borin ) population differing in breeding phenology and the length of the breeding season with the aim of investigating the effect of selection on the adaptability of long-distance migrant . High heritabilities and additive genetic variance component for the timing of autumn migration were found in both population . Although genetic variation in the mountain population wa lower than in the lowland , this difference wa not statistically significant . Moreover , no evidence wa found for reduced level of genetic variation in the garden warbler a compared to it sister specie , the blackcap ( S. atricapilla ) . Environmental variation , however , wa markedly reduced in the garden warbler , suggesting that low level of phenotypic variation typically found in long-distance migrant may be a consequence of environmental canalization of migratory trait . The buffering of environmental variation may be an adaptive response to strong stabilizing selection on the timing of migration . High environmental canalization of migration phenology in long-distance migrant could potentially explain low rate of immediate phenotypic change in response to environmental change .

aVOne of the possible consequence of global warming is that there will be more day with precipitation throughout the year , and also that the level of precipitation will be higher . In this paper a detailed statistical analysis of a century of daily precipitation level is provided for the central meteorological station in the Netherlands . This paper show that the often-considered gamma distribution doe not fit well to sample of yearly data . It is argued that it incorrect use can lead to spuriously high probability of extreme precipitation level . Relying on advanced nonparametric technique , it is first found that there are fewer rainy day in the central part of the Netherlands . Next , more rainy day involve higher precipitation level . Most importantly , no statistically significant shift is found in the annual largest value of daily rainfall over the course of the century , which suggest that the probability of extremely high level ha not changed over time .

aVThe infrared and ultraviolet-visible absorption cross section , effective quantum yield of photolysis , and OH , Cl , and NO3 reaction rate coefficient of CHF2CHO are reported . Relative rate measurement at 298 +/- 2 K and 1013 +/- 10 hPa gave k ( OH ) , = ( 1.8 +/- 0.4 ) x 10 ( -12 ) cm ( -3 ) molecule ( -1 ) s ( -1 ) ( propane a reference compound ) , k ( Cl ) = ( 1.24 +/- 0.13 ) x 10 ( - 11 ) cm ( 3 ) molecule ( -1 ) s ( -1 ) ( ethane a reference compound ) , and k ( NO3 ) = ( 5.9 +/- 1.7 ) x 10 ( -17 ) cm ( -1 ) molecule ( -1 ) s ( -1 ) ( trans-dichloroethene a reference compound ) . The photolysis of CHF2CHO ha been investigated under pseudonatural tropospheric condition in the European simulation chamber , Valencia , Spain ( EUPHORE ) , and an effective quantum yield of photolysis equal to 0.30 +/- 0.05 over the wavelength range 290-500 nm ha been extracted . The tropospheric lifetime of CHF2CHO is estimated to be around 1 day and is determined by photolysis . The observed photolysis rate of CH3CHO , CHF2CHO , and CF3CHO are discussed on the basis of result from quantum chemical calculation .

aVThis communication present global statistic of daily mean temperature change a a function of previous day temperature anomaly . The relationship obtained clearly exhibit property of response function : the larger the anomaly , the larger the expected magnitude of temperature change backward to the long-term average value . Worldwide statistic reveals that this temperature response function is inherently nonlinear and climate specific . However the central part around the origin can be approximated well by a linear fit . At a large number of geographic location , the intercept have small offset toward nonzero value , and these offset are geographically correlated . We show that one possible reason is a marked asymmetry of temperature fluctuation , that is warming step have significantly higher frequency and lower average magnitude than those of cooling step , almost everywhere . These two opposing effect could result in stationary fluctuation around an annual cycle , however , our statistic clearly indicates the presence of global warming .

aVAnthropogenic release of greenhouse gas , especially CO2 and CH4 ha been recognized a one of the main cause of global warming . Several measure under the Kyoto Protocol 1997 have been drawn up to reduce the greenhouse gas emission . One of the measure is Clean Development Mechanisms ( CDM ) that wa created to enable developed country to cooperate with developing country in emission reduction activity . In Malaysia , palm oil industry particularly from palm oil mill effluent ( POME ) anaerobic treatment ha been identified a an important source of CH4 . However.. there is no study to quantify the actual CH4 emission from the commercial scale wastewater treatment facility . Hence , this paper shall address the CH4 emission from the open digesting tank in Felda Serting Hilir Palm Oil Mill . CH4 emission pattern wa recorded for 52 week from 3600 m 3 open digesting tank . The finding indicated that the CH4 content wa between 13.5 % and 49.0 % which wa lower than the value of 65 % reported earlier . The biogas flow rate ranged between 0.8 l min ( -1 ) m ( -2 ) and 9.8 l min ( -1 ) m ( -2 ) . Total CH4 emission per open digesting tank wa 519.9 kg day ( -1 ) . Relationships between CH4 emission and total carbon removal and POME discharged were also discussed . Fluctuation of biogas production wa observed throughout the study a a result of seasonal oil palm cropping , mill activity , variation of POME quality and quantity discharged from the mill . Thus only through long-term field measurement CH4 emission can be accurately estimated . ( c ) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVThis study focus on some of the program and measure Brazil ha undertaken over the past two or three decade in order to mitigate economic or environmental problem , which have also had positive effect on the reduction of the country 's carbon dioxide emission . Results show that , in the year 2000 alone , some 11 % in CO2 emission from energy use in Brazil have been reduced compared to what would have been emitted that year had the action reviewed here not been implemented in good time . As these action have not been motivated a a strategy to curb global climate change , if their benefit related to avoided carbon emission are not fully appraised in the near future , chance are that these policy may be discontinued . For instance , in the case of the business-as-usual scenario drawn up by the Ministry of Mines and Energy in 2001 , the discontinuity of the policy analyzed here would result in CO2 emission 20 % higher by 2020 , compared to what would happen were these policy kept over the long term . Therefore , the perspective presented here spotlight some of the hidden benefit of the program and measure underway in the country , justifying their continuation or even intensification .

aVSoil and crop management practice may influence biomass growth and yield of cotton ( Gossypium hirsutum L. ) and sorghum ( Sorghum bicolor L. ) and sequester significant amount of atmospheric CO , in plant biomass and underlying soil , thereby helping to mitigate the undesirable effect of global warming . This study examined the effect of three tillage practice [ no-till ( NT ) , strip till ( ST ) , and chisel till ( CT ) ] , . four cover crop [ legume ( hairy vetch ) ( Vicia villosa Roth ) , nonlegume ( rye ) ( Secale cereale L ) , hairy vetch/rye mixture , and winter weed or no cover crop ] , and three N fertilization rate ( 0 , 60-65 , and 120-130 kg N ha ( -1 ) ) on the amount of C sequestered in cotton lint ( lint + seed ) , sorghum grain . their stalk ( stem + leaf ) and root , and underlying soil from 2000 to 2002 In central Georgia , USA . A field experiment wa conducted on a Dothan sandy loam ( fine-loamy , kaolinitic , thermic . Plinthic Kandiudults ) . In 2000 , C accumulation in cotton lint wa greater in NT with rye or vetch/rye mixture but in stalk , it wa greater in ST with vetch or vetch/rye mixture than in CT with or without cover crop . Similarly , C accumulation in lint wa greater in NT with 60 kg N ha ( -1 ) but in stalk , it wa greater in ST with 60 and 120 kg N ha ( -1 ) than in CT with 0 kg N ha ( -1 ) . In 2001 , C accumulation in sorghum grain and stalk wa greater in vetch and vetch/rye mixture with or without N rate than in rye without N rate . In 2002 , C accumulation in cotton lint wa greater in CT with or without N rate but in stalk , it wa greater in ST with 60 and 120 kg N ha ( -1 ) than in NT with or without N rate . Total C accumulation in the above- and belowground biomass in cotton ranged from 1.7 to 5.6 Mg ha ( -1 ) and in sorghum ranged from 3.4 to 7.2 Mg ha ( -1 ) . Carbon accumulation in cotton and sorghum root ranged from 1 to 14 % of the total C accumulation in above- and belowground biomass . In NT , soil organic C at 0-10 cm depth wa greater in vetch with 0 kg N ha ( -1 ) or in vetch/rye with 120-130 kg N ha ( -1 ) than in weed with 0 and 60 kg N ha ( -1 ) but at 10-30 cm , it wa greater in rye with 120-130 kg N ha ( -1 ) than in weed with or without rate . In ST , soil organic C at 0-10 cm wa greater in rye with 120-130 kg N ha ( -1 ) than in rye , vetch , vetch/rye and weed with 0 and 60 kg N ha ( -1 ) . Soil organic C at 0-10 and 10-30 cm wa also greater in NT and ST than in CT . Since 5 to 24 % of C accumulation in lint and grain were harvested , C sequestered in cotton and sorghum stalk and root can be significant in the terrestrial ecosystem and can significantly increase C storage in the soil if these residue are left after lint or grain harvest , thereby helping to mitigate the effect of global warming . Conservation tillage , such a ST , with hairy vetch/rye mixture cover crop and 6065 kg N ha ( -1 ) can sustain C accumulation in cotton lint and sorghum grain and increase C storage soil compared with conventional tillage , such a CT , with no cover crop and N fertilization , thereby maintaining crop yield , improving soil quality , and reducing erosion .

aVIncreased concern about the environmental impact of the refrigeration technology is leading toward design solution aimed at improving the energy efficiency of the related application , using eco-friendly refrigerant , i.e . ozone-friendly and with the least possible global warming potential ( GWP ) . In this respect , carbon dioxide ( ASHRAE R744 ) is seen today a one of the most promising refrigerant and is raising great interest in industrial and scientific field . In the present work , the plant option are investigated , which are related to the design of air/water heat pump for tap water using CO2 . A comparison is made , in term of energy efficiency , between a system working with CO2 and a similar one working with HFC R134a ; such a comparison is carried out by mean of a simulation model of a refrigerating machine/heat pump , characterized by a detailed representation of the heat exchanger , based on their subdivision into elementary volume . Results show that carbon dioxide is an interesting substitute for synthetic fluid , if the design of the system is focused to take advantage of it property . ( C ) 2005 Elsevier Ltd and IIR .

aVThis paper review problem connected to the use of the deep-sea and sub-sea geological formation for carbon sequestration . We will focus on the risk and danger involved in using this kind of large-scale engineering approach , which is not yet fully tested , to combat global warming . We will not provide a complete discussion on the technology involved , but concentrate on a few principal question , such a the responsibility of environmental scientist involved in this research . We will also discus carbon sequestration in relation to the precautionary approach . We argue that there may be a place for large-scale engineering attempt , but this should be the last rather than the first option .

aVDrought is one of the major factor limiting crop production globally , with increasing global climate change making the situation more serious . Wheat is the staple food for more than 35 % of world population , so wheat anti-drought physiology study is of importance to wheat production and biological breeding for the sake of coping with abiotic and biotic condition . Much research is involved in this hot topic , but the pace of progress is not so large because of drought resistance being a multiple-gene-control quantitative character and wheat genome being larger ( 16,000 Mb ) . On the other hand , stress adaptive mechanism are quite different , with stress degree , time course , material , and experimental plot , thus increasing the complexity of the issue in question . Additionally , a little study is related to the whole life circle of wheat , which can not provide a comprehensive understanding of it anti-drought machinery . We selected 10 kind of wheat genotype a material , which have potential to be applied in practice , and measured relative change of anti-oxidative enzyme and membrane peroxidation through wheat whole growth-developmental circle ( i.e . seedling , tillering and maturing ) . Here , we firstly reported the result of seedling stage a follows : ( 1 ) 10 wheat genotype can be grouped into three kind ( A-C , respectively ) according to their changing trend of the measured index ; ( 2 ) A performed better resistance drought under the condition of treatment level 1 ( appropriate level ) , whose activity of anti-oxidative enzyme ( POD , SOD , CAT ) were higher and MDA lower and chlorophyll a + b higher ; ( 3 ) B exhibited stronger anti-drought under treatment level 2 ( light stress level ) , whose activity of anti-oxidative enzyme were higher , MDA lower and chlorophyll higher ; ( 4 ) C expressed anti-drought to some extent under treatment level 3 ( serious stress ) , whose activity of anti-oxidative enzyme were stronger , MDA lower and chlorophyll higher ; ( 5 ) these result demonstrated that different wheat genotype have different physiological mechanism to adapt themselves to changing drought stress , whose molecular basis is discrete gene expression profiling ( transcriptom ) ; ( 6 ) our result also showed that the concept accepted by most researcher , 70-75 % QF [ T.C . Hsiao , Plant response to water stress , Ann . Rev . Plant Physiol . 24 ( 1973 ) 519-570 ] is a proper supply for plant , wa doubted , because this level could not reflect the true suitable level of wheat . The study in this respect is the key to wheat anti-drought and biological saving-water ; ( 7 ) our research can provide insight into physiological mechanism of crop anti-drought and direct practical material for wheat anti-drought breeding .

aVThe disappearing glacier of Kilimanjaro are attracting broad interest . Less conspicuous but ecologically far more significant is the associated increase of frequency and intensity of fire on the slope of Kilimanjaro , which lead to a downward shift of the upper forest line by several hundred meter a a result of a drier ( warmer ) climate since the last century . In contrast to common belief , global warming doe not necessarily cause upward migration of plant and animal . Here , it is shown that on Kilimanjaro the opposite trend is under way , with consequence more harmful than those due to the loss of the showy ice cap of Africa 's highest mountain .

aVThe Mediterranean Basin is expected to be more strongly affected by ongoing global climate change than most other region of the earth . Given the magnitude of forecasted trend , there are great concern for the particularly rich biodiversity found in the region . Studies of the consequence of past climate shift on biodiversity represent one of the best source of data to validate model of the ecological and evolutionary consequence of future change . Here we review recent finding from palaeoecology , phylogeography and climate change research to ( 1 ) explore possible antecedent of the predicted climate warming in the younger geological history of the Mediterranean Basin , ( 2 ) ass how tree population have reacted to them , and ( 3 ) evaluate the significance of the evolutionary heritage that is at stake . A major question of our retrospective approach is whether Quaternary tree extinction took place primarily during glacial or during interglacial episode . Available data are scanty and somewhat conflicting . In contrast , abundant phylogeographic evidence clearly indicates that the bulk of genetic diversity in European temperate tree specie is almost invariably located in the southernmost part of their range . Long-term persistence of isolated population have been common phenomenon in the Mediterranean , to the point that the current genetic structure in this area probably often reflects population divergence that pre-dates the onset of the Mediterranean climate in the Pliocene . In particular , Tertiary migration into the Mediterranean of tree taxon originating from Asia seem to have left their footprint in the current genetic structure in these slowly evolving organism . Moreover , phylogeographic study point to heterogeneous rate of molecular evolution across lineage that are inversely related with their stability . We conclude that relict tree population in the Mediterranean Basin represent an evolutionary heritage of disproportionate significance for the conservation of European plant biodiversity .

aVWhen changing from grass and croplands to forest , there are two competing effect of land cover change on climate : an albedo effect which lead to warming and an evapotranspiration effect which tends to produce cooling . It is not clear which effect would dominate . We have performed simulation of global land cover change using the NCAR CAM3 atmospheric general circulation model coupled to a slab ocean model . We find that global replacement of current vegetation by tree would lead to a global mean warming of 1.3 degree C , nearly 60 % of the warming produced under a doubled CO2 concentration , while replacement by grassland would result in a cooling of 0.4 degree C. It ha been previously shown that boreal forestation can lead to warming ; our simulation indicate that mid-latitude forestation also could lead to warming . These result suggest that more research is necessary before forest carbon storage should be deployed a a mitigation strategy for global warming .

aVInsect outbreak are expected to increase in frequency and intensity with projected change in global climate through direct effect of climate change on insect population and through disruption of community interaction . Although there is much concern about mean change in global climate , the impact of climatic variability itself on specie interaction ha been little explored . Here , we compare caterpillar-parasitoid interaction across a broad gradient of climatic variability and find that the combined data in 15 geographically dispersed database show a decrease in level of parasitism a climatic variability increase . The dominant contribution to this pattern by relatively specialized parasitoid wasp suggests that climatic variability impairs the ability of parasitoids to track host population . Given the important role of parasitoids in regulating insect herbivore population in natural and managed system , we predict an increase in the frequency and intensity of herbivore outbreak through a disruption of enemy-herbivore dynamic a climate become more variable .

aVNematodes of the subfamily Nematodirinae are characteristic component of a Holarctic fauna . The topology of a generic-level phylogenetic hypothesis , pattern of diversity . and geographic distribution for respective nematode taxon in conjunction with data for host occurrence are consistent with primary distribution determined across Beringia for specie of Murielus , Rauschia , Nematodirus , and Nematodirella . Ancestral host are represented by Lagomorpha , with evidence for a minimum of 1 host-switching-event and subsequent radiation in the Artiodactyla . Diversification may reflect vicariance of respective fauna along with episodic or cyclical range expansion and isolation across Beringia during the late Tertiary and Quaternary . Secondarily , specie of Nematodirus attained a distribution in the Neotropical region with minimal diversification of an endemic fauna represented by Nematodirus molini among tayassuids , Nematodirus lamae among camelids and Nematodirus urichi in cervid during the Pleistocene . Nematodirines are a core component of an Arctic-Boreal fauna of zooparasitic nematode ( defined by latitude and altitude ) adapted to transmission in extreme environment characterized by seasonally low temperature and varying degree of desiccation . The history and distribution of this fauna is examined in the context of biotic and abiotic determinant for geographic colonization and host switching with an exploration of predicted response of complex host-parasite system to ecological perturbation under a regime of global climate change .

aVPalaeobiologists have investigated the evolutionary response of extinct organism to climate change , and have also used extinct organism to reconstruct palaeoclimates . There is evidence of a disconnection between climate change and evolution that suggests that organism may not be accurate palaeoclimate indicator . Here , marmot ( Marmota sp . ) are used a a case study to examine whether similarity of climate preference is correlated with evolutionary relatedness of specie . This study test for a relationship between phylogenetic distance and 'climate distance ' of specie within a clade . There should be a significant congruence between maximum likelihood distance and standardized Euclidian distance between climate if daughter specie tend to stay in environment similar to parent specie . Marmots make a good test case because there are many extant specie , their phylogeny are well established and individual survival is linked to climatic factor . A Mantel test indicates a significant correlation between climate and phylogenetic distance matrix , but this relationship explains only a small fraction of the variance ( regression R-2 = 0.114 ) . These result suggest that ( i ) closely related specie of marmot tend to stay in similar environment ; ( ii ) marmot may be more susceptible than many mammal to global climate change ; and ( iii ) because of the considerable noise in this system , the correlation can not be used for detailed palaeoclimate reconstruction .

aVPresented paper analysis climate trend in Poland in the second half of the 20 ( th ) century . Measurements of climate element were obtained from 5 meteorological station evenly distributed over Poland ( Szczecin 53 degree 24'N-14 degree 37'E , Wroclaw 51 degree 08'N-16 degree 59'E , Lodz 51 degree 44'N-19 degree 24'E , Suwalki 54 degree 08'N-22 degree 57'E , Przemysl 49 degree 48'N-22 degree 46'E ) . The variability of several index conditioning the growth of plant vegetation wa determined . Increase in the air temperature in the first three quartile of the calendar year wa detected . During November-December period the opposite tendency were noted , however not statistically significant . The length of winter period shortened considerably , especially in western Poland . The warming caused substantial rise in potential evapotranspiration , the largest in April , May and August . Summer period ha extended during the last five decade . Cumulative temperature , calculated with respect to the 10 degree C threshold , also revealed an upward tendency . Sunshine duration total increased - the highest increase wa observed in the western Poland in May-June season . The length of vegetation season ( > 5 degree C ) did not change significantly during the 50-year period . There wa only a slight tendency towards the earlier occurrence of both beginning and ending date of this season . The climate transformation in Poland , related undoubtedly to global warming , indicates possible intensification of vegetation growth due to more favourable solar and thermal condition .

aVThis paper present a recent methodology developed for the analysis of the slow evolution of geophysical time series . The method is based on least-squares fitting of continuous line segment to the data , subject to flexible condition , and is able to objectively locate the time of significant change in the series tendency . The time distribution of these breakpoints may be an important set of parameter for the analysis of the long term evolution of some geophysical data , simplifying the intercomparison between datasets and offering a new way for the analysis of time varying spatially distributed data . Several application example , using data that is important in the context of global warming study , are presented and briefly discussed .

aVReorganizations of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation were associated with large and abrupt climatic change in the North Atlantic region during the last glacial period ( 1-4 ) . Projections with climate model suggest that similar reorganization may also occur in response to anthropogenic global warming ( 5-7 ) . Here I use ensemble simulation with a coupled climate-ecosytem model of intermediate complexity to investigate the possible consequence of such disturbance to the marine ecosystem . In the simulation , a disruption of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation lead to a collapse of the North Atlantic plankton stock to le than half of their initial biomass , owing to rapid shoaling of winter mixed layer and their associated separation from the deep ocean nutrient reservoir . Globally integrated export production decline by more than 20 per cent owing to reduced upwelling of nutrient-rich deep water and gradual depletion of upper ocean nutrient concentration . These model result are consistent with the available high-resolution palaeorecord , and suggest that global ocean productivity is sensitive to change in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation .

aVIn order to examine the effect of global warming on the decomposition of forest leaf litter in Southern China , a reciprocal experiment wa designed to decompose forest leaf litter in two site across climatic zone . One site wa located on Mt Jianfengling in the tropical zone and the other , on Mt Dinghushan in the subtropical zone . Both site were located in NSTEC ( North-South Transect in Eastern China ) , in which the temperature gradient along the transect wa the major driver . The two site had similar altitude , soil type , annual mean rainfall and dry and wet season . The difference of annual mean-temperature between site wa 3.7 degree C. Leaf litter of 10 native dominant tree specie were collected from the two site and divided into single-species litter and mixed litter , and they were incubated on the forest floor of the two site reciprocally . The result indicated that litter decomposed in the tropical site 1.36-3.06 time more rapidly than in the subtropical site . Apparent Q ( 10 ) , calculated on the basis of the difference of temperature between site , ranged from 3.7 to 7.5 . The conclusion wa that global warming would increase the rate of matter circulation in the subtropical forest ecosystem in China . Mixed litter decomposed more rapidly than single-species litter in subtropical site . Not all dominant specie litter could represent mixed litter in decomposition . The variability of decomposition rate among the litter type wa le in the tropical site than in the subtropical site . Therefore , the effect of litter quality on litter decomposition wa le significant in the warmer condition of the tropic .

aVThe burning of fossil fuel is producing the greenhouse gas CO2 at a rate that is causing global warming and threatens to change the global environment adversely . One proposed solution involves sequestering in the deep sea a substantial portion of the excess CO2 produced . Because large area would be affected and this environment harbor one of the world 's largest reservoir of biodiversity , the approach is controversial . In particular , deep-sea diversity is found largely in the animal that live in the sediment , but the effect of sequestered CO2 on these organism are not known . We therefore introduced & SIM ; 60 1 of liquid CO2 onto the seafloor at 3250 m depth and sampled & SIM ; 2 and & SIM ; 40 m from the deposition site 30 d later . The pore water in the sample taken near the site wa 0.75 pH unit more acidic ( pH decrease when CO2 concentration increase ) than that in sample taken farther away , Representative infauna had been killed in significantly greater number in the former than in the latter location . This demonstration that sequestered CO2 can adversely affect the deep-sea infauna brings CO2 sequestration in the deep sea into potential conflict with the preservation of deep-sea biodiversity .

aVDefining `` dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system '' in the context of Article 2 of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) present a complex challenge for those developing long-term climate policy . Natural science ha a key role to play in quantifying vulnerability of element of the Earth system and estimating the risk from a changing climate . But attempt to interpret Article 2 will inevitably draw on understanding from social science , psychology , law , and ethic . Here I consider the limit of science in defining climate `` danger '' by focusing on the potential disintegration of the major ice sheet a an example of an extreme impact . I show that consideration of timescale , uncertainty , and learning preclude a definition of danger drawn purely from natural science . Decisionmakers will be particularly challenged by one characteristic of global problem : answer to some scientific question become le accurate over decadal timescales , meandering toward the wrong answer , a feature I call negative learning . I argue for a precautionary approach to Article 2 that would be based initially on current , limited scientific understanding of the future of the ice sheet .

aVBrazil 's Amazon forest remained largely intact until the `` modern '' era of deforestation began with the inauguration of the Transamazon Highway in 1970 . Amazonian deforestation rate have trended upward since 1991 , with clearing proceeding at a variable but rapid pace . Although Amazonian forest are cut for various reason , cattle ranching predominates . The large and medium-sized ranch account for about 70 % of clearing activity . Profit from beef cattle is only one of the income source that make deforestation profitable . Forest degradation result from logging , ground fire ( facilitated by logging ) , and the effect of fragmentation and edge formation . Degradation contributes to forest loss . The impact of deforestation include loss of biodiversity , reduced water cycling ( and rainfall ) , and contribution to global warming . Strategies to slow deforestation include repression through licensing procedure , monitoring , and fine . The severity of penalty for deforestation need to be sufficient to deter illegal clearing but not so great a to be unenforceable . Policy reform is also needed to address root cause of deforestation , including the role of clearing in establishing land claim .

aVThis work present that carbon dioxide , which is a main contributor to the global warming effect , could be utilized a a selective oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene . The dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene over alumina-supported vanadium-antimony oxide catalyst ha been studied under different atmosphere such a inert nitrogen , steam , oxygen or carbon dioxide a diluent or oxidant . Among them , the addition of carbon dioxide gave the highest styrene yield ( up to 82 % ) and styrene selectivity ( up to 97 % ) along with stable activity . Carbon dioxide could play a beneficial role of a selective oxidant in the improvement of the catalytic behavior through the oxidative pathway .

aVRestored forested wetland reduce N load in surface discharge through plant uptake and denitrification . While removal of reactive N reduces impact on receiving water , it is unclear whether enhanced denitrification also enhances emission of the 'greenhouse ' gas N2O , thus compromising the water-quality benefit of restoration . This Study compare denitrification rate and N2O : N-2 emission ratio from Sharkey clay soil in a mature bottomland forest to those from all adjacent cultivated site in the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley . Potential denitrification of forested soil wa 2.4 time of cultivated soil . Using intact soil core , denitrification rate of forested soil were 5.2 , 6.6 and 2.0 time those of cultivated soil at 70 , 85 and 100 % water-filled pore space ( WFPS ) , respectively . When NO3 wa added , N2O emission from forested soil were 2.2 time those of cultivated soil at 70 % WFPS . At 85 and 100 % WFPS , N2O emission were not significantly different despite much greater denitrification rate in the forested soil because N2O : N-2 emission ratio declined more rapidly in forested soil a WFPS increased . These finding suggest that restoration of forested wetland to reduce NO3 in surface discharge will not contribute significantly to the atmospheric burden of N2O .

aVWe reconsider the problem of the stability of the thermohaline circulation a described by a two-dimensional Boussinesq model with mixed boundary condition . We determine how the stability property of the system depend on the intensity of the hydrological cycle . We de . ne a two-dimensional parameter ' space descriptive of the hydrology of the system and determine , by considering suitable quasi-static perturbation , a bounded region where multiple equilibrium of the system are realized . We then focus on how the response of the system to finite-amplitude change in the surface freshwater forcings depends on their rate of increase . We show that it is possible to de . ne a robust separation between slow and fast regime of forcing . Such separation between slow and fast regime is obtained by singling out an estimate of the critical rate of increase for the anomalous forcing . The critical rate of increase is of the same order of magnitude of the ratio between the typical intensity of the hydrological cycle and the advective time scale of the system . Basically , if the change of the forcing is faster than the estimated critical rate , the system responds similarly to the case of instantaneous change of the same amplitude . Specularly , if the change of the forcing is slower than the critical rate , the behavior of the system resembles the response to quasi-static change of the same amplitude . Furthermore , since the advective time scale is proportional to the square root of the vertical diffusivity , our analysis support the conjecture that the efficiency of the vertical mixing might also be one of the key factor determining the response of the THC system to transient change in the surface forcings . These result should be taken into account when engineering global warming scenario and paleoclimatic experiment with GCMs .

aVCompact C2F4 gas supply equipment , which control the gas supply with sufficient accuracy by irradiation of a carbon dioxide laser ( CO2 ) onto a solid source ( PTFE ) without using any fluorocarbon gas , ha been developed to combat global warming . Although C2F4 gas ha a very low Global Warming Potential ( GWP < 1 ) , it is very unstable and thus considerably difficult to handle . This gas is used in the semiconductor manufacture process , where it is obtained from a conventional high-pressure cylinder . By changing the output of the laser , the amount Of C2F4 gas generated can be precisely controlled in this equipment while also ensuring safety . The gas is supplied to the VHF excited parallel plate plasma reactor through a gas shower head with Ar carrier gas and , in actual test , this environmental benign technology achieved high etching performance for low-k SiOCH and SiO2 film .

aVCorrelation of paleoclimatic evidence with orbital change show that the build-up of polar ice accelerated when low obliquity coincided with perihelion in Northern Hemisphere winter . Under low obliquity the insolation wa channeled to the tropic at the expense of both polar cap . As perihelion moved from winter solstice toward spring equinox , the solar beam in astronomic winter and spring became stronger than in summer and autumn . This orbital configuration under climate condition like today would lead to warming of tropical ocean but cooling of the polar region . The areally weighted global mean surface temperature , which is dominated by the low latitude , would increase . Consequently , during the first millennium , the early glacial ice build-up wa most likely accompanied by global warming . It wa the associated increase of meridional insolation and temperature gradient , which were instrumental in the transition to a glacial . A significant part of the current global warming is due to the gradual temperature increase of the tropical ocean . As the changing orbital configuration today resembles that of the last interglacial/glacial transition , the warming is likely to have a natural

aVThe current warming of the climate attracts considerable interest of many specialist working in the field of Earth science . Evidence supporting this global phenomenon stored to date is more than sufficient . Therefore , one of the most pressing issue today is to carry out a comprehensive analysis of observation made thus far on the state of the environment in the context of climate change . In this connection , problem are posed on the cause or source of the phenomenon addressed , the relationship between natural and anthropogenic factor , and the trend in the further evolution of planetary and regional climatic system . The World Conference on Climate Changes recently held in moscow wa devoted to precisely these problem . In the present communication , we have made yet another attempt to reveal specific feature of modern climate dynamic , particularly the secular variation of mean temperature in the lower atmosphere relative to global circulation . Based on analysis of change in the field of surface air temperature anomaly in the Northern Hemisphere , we suggest that global low-frequency disturbance observed in the atmosphere could be due to the contribution of the World Ocean in a large-scale redistribution of heat flux in the ocean-atmosphere-land climatic system .

aVWithin the Research Network on Agro-ecosystems Munich ( Forschungsverbund Agrarokosysteme Munchen , FAM ) strategy to approach optimal land use have been investigated since 1990 in term of minimization of environmental impact and maximization of profit from agricultural land . The purpose of this paper is to analyze the interaction of the economic and ecological demand on agricultural land use with model calculation for the integrated farm section of the research station of the Research Network , Klostergut Scheyern in Bavaria , Germany , with a whole farm modeling approach . For this purpose the model system MODAM wa used . MODAM simulates agricultural land use at farm level , calculates the economic return and environmental impact and run farm optimization with a linear programming tool . The integration of agri-environmental indicator in the model framework enables a multi-criteria optimization and the calculation of trade-off . Optimization run for the experimental farm show the complex interaction which occur when the farm considers environmental concern in the objective function . Trade offs and abatement cost curve illustrate the relationship between agri-environmental indicator and economic return of the farm . Here , soil erosion , nitrogen balance , global warming potential and gross energy input were implemented a agri-environmental indicator in MODAM . ( c ) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVGiven increasing concern over global climate change and national security there is a burgeoning interest in examining the relationship between economic growth and energy use in developed and developing country . More specifically , decoupling energy use per unit of gross domestic product ( GDP ) ha fast come to be seen a in the interest of national economy and the world a a whole . Recent attention ha been paid to the dramatic decrease in the energy intensity of the Chinese economy , which fell by 55 % between 1975 and 1995 . Do other developing economy follow similar trajectory ? This paper examines the energy intensity of the Mexican economy for the period 1988-1998 . Although the long-term trend in Mexican energy intensity is rising , the energy intensity of the Mexican economy began to decline in 1988 . This paper explores the factor that have contributed to this reduction . Diminishing Mexican energy use per unit of GDP ha been driven by significant decrease in industrial energy intensity . We show that these change have resulted from change in the composition of Mexican industrial structure and technological change . ( C ) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVMonthly measurement of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , methane ( CH4 ) and nitrous oxide ( N2O ) flux in peat soil were carried out and compared with groundwater level over a year at four site ( drained forest , upland cassava , upland and lowland paddy field ) located in Jambi province , Indonesia . Fluxes from swamp forest soil were also measured once per year a the native state of this investigated area . Land-use change from drained forest to lowland paddy field significantly decreased the CO2 ( from 266 to 30 mg C m ( -2 ) h ( -1 ) ) and N2O flux ( from 25.4 to 3.8 mu g N m ( -2 ) h ( -1 ) ) , but increased the CH4 flux ( from 0.1 to 4.2 mg C m ( -2 ) h ( -1 ) ) in the soil . Change from drained forest to cassava field significantly increased N2O flux ( from 25.4 to 62.2 mu g N m ( -2 ) h ( -1 ) ) , but had no significant influence on CO2 ( from 266 to 200 mg C m ( -2 ) h ( -1 ) ) and CH4 flux ( from 0.1 to 0.3 mg C m ( -2 ) h ( -1 ) ) in the soil . Averaged CO2 flux in the swamp forest ( 94 mg C m ( -2 ) h ( -1 ) ) were estimated to be one-third of that in the drained forest . Groundwater level of drained forest and upland crop field had been lowered by drainage ditch while swamp forest and lowland paddy field were flooded , although groundwater level were also affected by precipitation . Groundwater level were negatively related to CO2 flux but positively related to CH4 flux at all investigation site . The peak of the N2O flux wa observed at -20 cm of groundwater level . Lowering the groundwater level by 10 cm from the soil surface resulted in a 50 % increase in CO2 emission ( from 109.1 to 162.4 mg C m ( -2 ) h ( -1 ) ) and a 25 % decrease in CH4 emission ( from 0.440 to 0.325 mg C m ( -2 ) h ( -1 ) ) in this study . These result suggest that lowering of groundwater level by the drainage ditch in the peat land contributes to global warming and devastation of field . Swamp forest wa probably the best land-use management in peat land to suppress the carbon loss and greenhouse gas emission . Lowland paddy field wa a better agricultural system in the peat land in term of C sequestration and greenhouse gas emission . Carbon loss from lowland paddy field wa one-eighth of that of the other upland crop system , although the Global Warming Potential wa almost the same level a that of the other upland crop system because of CH4 emission through rice plant .

aVClimate change may affect hemiparasitic Orobanchaceae ( ex-Scrophulariaceae ) both directly through impact on hemiparasite physiology and indirectly through impact on host plant . This dual action suggests particular sensitivity of the parasite to climate change and any associated impact on host and other member of the community . While little research ha addressed the response of parasitic plant to climate change in natural environment , impact are predicted from controlled environment study together with a knowledge of the key ecophysiological trait of hemiparasitic Orobanchaceae , in particular of Striga specie , which are important weed in semi-arid tropical agro-ecosystems , and Rhinanthus specie , which can be important component of ( principally ) grassland community in the northern temperate zone . The main mode of action of both elevated CO2 and warming will be through change in photosynthesis and stomatal functioning . Enhanced photosynthesis of the hemiparasite and host will increase parasite carbon gain but may also increase the demand for host mineral nutrient . Mineral nutrition may , therefore , mediate the impact of climate change on host-parasite association . The relative insensitivity of hemiparasite stoma to elevated CO2 suggests that high stomatal conductance may be maintained and thus solute uptake may become limited by soil drying driven by higher rate of evapotranspiration and reduced precipitation . Climate change impact on host-parasite interaction at the individual level will ultimately affect hemiparasite impact at the community level . Community impact will be greatest where climate change considerably favour hemiparasite population or , conversely , cause them to disappear from community where they were formerly abundant . Impacts will further be mediated by climate impact on host , and the natural enemy of host and parasite alike . Further , the wide host range of many root hemiparasitic plant may facilitate migration of their population through new community under a changing climate .

aVWater deficit and high temperature are important environmental factor restricting plant growth and photosynthesis . The two stress often occur simultaneously , but their interaction on photosynthesis and nitrogen level have been le studied . In the present experiment , we measured photosynthetic parameter , stomatal density , and nitrogen level , a well a soluble sugar content of leaf of a perennial grass , Leymus chinensis , experiencing two day/night temperature regime of 30/20 degree C and 30/25 degree C , and five different soil moisture content ( the soil relative-water content ranged from 80 % to 25 % ) . Leaf relative water content , leaf biomass , whole plant biomass , the ratio between the leaf biomass and total plant biomass , and the photosynthetic rate , a well a water-use efficiency decreased at high night temperature , especially under severe water stress condition . Stomatal index wa also increased by soil water stress except very severe water stress , and high nocturnal temperature decreased the leaf stomatal index under soil water stress . Nocturnal warming decreased nitrogen concentration in the leaf and increased it in the root , particularly when plant were subjected to severe water stress . There were significant positive correlation between the photosynthetic rate and both soluble sugar concentration and nitrogen concentration at low nocturnal temperature . It is suggested that nocturnal warming significantly exacerbates the adverse effect of soil water stress , and their synergistic interaction might reduce the plant productivity and constrain it distribution in the region dominated by L. chinensis , based on prediction of global climate change .

aVThe change in model ENSO behavior due to an increase in greenhouse gas , according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) Business-As-Usual scenario , are investigated using a 62-member ensemble 140-yr simulation ( 1940-2080 ) with the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate System Model ( CCSM ; version 1.4 ) . Although the global mean surface temperature increase by about 1.2 K over the period 2000-80 , there are no significant change in the ENSO period , amplitude , and spatial pattern . To explain this behavior , an analysis of the simulation result is combined with result from intermediate complexity coupled ocean-atmosphere model . It is shown that this version of the CCSM is incapable of simulating a correct meridional extension of the equatorial wind stress response to equatorial SST anomaly . The wind response pattern is too narrow and it strength is insensitive to background SST . This lead to a more stable Pacific climate system , a shorter ENSO period , and a reduced sensitivity of ENSO to global warming .

aVSustainable development relies on the eco-efficient use of all flow in society ; more value created out of each resource unit . Supercritical water oxidation ( SCWO ) can be used for treatment of wet organic waste . The technology ha been under development for over 20 year but ha not yet been fully commercialized . SCWO allows for complete oxidation of all organic in sewage sludge and almost complete recovery of the inherent energy , essentially without harmful emission . In this paper , a life-cycle assessment ( LCA ) of sewage sludge SCWO ( Aqua-Critox ) is presented and the result are compared with LCA result for other sludge handling option : agricultural use , co-incineration with municipal solid waste , incineration with subsequent phosphorus extraction ( BioCon ) and sludge fractionation with phosphorus recovery ( Cambi-KREPRO ) . For SCWO , beneficial utilization of the heat of reaction is of crucial importance for the outcome . The electricity consumed by pumping and the nitrous oxide produced are other important parameter . The best sludge handling option from an environmental point of view depends on what aspect is considered more important in the impact assessment . Regarding global warming , the energy recovery method perform better than agricultural use .

aVLife cycle assessment ( LCA ) wa applied to perform an environmental comparison between the phosphate fertilizer fused magnesium phosphate ( FMP ) and triple superphosphate ( TSP ) . In order to perform the comparison a functional unit ( FU ) of 41.66 kg P2O5 , which corresponds to 208 kg FMP ( 20 % P2O5 ) and 93 kg TSP ( 45 % P2O5 ) wa defined . Concerning the product system a `` cradle to gate '' approach wa used in both case . In order to perform the life cycle impact assessment ( LCIA ) the impact category : global warming potential ( GWP ) , ozone depletion potential ( ODP ) , human toxicity potential ( HTP ) , fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity potential ( FWAETP ) , acidification potential ( AP ) and eutrophication potential ( EP ) were selected . The development of this step wa accomplished using CML 2 baseline 2000 method , with the help of the computational tool SimaPro 5 , version 5.1.0.21 . The study identified that in the case of FMP , the extensive electricity dependence is the main source of potential negative environmental impact . On the other hand , for the TSP , the great distance between the phosphate rock mine and the main manufacture center for both H3PO4 and TSP together with the transportation model adopted in this country appear a the main cause of environmental impact .

aVGoal , Scope and Method . The purpose of this environmental system analysis wa to investigate the impact of feed choice in three pig production scenario using substance flow model complemented by life cycle assessment methodology . The function of the system studied wa to grow piglet of 29 kg to finished pig of 115 kg . Three alternative scenario of protein supply were designed , one based on imported soybean meal ( scenario SOY ) ; one based on locally grown pea and rapeseed cake ( scenario PEA ) and one based on Swedish pea and rapeseed meal complemented by synthetic amino acid ( scenario SAA ) . The environmental impact of both feed production a such and the subsequent environmental impact of the feed in the pig production sub-system were analysed . The analysed feed ingredient were barley , wheat , pea , rapeseed meal , rapeseed cake , soybean meal and synthetic amino acid . The crude protein level of the feed affected the nitrogen content in the manure , which in turn affected nitrogen emission throughout the system and the fertilising value of the manure , ultimately affecting the need for mineral fertiliser application for feed production . Results and Discussion . The result showed that feed production contributed more than animal husbandry to the environmental burden of the system for the impact category energy use , global warming potential and eutrophication , whereas the opposite situation wa the case for acidification . The environmental impact of scenario SOY , PEA and SAA were 6.8 , 5.3 and 6.3 MJ/kg pig growth ; 1.5 , 1.3 and 1.4 kg CO2-eq/kg pig growth ; 0.55 , 0.55 and 0.45 kg O-2-eq/kg pig growth ; and 24 , 25 and 20 g SO2-eq/kg pig growth , respectively . The result suggested that scenario SAA wa environmentally preferable , and that the reason for this wa a low crude protein level of the feed and exclusion of soybean meal from the feed . Conclusions . Feed choice had an impact on the environmental performance of pig meat production , not only via the feature of the feed a fed to the pig , such a the crude protein content , but also via the raw material used , since the environmental impact from the production of these differs and since feed production had a large impact on the system a a whole .

aVZooplankton collection were made with a multiple opening/closing net and environmental sensing system ( MOCNESS ) both day and night in warm-core ring 82B in the North Atlantic Ocean and at night in the Slope Water between March and August 1982 . Species succession of euphausiids in 82B wa presented during the lifespan of this warm-core ring , aiming at providing basic information on possible response of North Atlantic marine ecosystem to global warming . Species succession of euphausiids ( 32 specie ) in this long-lived warm-core ring wa investigated . Major physical change of 82B occurred in March to April by convective mixing and thermostad cooling , in April/May by stratification of the surface water and in August by the interaction with Gulf Stream . Substantial change in specie composition were observed that corresponded to these physical change . Four different pattern were found in temporal change in abundance of warm-water specie . There were specie that decreased in number from March to August , specie that decreased from March to June , but increased in August , specie that increased from Match to August and specie that showed no systematic trend . These difference may be attributable to a specie tolerance to the thermostad temperature decrease and their vertical distribution . There wa also a large change from April to June with ascendance of the transition specie , Thysanoessa gregaria . Cold-water specie had variable pattern of abundance in 82B and occurred more abundantly in the Slope Water than in the ring . The monthly percentage decrease in the abundance of warm-water specie in 82B wa high compared with that of cold-water specie in cold-core ring a a result of the more rapid change in the physical structure and the shorter lifetime of warm-core ring in the western North Atlantic .

aVI constructed a temperature history for different part of the world from 169 glacier length record . Using a first-order theory of glacier dynamic , I related change in glacier length to change in temperature . The derived temperature history are fully independent of proxy and instrumental data used in earlier reconstruction . Moderate global warming started in the middle of the 19th century . The reconstructed warming in the first half of the 20th century is 0.5 kelvin . This warming wa notably coherent over the globe . The warming signal from glacier at low and high elevation appear to be very similar .

aVWe have developed a mass balance analysis of organic carbon ( OC ) across the five major river subsystem of the Mississippi ( MS ) Basin ( an area of 3.2 X 10 ( 6 ) km ( 2 ) ) This largely agricultural landscape undergoes a bulk soil erosion rate of similar to 480 t center dot km ( -2 ) center dot yr ( -1 ) ( similar to 1500 x 10 ( 6 ) t/yr , across the MS Basin ) , and a , soil organic carbon ( SOC ) erosion rate of similar to 7 t center dot km ( -2 center dot ) yr ( -1 ) ( similar to 22 x 10 ( 6 ) t/yr ) . Erosion translocates upland SOC to alluvial deposit , water impoundment , and the ocean . Soil erosion is generally considered to be a net source of CO ( 2 ) release to the atmosphere in global budget . However , our result indicate that SOC erosion and relocation of soil apparently can reduce the net SOC oxidation rate of the original upland SOC while promoting neu replacement of eroded SOC in upland soil that were eroded . Soil erosion at the MS Basin scale is , therefore , a net CO ( 2 ) sink rather than a source .

aVOne of the most daunting challenge for Chagas disease surveillance and control in Mexico is the lack of community level data on vector distribution . Although many state now have assembled representative domestic triatomine collection , only two triatomine specimen bad been collected and reported previously from the state of Guanajuato . Field personnel from the state 's Secretaria de Salud conducted health promotion activity in 43 of the 46 county in the state and received donation of a total of 2,522 triatomine specimen between 1998 and 2002 . All specimen were identified , and live insect examined for Trypanosoma cruzi . In an effort to develop fine-scale distributional data for Guanajuato , collection locality were georeferenced and ecological niche were modeled for each specie by using evolutionary-computing approach . Five specie were collected : Triatoma mexicana ( Herrich-Schaeffer ) , Triatoma longipennis ( Usinger ) , Triatoma pallidipennis ( Stal ) , Triatoma barberi ( Usinger ) , and Triatoma dimidiata ( Latreille ) from 201 community located at elevation of 870 - 2,200 m. Based on collection success , T mexicana had the broadest dispersion , although niche mapping indicates that T barberi represents the greatest risk for transmission of Chagas disease in the state . T dimidiata wa represented in collection by a single adult collected from one village outside the predicted area for all specie . For human , In estimated 3,755,380 individual are at risk for vector transmission in the state , with an incidence of 3,500 new case per year ; overall seroprevalences of 2.6 % indicate that 97,640 individual are infected with T cruzi at present , including 29,300 chronic case .

aVWe find that extreme temperature and precipitation event are likely to respond substantially to anthropogenically enhanced greenhouse forcing and that fine-scale climate system modifier are likely to play a critical role in the net response . At present , such event impact a wide variety of natural and human system , and future change in their frequency and/or magnitude could have dramatic ecological , economic , and sociological consequence . Our result indicate that fine-scale snow albedo effect influence the response of both hot and cold event and that peak increase in extreme hot event are amplified by surface moisture feedback . Likewise , we find that extreme precipitation is enhanced on the lee side of rain shadow and over coastal area dominated by convective precipitation . We project substantial , spatially heterogeneous increase in both hot and wet event over the contiguous United States by the end of the next century , suggesting that consideration of fine-scale process is critical for accurate assessment of local- and regional-scale vulnerability to climate change .

aVHigh-resolution analysis of a late Holocene core from Kettle Lake in North Dakota reveal coeval fluctuation in loss-on-ignition carbonate content , percentage of grass pollen , and charcoal flux . These oscillation are indicative of climate-fuel-fire cycle that have prevailed on the Northern Great Plains ( NGP ) for most of the late Holocene . High charcoal flux occurred during past moist interval when grass cover wa extensive and fuel load were high , whereas reduced charcoal flux characterized the intervening drought when grass cover , and hence fuel load , decreased , illustrating that fire is not a universal feature of the NGP through time but oscillates with climate . Spectral and wavelet analysis reveal that the cycle have a periodicity of approximate to 160 yr , although secular trend in the cycle are difficult to identify for the entire Holocene because the periodicity in the early Holocene ranged between 80 and 160 yr . Although the cycle are evident for most of the last 4,500 yr , their occasional muting add further to the overall climatic complexity of the plain . These finding clearly show that the continental interior of North America ha experienced short-term climatic cycle accompanied by a marked landscape response for several millennium , regularly alternating between dual landscape mode . The documentation of cycle of similar duration at other site in the NGP , western North America and Greenland suggests some degree of regional coherence to climatic forcing . Accordingly , the effect of global warming from increasing greenhouse gas will be superimposed on this natural variability of drought .

aV[ 1 ] We present the longest data set of observed soil moisture available in the world , 45 yr of gravimetrically-observed plant available soil moisture for the top 1 m of soil , observed every 10 day for April-October for 141 station from field with either winter or spring cereal from the Ukraine for 1958-2002 . We averaged the summer observation over the entire region to account for the observed scale of soil moisture variation , to enhance the portion of the variance that is related to meteorological forcing . The observation show a positive soil moisture trend for the entire period of observation , with the trend leveling off in the last two decade . Although model of global warming predict summer desiccation in a greenhouse-warmed world , there is no evidence for this in the observation yet , even though the region ha been warming for the entire period . While the interannual variation of soil moisture simulated by both the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Prediction and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalyses are close to the observation , neither reanalysis simulates the observed upward trend . Climate model simulation for the period show the same general shape a the observation , but differ quite a bit from each other and from the observation . An observed downward trend in insolation may have produced a downward trend in evaporation and may have contributed to the upward soil moisture trend .

aVMATSUI T. 2005 . Function of long basal dehiscence of the theca in rice ( Oryza sativa L. ) pollination under hot and humid condition . - Phyton ( Horn , Austria ) 45 ( 4 ) : ( 401 ) - ( 407 ) . Anticipated global warming is expected to increase floret sterility in rice ( Oryza sativa L. ) . For selection of-genotypes tolerant to high temperature during the flowering period , it is important to identify the morphological trait controlling tolerance to temperature stress . We investigated the relationship between the length of dehiscence at the basal part of theca and the viability of pollination in japonica type cultivar of rice subjected to a hot and humid condition ( 37/25 degree C , day/night , > 90 % relative humidity ) for three day at flowering . Control plant were left under the ambient condition in a semi-cylindrical house covered with cheesecloth ( 30 % shading ; temperature range : 24-35 degree C ) . The length of basal dehiscence of theca and the number of pollen grain on the stigma were examined with a light microscope after flowering . The percentage of floret with more than 20 pollen grain closely correlated with the length of basal dehiscence under the high-temperature treatment ( r = 0.906 , significant , P < 0.0001 ) and the percentage of floret with more than 80 pollen grain correlated with the length of the basal dehiscence of theca under the control condition ( r = 0.745 , significant , P < 0.01 ) . The length of basal dehiscence under the high-temperature treatment wa highly correlated with that in the control ( r = 0.911 , significant , P < 0.0001 ) . We concluded that the long basal dehiscence of the theca help the pollen grain to fall from the theca onto the stigma and increase the stability of the pollination under hot and humid condition a well a normal condition . We also concluded that we can estimate the tolerance of the variety to high temperature by measuring the basal dehiscence under a normal condition .

aVProjected change in precipitation characteristic around the mid-21st century and end-of-the-century axe analyzed using the daily precipitation output of the 3-member ensemble Meteorological Research Institute global ocean-atmosphere coupled general circulation model ( MRI-CGCM2 ) simulation under the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios ( SRES ) A2 and B2 scenario . It is found that both the frequency and intensity increase in about 40 % of the globe , while both the frequency and intensity decrease in about 20 % of the globe . These number differ only a few percent from decade to decade of the 21st century and between the A2 and B2 scenario . Over the rest of the globe ( about one third ) , the precipitation frequency decrease but it intensity increase , suggesting a shift of precipitation distribution toward more intense event by global warming . South China is such a region where the summertime wet-day frequency decrease but the precipitation intensity increase . This is related to increased atmospheric moisture content due to global warming and an intensified and more westwardly extended North Pacific subtropical anticyclone , which may be related with an El Nino-like mean sea surface temperature change . On the other hand , a decrease in summer precipitation is noted in North China , thus augmenting a south-to-north precipitation contrast more in the future .

aVWe measured nitrous oxide ( N2O ) , dinitrogen ( N-2 ) and methane ( CH4 ) flux in two constructed wetland ( CW ) in Estonia using the closed chamber method and the He-O method in the period from October 2000 to March 2003 . Emission rate of N2O-N , N-2-N and CH4-C from both CWs varied significantly on a both spatial and temporal scale , ranging from 1 to 2,600 , 170 to 130,000 , and -1.7 to 87,200 mu g m ( -2 ) h ( -1 ) respectively . The average flux of N2O from the microsites in the Kodijarve horizontal subsurface flow ( HSSF ) CW and Koo hybrid CW ranged from 27 to 370 and from 72 to 500 mu g N2O-N m ( -2 ) h ( -1 ) , respectively , whereas the average dinitrogen flux from the microsites in the HSSF CW in Kodijarve wa 2-3 magnitude higher than the N2O flux , ranging from 19,500 to 33,300 mu g N-2-N m ( -2 ) h ( -1 ) . The average methane emission from the microsites in the Kodijarve HSSF CW and the Koo hybrid CW ranged from 31 to 12,100 and from 950 to 5,750 mu g CH4-C m ( -2 ) h ( -1 ) , respectively . The highest emission value for all three gas were observed in the warm period . There wa a significant relationship between emission rate and water table depth : CH4 and N-2 emission increased and N2O emission decreased when the water table did rise . Although the emission of N2O and CH4 from CWs wa found to be relatively high , their global warming potential ( GWP ) in the time horizon of 100 year is not significant , ranging from 4.5 to 16.3 tonne Of CO2 equivalent per ha per year in Kodijarve and from 12.1 to 17.3 t CO2 equivalent ha ( -1 ) yr ( -1 ) in Koo .

aVElevated ocean temperature can cause coral bleaching , the loss of colour from reef-building coral because of a breakdown of the symbiosis with the dinoflagellate Symbiodinium . Recent study have warned that global climate change could increase the frequency of coral bleaching and threaten the long-term viability of coral reef . These assertion are based on projecting the coarse output from atmosphere-ocean general circulation model ( GCMs ) to the local condition around representative coral reef . Here , we conduct the first comprehensive global assessment of coral bleaching under climate change by adapting the NOAA Coral Reef Watch bleaching prediction method to the output of a low- and high-climate sensitivity GCM . First , we develop and test algorithm for predicting mass coral bleaching with GCM-resolution sea surface temperature for thousand of coral reef , using a global coral reef map and 1985-2002 bleaching prediction data . We then use the algorithm to determine the frequency of coral bleaching and required thermal adaptation by coral and their endosymbionts under two different emission scenario . The result indicate that bleaching could become an annual or biannual event for the vast majority of the world 's coral reef in the next 30-50 year without an increase in thermal tolerance of 0.2-1.0 degree C per decade . The geographic variability in required thermal adaptation found in each model and emission scenario suggests that coral reef in some region , like Micronesia and western Polynesia , may be particularly vulnerable to climate change . Advances in modelling and monitoring will refine the forecast for individual reef , but this assessment concludes that the global prognosis is unlikely to change without an accelerated effort to stabilize atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration .

aVThere is a broad consensus that the cost of abatement of global climate change can be reduced efficiently through the assignment of quota right and through international trade in these right . There is , however , no consensus on whether the initial assignment of emission permit can affect the Pareto-optimal global level of abatement . This paper provides some insight into the equity-efficiency puzzle . Qualitative result are obtained from a small-scale model ; then quantitative evidence of separability is obtained from MERGE , a multiregion integrated assessment model . It is shown that if all the cost of climate change can be expressed in term of GDP loss , Pareto-efficient abatement strategy are independent of the initial allocation of emission right . This is the case sometimes described a 'market damage ' . If , however , different region assign different value to nonmarket damage such a specie loss , different sharing rule may affect the Pareto-optimal level of greenhouse gas abatement . Separability may then be demonstrated only in specific case ( e.g . identical welfare function or quasi-linearity of preference or small share of wealth devoted to abatement ) .

aVGlobal climate change is altering the ecology of infectious agent and driving the emergence A disease in people , domestic animal , and wildlife . We present a novel , empirically based , predictive model for the impact of climate warming on development rate and availability of an important parasitic nematode of muskoxen in the Canadian Arctic , a region that is particularly vulnerable to climate change . Using this model , we show that warming in the Arctic may have already radically altered the transmission dynamic of this parasite , escalating infection pressure for muskoxen , and that this trend is expected to continue . This work establishes a foundation for understanding response to climate change of other host-parasite system , in the Arctic and globally .

aVTropical peatlands are important source and sink of atmospheric methane ( CH4 ) and major source of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) and nitrous oxide ( N2O ) . Recently , large area of tropical peatland have been developed for agriculture plantation in Southeast Asia whereby drainage is a prerequisite , which can increase greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emission substantially and therefore , global warming potential ( GWP ) . Despite this , there is still a paucity of knowledge on GHG emission from different ecosystem on tropical peatland and their role and contribution to the global gas budget . Thus , three ecosystem from tropical peatland of Sarawak , Malaysia , mixed peatswamp forest , oil palm ( Elaeis guineensis ) plantation and sago ( Metroxylon sagu ) plantation , were chosen for the study of GHG emission from the soil to determine their contribution towards GWP . The GHG emission were measured monthly over 12 month using a closed chamber technique . GWP from forest soil wa higher ( 7850 9 CO2 m ( -2 ) y ( -1 ) ) compared with oil palm ecosystem ( 5706 9 CO2 m ( -2 ) y ( -1 ) ) and sago ecosystem ( 4233 g CO2 m ( -2 ) y ( -1 ) ) . A high GWP in forest ecosystem wa due to it high soil respiration rate of 7817 9 CO2 m ( -2 ) y ( -1 ) . Soil respiration rate for sago and oil palm were 4074 g CO2 m ( -2 ) y ( -1 ) and 5652 g CO2 m ( -2 ) y ( -1 ) respectively . About 4 % of GWP from peat soil in sago ecosystem wa due to CH4 ( 5.5 9 CO2 m ( -2 ) y ( -1 ) ) and N2O ( 153.4 g CO2 m ( -2 ) y ( -1 ) ) emission , which were negligible in forest and oil palm ecosystem . Thus , the GWP of the soil in the three ecosystem on tropical peatland were mainly dominated by CO2 flux from the soil implying that tropical peatlands may function a a source for atmospheric CO2 on a global scale .

aVManaged grassland contribute to global warming by the exchange of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide , nitrous oxide and methane . To reduce uncertainty of the global warming potential of European grassland and to ass potential mitigation option , an integrated approach quantifying flux from all three gas is needed . Greenhouse gas emission from a grassland site in the SE of Scotland were measured in 2002 and 2003 . Closed static chamber were used for N2O and CH4 flux measurement , and sample were analysed by gas chromatography . Closed dynamic chamber were used for soil respiration measurement , using infrared gas analysis . Three organic manure and two inorganic fertilizer were applied at a rate of 300 kg N ha ( -1 ) a ( -1 ) ( available N ) and compared with a zero-N control on grassland plot in a replicated experimental design . Soil respiration from plot receiving manure wa up to 1.6 time larger than CO2 release from control plot and up to 1.7 time larger compared to inorganic treatment ( p < 0.05 ) . A highly significant ( p < 0.001 ) effect of fertilizer and manure treatment on N2O release wa observed . Release of N2O from plot receiving inorganic fertilizer resulted in short term peak of up to 388 g N2O-N ha ( -1 ) day ( -1 ) . However loss from plot receiving organic manure were both longer lasting and greater in magnitude , with an emission of up to 3488 g N2O-N ha ( -1 ) day ( -1 ) from the sewage sludge treatment . During the 2002 growing season the cumulative total N2O flux from manure treatment wa 25 time larger than that from mineral fertilizer . CH4 emission were only significantly increased ( p < 0.001 ) for a short period following application of cattle slurry . Although soil respiration in manure plot wa high , model prediction and micrometeorological flux measurement at an adjacent site suggest that all plot receiving fertilizer or manure acted a a sink for CO2 . Therefore in term of global warming potential the contribution of N2O from manure treatment becomes particularly important . There were considerable variation in N2O and CO2 flux between year , which wa related to annual variation in soil temperature and rainfall . ( c ) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All right reserved .

aVThis study wa conducted to estimate greenhouse gas ( GHG ) flux in field growing paddy and fallow ( PF ) , soybean and winter wheat ( SW ) , and spring and winter wheat ( WW ) on peatland dressed with mineral soil . Field measurement were carried out from June 2002 to May 2003 . GHG flux were measured in a closed chamber . Soil respiration wa measured in the SW and WW field , and photosynthetic CO2 flux during the daytime ( net ecosystem production , NEPday ) wa measured in the PF field . Microbial respiration ( R. ) in the SW and WW field wa approximated a 60 % of the total soil respiration . NEP wa calculated a the difference between plant dry matter ( net primary production , NPP ) and R-m. Aboveground plant part were collected from each field to calculate NPP of each crop . Rm in the PF field wa calculated a ( 3 ) /2NPP - NEPday , because aboveground respiration is 50 % of NPP . The global warming potential ( GWP ) in each ecosystem wa calculated using a 100-year time horizon , a recommended by the IPCC ( with factor of 21 for CH4 and 310 for N2O ) . R-m wa 682 g Cm-2 y ( -1 ) in PF , 533 in SW , and 388 in WW . NPP wa 651 , 397 , and 152 g C m ( -2 ) y ( -1 ) , respectively . Therefore , NEP wa -31 , -136 , and -236 g C m ( -2 ) y ( -1 ) , respectively . The PF field acted a a large CH4 source ( 85.2 g C m ( -2 ) y ( -1 ) ) because of flooding . The WW field wa a small source of CH4 ( 0.16 g C m ( -2 ) y ( -1 ) ) , and the SW field wa a small sink ( 0.14 g C m ( -2 ) y ( -1 ) ) . All field were source of N2O ( 1.36 g N m ( -2 ) y ( -1 ) in SW , 0.60 in WW , and 0.05 in PF ) . The rate of mineralization wa higher than the rate of N fertilizer application in SW and WW . The GWP wa equivalent to 2522 9 CO2 m ( -2 ) y ( -1 ) in the PF field , 11619 CO2 m ( -2 ) y ( -1 ) in the WW field , and 1157 9 CO2 m ( -2 ) y ( -1 ) in the SW field . The high value in the PF field wa due to high CH4 emission there .

aVNumerical model study have suggested that the ongoing global climate change will likely affect tropical cyclone activity . Since the global warming ha been underway , it is meaningful to ask : Are there evidence of observed change in tropical cyclone activity ? Using best-track data from 1965 to 2003 , we show for the first time that over the past four decade the two prevailing typhoon track in the western North Pacific ( WNP ) have shifted westward significantly ; thus the subtropical East Asia ha experienced increasing typhoon influence ; but the typhoon influence over the South China Sea ha considerably decreased . Our trajectory model simulation indicates that the long-term shift in the typhoon track result primarily from the change in the mean translation velocity of typhoon or the large-scale steering flow , which is associated with the westward expansion and strengthening of the WNP subtropical high .

aVIn recent year , requirement for the reduction of energy consumption ha been increasing to solve the problem of global warming and shortage of petroleum resource . In the power generation field , thermal power generation occupies 60 % of the power generation demand , so the improvement of thermal efficiency is of considerable importance . In this article , the heat transfer and pressure drop characteristic of finned tube bank used for heat exchanger in thermal power generation plant were studied experimentally . Serrated finned tube bank for improvement of higher heat transfer and conventional spiral finned tube bank were tested under the same test condition . Empirical equation to predict the heat transfer coefficient and the pressure drop were proposed .

aVThis article discus the horizontal distribution and dominant specie of heteropods in the East China Sea . The ecological characteristic of heteropods and their adaptability to the environment were also considered . Oceanographic census wa carried out in the East China Sea ( 23 degree 30'similar to 33 degree N and 118 degree 30'similar to 128 degree E ) in four season from 1997 to 2000 . It wa found that the total abundance showed obvious seasonal variation . It peaked in autumn with a mean value of 21.03 ind . ( 100 m ( 3 ) ) ( -1 ) , followed by summer ( 4.89 ind . ( 100 m ( 3 ) ) ( -1 ) ) . The lowest abundance occurred in winter and spring . As to the horizontal distribution , abundance in summer and autumn wa higher in the nearshore than in the offshore of the East China Sea . In winter and spring , heteropods were barely found in the northern nearshore . Three dominant specie were observed in four investigated season , in which only Atlanta rosea dominated in winter , spring and summer while Atlanta peroni and Atlanta lesueuri mainly dominated in autumn . These two dominant specie observed in autumn exhibited a rather higher occurrence frequency than A. rosea . Temperature wa found to be a major influencing factor whereas salinity wa a minor one . Comparing their adaptability , A. rosea can survive in a wider temperature range ( 16 similar to 28 degree C ) , which enables it to dominate in four season , while A. peroni survives in a relatively narrow temperature range ( 19 similar to 28 degree CC ) and the range for A. lesueuri wa even more narrow ( 21 similar to 28 degree CC ) . Moreover , A. rosea wa also adapted to a wider range of salinity . However , the abundance of A. rosea in autumn wa lower than those of A. peroni and A. lesueuri . It can be thereby inferred that the multiplication speed of A. rosea wa lower than the other two specie within the same favorable temperature range . Due to their adaptability to high salinity , the distribution of heteropods wa closely related to the domain of the Taiwan Warm Current and Kuroshio . Especially for A. peroni and A. lesueuri , their high abundance area are always indicative of the lasting existence of strong warm current . The negative value of aggregation index indicated relatively even distribution of heteropods in the East China Sea . The high abundance area ( 31 degree 00 ' N , 126 degree 00 ' E ) of heteropods in autumn is on the migration pathway of the mackerel ( Scomber japonicus Houttuyn ) . Thus , there is also a fishing ground of the mackerel . This suggested that the high abundance area of heteropods in autumn is important to the fishery in the East China Sea . Comparing with the historical record , the abundance of heteropods appeared to increase in the past 40 year . This may be a result of strengthened warm current due to global warming .

aVTwo global coupled climate model show that even if the concentration of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere had been stabilized in the year 2000 , we are already committed to further global warming of about another half degree and an additional 320 % sea level rise caused by thermal expansion by the end of the 21st century . Projected weakening of the meridional . overturning circulation in the North Atlantic Ocean doe not lead to a net cooling in Europe . At any given point in time , even if concentration are stabilized , there is a commitment to future climate change that will be greater than those we have already observed .

aVUsing econometric tool for selecting I ( 1 ) and I ( 2 ) trend , we found the existence of static long-run steady-state and dynamic long-run steady-state relation between temperature and radiative forcing of solar irradiance and a set of three greenhouse gas series . Estimates of the adjustment coefficient indicate that temperature series is error correcting around 5-65 % of the disequilibria each year , depending on the type of long-run relation . The estimate of the I ( 1 ) and I ( 2 ) trend indicate that they are driven by linear combination of the three greenhouse gas and their loading indicate strong impact on the temperature series . The equilibrium temperature change for a doubling of carbon dioxide is between 2.15 and 3.4 degree C , which is in agreement with past literature and the report of the IPCC in 2001 using 15 different general circulation model .

aVAverage global surface-air temperature is increasing . Contention exists over relative contribution by natural and anthropogenic forcings . Ecological study attribute plant and animal change to observed warming . Until now , temperature-species connection have not been statistically attributed directly to anthropogenic climatic change . Using modeled climatic variable and observed specie data , which are independent of thermometer record and paleoclimatic proxy , we demonstrate statistically significant `` joint attribution , '' a two-step linkage : human activity contribute significantly to temperature change and human-changed temperature are associated with discernible change in plant and animal trait . Additionally , our analysis provide independent testing of grid-box-scale temperature projection from a general circulation model ( HadCM3 ) .

aVThis paper review recent research on tropical cyclone and climate change from the perspective of event risk-the physical behavior of storm ; vulnerability-the characteristic of a system that create the potential for impact , but are independent of event risk ; and also outcome risk-the integration of consideration of vulnerability with event risk to characterize an event that cause loss . The paper concludes that with no trend identified in various metric of hurricane damage over the twentieth century , it is exceedingly unlikely 'that scientist will identify large change in historical storm behavior that have significant societal implication , though scientist may identify discernible change in storm behavior . Looking to the future , until scientist conclude a ) that there will be change to storm that are significantly larger than observed in the past , b ) that such change are correlated to measure of societal impact , and c ) that the effect of such change are significant in the context of inexorable growth in population and property at risk , then it is reasonable to conclude that the significance of any connection of human-caused climate change to hurricane impact necessarily ha been and will continue to be exceedingly small .

aVCarbon dioxide emission is well recognized a the main source of global warming . The catalytic hydrogenation of carbon dioxide to methanol represents an effective method for preventing this side effect . The objective of this paper is to present a hybrid neural network model ( NNM ) for the simulation of a differential catalytic hydrogenation reactor of carbon dioxide to methanol . The hybrid model consists of two part : a mechanistic model and a neural model . The mechanistic model employ heat transfer , mass transfer and pressure drop equation and calculates the effluent temperature of the reactor by taking outlet mole fraction from the output of a neural network model . The prepared hybrid model wa used to simulate and identify an existing industrial methanol reactor . The bed of the reactor wa assimilated to a pile of layer , each corresponding to a neural network ( NN ) model that can predict outlet composition of each layer a a function of time . The model wa successfully tested with plant experimental data . The insight of this research indicate a very fast responding model in comparison to traditional model to demonstrate CO2 reduction a a function of time and reactor length . Variation of temperature and other composition with time and bed height are also investigated in this article . ( c ) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All right reserved .

aVTree ring have been used to both reconstruct past climate , and to estimate and project carbon uptake of forest ecosystem . Here we show that large group of tree of the dominant tree specie within widely-distributed circumpolar forest site show opposing growth trend during recent warming . These opposing growth trend are present at a sub-chronology level and , if averaged into chronology , may have contributed to the widely reported overall decreased temperature sensitivity of high-latitude chronology over recent decade . Unlike previous study , we find that temperature sensitivity ha actually increased for most individual tree at these site . This recent , widespread divergence in growth response seems unique over the past three century , and may relate to different microsite response of individual tree to temperature-induced drought stress or other factor . This divergence need to be taken into account in dendroclimatic reconstruction , estimation of global warming impact , and carbon uptake projection .

aVFreezing temperature strongly influence vegetation in the hottest desert of North America , in part determining both it overall boundary and distribution of plant specie within . To evaluate recent variability of freezing temperature in this context , minimum temperature data from weather station in the Sonoran Desert are examined . Data show widespread warming trend in winter and spring , decreased frequency of freezing temperature , lengthening of the freeze-free season , and increased minimum temperature per winter year . Local land use and multidecadal mode of the global climate system such a the Pacific decadal oscillation and the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation do not appear to be principal driver of this warming . Minimum temperature variability in the Sonoran Desert doe , however , correspond to global temperature variability attributed to human-dominated global warming . With warming expected to continue at faster rate throughout the 21st century , potential ecological response may include contraction of the overall boundary of the Sonoran Desert in the south-east and expansion northward , eastward , and upward in elevation , a well a change to distribution of plant specie within and other characteristic of Sonoran Desert ecosystem . Potential trajectory of vegetation change in the Sonoran Desert region may be affected or made more difficult to predict by uncertain change in warm season precipitation variability and fire . Opportunities now exist to investigate ecosystem response to regional climate disturbance , a well a to anticipate and plan for continued warming in the Sonoran Desert region .

aVA ground surface temperature history for the lost 500 year wa created from the inversion of geophysical temperature log in four deep ( > 1400 m ) boreholes on the Blackwood Plateau in southwestern Australia . Modelled temperature change show close agreement with ground surface temperature history from elsewhere in the world for this period and indicate that the Blackwood Plateau ha experienced a 0.4 K increase in mean temperature between the beginning of the sixteenth century and the 1980s , with more than half of the increase having taken place after 1900 , The modelling indicates that the highest temperature in the region for the last 500 year were recorded during the twentieth century , and that the current rate of temperature change of more than 0.5 degree K per century is higher than at any other time during this time period .

aVArticulating the consequence of global climate change on terrestrial ecosystem biogeochemistry is a critical component of Arctic system study . Leaf mineral nutrition response of tundra plant is an important measure of change in organismic and ecosystem attribute because leaf nitrogen and carbon content effect photosynthesis , primary production , carbon budget , leaf litter , and soil organic matter decomposition a well a herbivore forage quality . In this study , we used a long term experiment where snow depth and summer temperature were increased independently and together to articulate how a series of climate change scenario would affect leaf N , leaf C , and leaf C : N for vegetation in dry and moist tussock tundra in northern Alaska , USA . Our finding were : 1 ) moist tundra vegetation is much more responsive to this suite of climate change scenario than dry tundra with up to a 25 % increase in leaf N ; 2 ) life form exhibit divergence in leaf C , N , and C : N with deciduous shrub and graminoids having almost identical leaf N content ; 3 ) for some specie , leaf mineral nutrition response to these climate change scenario are tundra type dependent ( Betula ) , but for others ( Vaccinium vitis-idaea ) , strong response are exhibited regardless of tundra type ; and 4 ) the seasonal pattern and magnitude of leaf C and leaf N in deciduous and evergreen shrub were responsive to condition of deeper snow in winter . Leaf N is wa generally higher immediately after emergence from the deep snow experimental treatment and leaf N wa higher during the subsequent summer and fall , and the leaf C : N were lower , especially in deciduous shrub . These finding indicate that coupled increase in snow depth and warmer summer temperature will alter the magnitude and pattern of leaf mineral nutrition and that the longterm consequence of these change may feed-forward and affect ecosystem process .

aVAfter ratification of the Kyoto Protocol , Canada 's Kyoto greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emission target is 571 Mt of CO2 equivalent emitted per year by 2010 ; however , if current emission trend continue , a figure of 809 Mt is projected by 2010 ( Cote C. Basic of clean development mechanism-joint implementation and overview of CDM project cycle , 2003 regional workshop on CDM-JI , February 2003 , Halifax ) . This underscore the need for additional reduction of 240 Mt . The Federal Government Action Plan 2000 aim to reduce this gap from 240 to 65 Mt ( Cote C. Basic of clean development mechanism-joint implementation and overview of CDM project cycle , 2003 regional workshop on CDM-JI , February 2003 , Halifax ) . In order to accomplish this goal , renewable energy use in all sector will be required , and this type of energy is particularly applicable in power generation . Traditional power generation is a major source of greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emission after industrial and transportation sector ( Environment Canada . Canada 's Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990-1998 . Final submission to the UNFCCC Secretariat , 2002 [ Available from : http : //www.ec.gc.ca/climate/resources_reportes-e.html ] . Although wind energy , solar power and other form of renewable energy are non-GHG emitting in their operation , there are GHG emission in their different stage of life cycle ( i.e . material extraction , manufacturing , construction and transportation , etc. ) . These emission must be accounted for in order to ass accurately their capacity to reduce GHG emission and meet Kyoto target . The current trend in electricity generation is towards integrated energy system . One such proposed system is the wind-fuel cell integrated system for remote community . This paper present a detailed Life Cycle Analysis of the wind-fuel cell integrated system for application in Newfoundland and Labrador . The study confirms that wind-fuel integrated system is a zero emission system while in operation . There are significant emission of GHGs during the production of the various component ( wind turbine , fuel cell and electrolyzer ) . However , the global warming potential , ( GWP ) of wind-integrated system is far lower ( at least by two order of magnitude ) than the conventional diesel system , presently used in remote community .

The result show that new manufacturing system of Pb-free bronze made by removing Pb from scrap Pb-bronze reduces such environmental impact a global warming , acidification , energy consumption , resource consumption significantly . Thus , in LCA perspective , the new manufacturing system using a recycling Pb-free bronze is superior to the former one using virgin material .

aVA general warming of climate in the future may profoundly affect wildlife population in term of number , distribution and characteristic of the individual , therefore leading to new challenge in term of management and conservation . The effect of global warming can already be detected through the analysis of long-term database , but insight into these process can also be acquired by studying change in wildlife population during period with clear trend in climatic change . We analysed ringing data from more than 38,000 teal Anas crecca caught at the Station Biologique de la Tour du Valat in the Camargue , Southern France , between September 1954 and April 1971 . Temperature in the Camargue clearly decreased over the ringing period . There wa no correlation between average annual body mass and temperature in any age or sex class , nor a significant effect of temperature on the age ratio of the population . In adult , there were more male when average daily maximum winter temperature increased , while the opposite trend wa found for juvenile . The clearest pattern we observed wa a positive relationship between temperature and wing length of the individual : in all sex and age class , bird tended to get smaller a temperature decreased . It is unlikely that this pattern wa related to harsh climate affecting teal feather growth . Rather , we hypothesise that climate affected the distribution of the individual in Europe : a temperature got colder , small bird found it still more difficult to remain in northern area and increasingly used the Camargue a a refuge . Reversing the observed pattern suggests that a global warming of climate in the future may have profound consequence for the distribution of wintering teal in Europe , a more and more bird will become able to remain in northern area closer to their breeding ground .

aVThe radiative response of tropical cloud to global warming exhibit a large spread among climate model , and this constitutes a major source of uncertainty for climate sensitivity estimate . To better interpret the origin of that uncertainty , we analyze the sensitivity of the tropical cloud radiative forcing to a change in sea surface temperature that is simulated by 15 coupled model simulating climate change and current interannual variability . We show that it is in regime of large-scale subsidence that the model result ( 1 ) differ the most in climate change and ( 2 ) disagree the most with observation in the current climate ( most model underestimate the interannual sensitivity of cloud albedo to a change in temperature ) . This suggests that the simulation of the sensitivity of marine boundary layer cloud to changing environmental condition constitutes , currently , the main source of uncertainty in tropical cloud feedback simulated by general circulation model .

aVClimate model used to produce global warming scenario exhibit widely diverging response of the thermohaline circulation ( THC ) . To investigate the mechanism responsible for this variability , a regional Atlantic Ocean model driven with forcing diagnosed from two coupled greenhouse gas simulation ha been employed . One of the coupled model ( MPI ) show an almost constant THC , the other ( GFDL ) show a declining THC in the twenty-first century . The THC evolution in the regional model corresponds rather closely to that of the respective coupled simulation , that is , it remains constant when driven with the forcing from the MPI model , and decline when driven with the GFDL forcing . These finding indicate that a detailed representation of ocean process in the region covered by the Atlantic model may not be critical for the simulation of the overall THC change in a global warming scenario , and specifically that the coupled model 's rather coarse representation of water mass formation process in the subpolar North Atlantic is unlikely to be the primary cause for the large difference in the THC evolution . Sensitivity experiment have confirmed that a main parameter governing the THC response to global warming is the density of the intermediate water in the Greenland - Iceland - Norwegian Seas , which in turn influence the density of the North Atlantic Deep Water , whereas change in the air - sea heat and freshwater flux over the subpolar North Atlantic are only of moderate importance , and mainly influence the interannual-decadal variability of THC . Finally , a a consequence of changing surface flux , the Labrador Sea convection cease by about 2030 under both forcings ( i. e. , even in a situation where the overall THC is stable ) indicating that the eventual breakdown of the convection is likely but need not coincide with substantial THC change .

aVAgriculture contributes considerably to the emission of greenhouse gas , such a N2O and CH4 . Here we summarize result from previous pot experiment assessing the effectiveness of urease and nitrification inhibitor reducing both N2O and CH4 emission from wheat and rice cropping system fertilized with urea ( U ) . For the wheat cropping system , using a cambisol , we observed that the application of U with hydroquinone ( HQ , a urease inhibitor ) , U with dicyandiamide ( DCD , a nitrification inhibitor ) and U with HQ plus DCD decreased the N2O emission by 11.4 , 22.3 and 25.1 % , respectively . For the rice copping system , using a luvisol , we found that the application of U with HQ , U with DCD and U with HQ plus DCD decreased N2O emission by 10.6 , 47.0 and 62.3 % , respectively , and CH4 emission by 30.1 , 53.1 and 58.3 % , respectively . In term of total global warming potential ( GWP ) a reduction of 61.2 % could be realized via the combined addition of HQ and DCD . The addition of wheat straw reduced the activity of HQ and DCD in the rice cropping experiment . In term of total GWP only a reduction of 30.7 % could be achieved . In general , both in upland and flooded condition , the application of HQ and DCD alone wa le effective than HQ in combination with DCD , but not significantly for U plus DCD treatment . Our observation may be further constrained , however , by practical , economic or social problem and should therefore be tested at the scale of a region ( e.g . a watershed ) and related to an integrated abatement of agricultural N loss .

aVThis study intended ( 1 ) to develop a quantitative method to describe vegetation succession or change by remote sensing approach , and ( 2 ) to test the capability in clarifying the stability or instability of natural forest in landscape scale . With special attention on the coniferous forest , the attempt wa conducted on the natural reserve of Changbai mountain in northeast China by using multi-temporal TM image . Two simple parameter were derived to represent succession rate or change extent . One wa the mean change of radiance , and another wa the number of pixel with changed reflection property . As conclusion , TM imagery is effective for detecting vegetation change . The result also demonstrated that the so called climax is not a pure stand , which is generally assumed to be exclusively dominated by climax specie , but rather a complex of shifting mosaic . The pioneer patch are permanent unit in the forest community . This method is considered applicable for assessing the developing status or behavior of plant community in large scale , like a life zone , under disturbance of global warming , especially for long-time span .

aVTHE SOUTHERN OCEAN PLAYS A MAJOR role in the global oceanic circulation , a a component of the Meridional Overturning Circulation , and it is postulated that it ha a great influence on present-day climate . However , our understanding of it complex three-dimensional dynamic and of the impact of it variability on the climate system is rudimentary . The newly constituted , international GoodHope research venture aim to address this knowledge gap by establishing a programme of regular observation across the Southern Ocean between the African and Antarctic continent . The objective of this programme are fivefold : ( 1 ) to improve understanding of Indo-Atlantic inter-ocean exchange and their impact on the global thermohaline circulation and thus on global climate change ; ( 2 ) to understand in more detail the influence these exchange have on the climate variability of the southern African subcontinent ; ( 3 ) to monitor the variability of the main Southern Ocean frontal system associated with the Antarctic Circumpolar Current ; ( 4 ) to study air-sea exchange and their role on the global heat budget , with particular emphasis on the intense exchange occurring within the Agulhas Retroflection region south of South Africa , and ( 5 ) to examine the role of major frontal system a area of elevated biological activity and a biogeographical barrier to the distribution of plankton . We present here preliminary result on the physical and biological structure of the frontal system using the first GoodHope transect that wa completed during February-March 2004 .

aVNITROGEN AVAILABILITY AND N2O FLUXES FROM PASTURE SOIL AFTER HERBICIDE APPLICATION Nitrous Oxide ( N2O ) play an important role in the greenhouse effect , owing to it high global warming potential and a long half-life in the atmosphere . A large portion of the natural N2O flux is oceanic and the remaining result mainly from the contribution of microbiological process ( nitrification and denitrification ) that occur in tropical soil . The availability of nitrogen ( N ) for metabolic process by microorganism may be an important factor controlling N2O in such soil . The goal of this study wa to improve the understanding of mechanism controlling N2O flux from soil under pasture in the Amazon . We investigated the effect of N and carbon ( C ) availability , and soil moisture on N2O emission from , two different pasture ( with or without treatment for recovery of productivity ) . The study wa developed under laboratory condition by incubating soil sample from the following pasture : ( a ) Control - Soil from a traditionally-managed pasture established in 1983 consisting of a mixture of Brachiaria brizantha and Panicum maximum , besides a type of weed ; and ( b ) Herbicide treated - total desiccation of pasture established in 1983 in preparation for cultivation of no-till rice and posterior grass replanting . It is important to emphasize that soil sample ( 0-5 cm depth ) were collected on the third day after herbicide application . To compare and understand N2O flux , we added nitrate , dextrose and water to the soil before incubation and used acetylene to block N2O oxidation to N-2 , in order to estimate the N-2 emitted from the soil . The highest flux were observed when nitrate wa added to the soil under high moisture condition . Dextrose ( C source ) addition increased flux at more extent in the soil from the pasture that received herbicide application and also displayed higher N availability . With acetylene application it wa possible to observe that a large portion of N lost in gaseous form occurs a N-2 . Thus , in the studied pasture the denitrification process appeared to be dominated by N2O soil flux and N wa the main factor controlling these flux .

aVDifferences in regional response to climate fluctuation are well documented on short time scale ( e.g. , El Nino-Southern Oscillation ) , but with the exception of latitudinal temperature gradient , regional pattern are seldom considered in discussion of ancient greenhouse climate . Contrary to the expectation of global warming or global cooling implicit in most treatment of climate evolution over million of year , this paper show that the North Atlantic warmed by a much a 6 degree C ( 1.5 part per thousand decrease in delta ( 18 ) O value of planktic foraminifera ) during the Maastrichtian global cooling interval . We suggest that warming wa the result of the importation of heat from the South Atlantic . Decreasing North Atlantic delta ( 18 ) O value are also associated with increasing gradient in planktic delta ( 13 ) C value , suggesting increasing surface-water stratification and a correlated strengthening of the North Atlantic Polar Front . If correct , this conclusion predicts arctic cooling during the late Maastrichtian . Beyond implication for the Maastrichtian , these data demonstrate that climate doe not behave a if there is a simple global thermostat , even on geologic time scale .

aVLongitudinal correlation between the North Atlantic Oscillation large-scale weather system ( NAO ) and the annual incidence rate of 14 viral , bacterial and protozoan national notifiable human disease in the Czech Republic wa examined . In simple correlation , case of salmonellosis , erysipelas , infectious mononucleosis and toxoplasmosis were positively correlated with the winter NAO index , while hepatitis A and shigellosis were negatively correlated , and the other disease tested ( rubella , mumps , chickenpox. , tick-borne encephalitis , Lyme borreliosis , leptospirosis , tularemia and scarlet fever ) were uncorrelated with NAO . However , 8 of the 14 disease also revealed a significant time trend , either increasing ( infectious mononucleosis , salmonellosis , erysipelas , toxoplasmosis ) or decreasing ( hepatitis A , scarlet fever , leptospirosis , shigellosis ) during the period . When the effect of NAO on incidence of the disease wa then controlled for calendar year using partial correlation analysis and detrended regression , only toxoplasmosis and infectious mononucleosis were found significantly positively correlated with the NAO when the index wa lagged 1 or 2 year , and leptospirosis wa correlated negatively with a lag of 2 year . Large-scale weather change a described by NAO therefore do not seem to be a crucial factor in the fluctuation of annual incidence rate of the majority of tested infectious disease in the Czech Republic , while other factor , especially social and public health circumstance , are obviously more important .

aVDaily satellite cloud observation and reanalysis dynamical parameter are analyzed to determine how midtropospheric vertical velocity and advection over the sea surface temperature gradient control midlatitude North Pacific cloud property . Optically thick cloud with high top are generated by synoptic ascent , but two different cloud regime occur under synoptic descent . When vertical motion is downward during summer , extensive stratocumulus cloudiness is associated with near-surface northerly wind , while frequent cloudless pixel occur with southerly wind . Examination of ship-reported cloud type indicates that midlatitude stratocumulus break up a the boundary layer decouples when it is advected equatorward over warmer water . Cumulus is prevalent under condition of synoptic descent and cold advection during winter . Poleward advection of subtropical air over colder water cause stratification of the near-surface layer that inhibits upward mixing of moisture and suppresses cloudiness until a fog eventually form . Averaging of cloud and radiation data into interval of 500-hPa vertical velocity and advection over the SST gradient enables the cloud response to change in temperature and the stratification of the lower troposphere to be investigated independent of the dynamic . Vertically uniform warming result in decreased cloud amount and optical thickness over a large range of dynamical condition . Further calculation indicate that a decrease in the variance of vertical velocity would lead to a small decrease in mean cloud optical thickness and cloud-top height . These result suggest that reflection of solar radiation back to space by midlatitude oceanic cloud will decrease a a direct response to global warming , thus producing an overall positive feedback on the climate system . An additional decrease in solar reflection would occur were the storm track also to weaken , whereas an intensification of the storm track would partially cancel the cloud response to warming .

aVData for the 20th century from the International Comprehensive Ocean and Atmosphere Data Set and the Kobe Collection have been used a input data for global objective analysis of sea-surface temperature ( SSTs ) and other marine meteorological variable . This study seek a better understanding of the historical marine meteorological data and an evaluation of the quality of the data in the Kobe Collection . Objective analysis yield gridded data that are le noisy than observed data , which facilitates handling of historical data . The observed data determine the quality of the objective analysis , and quality control specified for historical data is incorporated into the objective analysis to reduce artificial error . The objective analysis are based on optimum interpolation and reconstruction with empirical orthogonal function . The final database produced in this study not only contains analysed value , but also analysis error and data distribution at each time step of the objective analysis . The analysis database contains ample information on historical observation , a well a signal of marine climate variation during the century . Time series of global mean marine temperature and cloud cover include trend linked to global warming , and local peak appear commonly in all the time series around the 1940s . Sea-level pressure and seasurface wind field show significant linear trend at high latitude and over the North Pacific Ocean respectively . These trend seem to be artificial . An SST analysis used widely in climatological study wa verified against HadISST from the Hadley Centre and an SST analysis derived from satellite and in situ observation . El Nino and southern oscillation index for the century are successfully reproduced , even though observation in the tropic are much rarer before 1950 than after 1950 .

aVThere ha been growing interest in Europe in the development of integrated transport strategy , in which individual policy instrument are combined to complement one another and to achieve improved performance against a given set of policy objective . This paper applies an optimization procedure to identify optimal strategy for package of transport policy instrument without , and then with , constraint on finance and target for global warming and safety . Some exploratory test have also been carried out on land use strategy , and they are reported here in brief . Results demonstrate that the methodology is robust and can be applied with different transport model and with constraint applied both to policy instrument and to objective . All optimal strategy found involved substantial reduction in fare level throughout the study area . Where it wa not possible to change fare , the strategy were substantially le effective when measured against the objective . Most optimal strategy involved increase in public transport frequency , although their scale varied between city . All optimal strategy included peak-period cordon charge to enter the city center , I hough the optimal level varied between city . Financially constrained strategy were found to involve smaller fare reduction and higher cordon charge ; in some case frequency increase were smaller . These constrained optimum still performed well ; the greatest reduction in benefit wa only 15 % . The net present value of the benefit generated wa about EURO2,000M ( EURO1 = $ 1.20 US , 2005 ) in Edinburgh and more than EURO4,000M in Leeds , United Kingdom . The impact of transport strategy on land use wa small , and development constraint had to be used to reverse urban sprawl .

aVGreenhouse gas such a CO2 is the primary cause of global warming . Alternative energy source should be provided without producing more CO2 , such a solar energy . One of the best route to remedy CO2 is to transform it to hydrocarbon using photo reduction . In our study , CO2 wa photocatalytically reduced to produce methanol using a Hg lamp with wavelength 365 nm in a steady-state optical-fiber photo reactor . The optical-fiber photo reactor , comprised of near 120 Cu/TiO2-coated fiber , wa designed and assembled to transmit and spread light uniformly inside reactor . TiO2 film wa coated on optical fiber using dip-coating method . Titania and Cu-loaded solution were prepared by a thermal hydrolysis method . The thickness of Cu/TiO2 film wa 53 nm and consisted of very . ne spherical particle with diameter of near 14 nm . The XRD spectrum indicated the anatase phase of all TiO2 and Cu/ TiO2 film . The wavelength of absorption edge wa on 367 nm , equivalent to near 3.3 eV . Most active Cu specie on TiO2 surface were Cu2O cluster , and played an important role for the formation of methanol . The methanol yield increased with UV irradiative intensity . Photo activity increased with increasing Cu loading . Maximum methanol rate wa 0.45 mu mole/g-cat center dot hr using 1.2 wt % - Cu/TiO2 catalyst under 16W/cm ( 2 ) irradiation , 1.3 bar pressure of CO2 , and 5000 second mean residence time . Higher than 1.2 wt % Cu loading gave le rate of methanol yield because of the masking effect of Cu2O cluster on the surface of TiO2 .

aVThe effect of UV-B radiation on 2 ciliate specie ( Glaucoma sp . and Cyclidium sp . ) from a clear oligotrophic lake were examined under laboratory condition with and without photoreactivating radiation ( PRR : UV-A and visible light ) . Glaucoma sp . wa exposed to 3 UV-B intensity at 4 temperature to simulate a range of environmentally relevant condition . Population growth of Glaucoma sp . declined with increasing level of UV-B exposure in treatment receiving PRR ; blocking PRR generally resulted in 100 % mortality . Occurrence of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer ( CPDs [ mb DNA ] ( -1 ) ) wa significantly reduced in Glaucoma sp . receiving PRR relative to those without PRR . These data indicate that photoenzymatic repair is a major component of UV-B tolerance in Glaucoma . At UV-B level that Glaucoma sp . tolerated , Cyclidium sp . suffered 100 % mortality and accumulated a similar level of CPDs whether or not PRR wa blocked . Incubation of the 2 ciliate under UV-transparent and UV-blocking acrylic in the oligotrophic lake confirmed their relative sensitivity to UV radiation ( UVR ) . Photoenzymatic repair in Glaucoma sp . wa more efficient at 20 degree C than at 10 , 15 and 25 degree C. The temperature-dependent nature of photoenzymatic repair underscore the need to consider the interactive effect of temperature and UVR on biota , particularly in the face of global climate change and rising incident UVR due to ozone depletion .

aVTop pelagic predator such a tuna , shark , marine turtle and mammal have historically been difficult to study due to their large body size and vast range over the oceanic habitat . In recent year the development of small microprocessor-based data storage tag that are surgically implanted or satellite-linked provide marine researcher a novel avenue for examining the movement , physiology and behavior of pelagic animal in the wild . When biological and physical data obtained from the tag are combined with satellite derived sea surface temperature and ocean color data , the relationship between the movement , behavior and physical ocean environment can be examined . Tag-bearing marine animal can function a autonomous ocean profilers providing oceanographic data wherever their long migration take them . The biologging science is providing ecological physiologist with new insight into the seasonal movement , habitat utilization , breeding behavior and population structure in of marine vertebrate . In addition , the data are revealing migration corridor , hot spot and physical oceanographic pattern that are key to understanding how organism such a bluefin tuna use the open ocean environment . In the 21st century a ecosystem degradation and global warming continue to threaten the existence of specie on Earth , the field of physiological ecology will play a more pivotal role in conservation biology .

aVCurrent concern for the future of reindeer and caribou ( Rangifer tarandus ) in the far north under condition of global warming focus on the increased energetic and predation cost associated with warmer winter and on vegetation change and increased insect harassment caused by warmer summer . At the Grotte XVI archaeological site ( Dordogne , southwestern France ) , episode of summer warming between about 36,000 and 12,000 radiocarbon year ago appear to be associated with lowered relative abundance of reindeer . As the Pleistocene ended and summer temperature climbed higher , reindeer were extirpated from southern France . A similar phenomenon appears to have occurred here during the prior Eemian interglacial . These record suggest that increased summer temperature under condition of global warming may have a direct negative effect on reindeer and caribou population , including a northward displacement of their southern distributional boundary .

aVMid to late 20th century expansion of Dracophyllum scrub into tussock grassland on subantarctic Campbell Island ha been attributed to the collective effect of global warming , cessation of farming in 1931 , and continued grazing by feral sheep . To determine the importance of these , we dated the timing of scrub expansion by aging 241 Dracophyllum plant in 17 plot chosen to sample the range of environment this shrub/ small tree occupies on Campbell Island . Three plot , in lowland , well-drained , location were dominated by large , old Dracophyllum that had established between 1846 and 1940 . Virtually all shrub in the remaining plot had established after 1940 , with peak in 1970 and 1985 . The pattern of establishment doe not coincide with any marked change in the temperature regime , although a prolonged period of relatively dry winter ( c. 1970-1990 ) coincides with a late surge of regeneration on very wet site . The removal of feral sheep from different part of the island at different time is also unrelated to the pattern of establishment . In contrast , Dracophyllum spread follows farm abandonment in 1931 when regular burning ceased , suggesting that Dracophyllum is invading site from which it wa excluded by fire . However , the earliest report from the mid 19th century indicate that tussock grassland wa previously the dominant vegetation cover on the island , with limited Dracophyllum scrub . It is possible that the reduction of the dense tussock grassland by fire and grazing in late 19th-early 20th century opened a regeneration window for Dracophyllum scrub to spread once burning ceased .

aVThis study report on an examination of the potential effect of global warming on a water resource system in Korea . Assuming a doubling in CO2 concentration ( denoted 2CO ( 2 ) ) , basin-scale scenario for precipitation and other hydrometeorologic variable were generated from the existing general circulation model ( GCM ) result . The generated temperature and precipitation scenario were input to the NWS-PC model to generate the corresponding streamflow scenario over the Geum river basin . A reservoir simulation model for Daecheong Dam in the Geum river basin ha been developed using the object-oriented simulation environment , STELLA . For each streamflow scenario , the performance of the reservoir wa assessed in term of reliability , resiliency , and vulnerability . Although the simulation result are heavily dependent on the choice of climate change scenario , the following conclusion can be made : the future streamflow over Daecheong Dam tends to decrease during the dry period , which seriously increase competitive water use issue ; and flood control issue predominate under the 2CO ( 2 ) -High case .

aVThe red imported fire ant , Solenopsis invicta Buren , is an invasive pest from South America that currently occupies much of the south-eastern USA . Global warming is likely to allow range expansion of many invasive specie , including S. invicta . We used a dynamic , ecophysiological model of fire ant colony growth coupled with model simulating climate change to predict the potential range expansion of S. invicta in the eastern USA over the next century . The climate change scenario predicted by the Vegetation-Ecosystem Modelling and Analysis Project ( VEMAP ) wa used in our analysis . Our prediction indicate that the habitable area for S. invicta may increase by c. 5 % over the next 40-50 year ( a northward expansion of 33 +/- 35 km ) . As the pace of global warming is expected to quicken in the latter half of the century , however , the habitable area for S. invicta in 2100 is predicted to be > 21 % greater than it currently is ( a northward expansion of 133 +/- 68 km ) . Because the black imported fire ant , S. richteri Forel , occupies higher latitude than S. invicta , the overall area of the eastern USA infested with invasive Solenopsis specie could be greater than that estimated here .

aVAim The conservation of biological and genetic diversity is a major goal of reserve system at local , regional , and national level . The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources suggests a 12 % threshold ( area basis ) for adequate protection of biological and genetic diversity of a plant community . However , threshold based on area may protect only a small portion of the total diversity if the location are chosen without regard to the variation within the community . The objective of this study were to demonstrate method to apply a coarse-filter approach for identifying gap in the current reserve system of the Psuedotsuga menziesii ( Douglas-fir ) forest type group based on current climatic condition and a global climate change scenario . Location Western United States . Method We used an ecological envelope approach that wa based on seven bioclimatic factor , two topographic factor , and two edaphic factor . Multivariate factor analysis wa then used to reduce the envelope to two dimension . The relative density of habitat and protected area were identified in each part of the envelope based on the current climate and potential future climate . We used this information to identify gap in the reserve system . Results Although the protected area occurred in all part of the envelope , most existed in colder and drier area . This wa true for both the current climate and potential future climate . Main conclusion To protect more of the ecological envelope , future conservation effort would be most effective in western Oregon , north-western Washington , and north-western California .

aVThe long-term adjustment process of atmosphere and ocean in response to gradually increased atmospheric CO2 concentration have been analyzed in 70 and 140 a integration with NCAR fully-coupled climate system model ( CSM ) . In these experiment the CO2 concentration ha been increased to double and quadruple the initial concentration , respectively . After 70 a , at the time of CO2 doubling , the model predicts surface air temperature rise by 1.2 and 1.5 K for the globe and the northwestern Pacific Ocean , respectively . The behavior of the quadrupling run is similar : each global and regional mean surface air temperature increase by 2.8 and 3.0 K at the time of CO2 quadrupling . From the experiment , surface air temperature change in the northwestern Pacific Ocean will be more distinctive compared with the global average , mainly due to exceptionally large warming and sea level change near the entrance of the Kuroshio extension .

aVIntegration of data from ichnological and other interdisciplinary source from the Quaternary Banas River Basin ( India ) ha permitted the reconstruction of a composite ichnofacies model for the interpretation of paleoenvironments and paleosealevels . A glacioeustatic transgressive-regressive system tract of the ancient Arabian Sea ha been recognized from the superposition of ichnofacies . The Pleistocene shallow marine Psilonichnus ichnofacies ( ichnogenus Psilonichnus , Skolithos , Arenicolites and Thalassinoides of infaunal polychaete , crab and bivalve origin ) , developed in the Vadpag-Vend segment of the lower Banas sequence , corresponds to interglacial high sea stand . The overlying late Pleistocene-Holocene continental Coprinisphaera-Scoyenia mixed ichnofacies ( paleosol association of delicate surficial trace of terrestrial insect and river floodplain association of aquatic trace of worm and crustacean ) , formed in the Radhanpur-Varahi segment of the upper Banas sequence , represents the Last Glacial regressive mode of scalevel . Levee-bound oriented crustacean burrow may be used a new ichnological tool to locate buried paleochannels and aquifer . The juxtaposition of levee with alternate worm burrow and barren zone and floodplain with gastropod and barren zone indicates monsoonal low and high in the Holocene . The overprinting of the Coprinisphaera element on the Scoyenia form ha resulted from the Recent-sub-Recent environmental degradation ( rising temperature , spread of desert , shrinking saltmarshes and weakened fluvial force ) probably related to global warming and other Greenhouse process . The readable ichnological signature of the Quaternary glacioeustatic sealevel fluctuation and consequent climatic change qualify the Banas model for wider application .

aVThe sensitivity of the global climate is essentially determined by the radiative damping of the global mean surface temperature anomaly through the outgoing radiation from the top of the atmosphere ( TOA ) . Using the TOA flux of terrestrial and reflected solar radiation obtained from the Earth radiation budget experiment ( ERBE ) , this study estimate the magnitude of the overall feedback , which modifies the radiative damping of the annual variation of the global mean surface temperature , and compare it with model simulation . Although the pattern of the annually varying anomaly is quite different from that of the global warming , the analysis conducted here may be used for assessing the systematic bias of the feedback that operates on the CO2-induced warming of the surface temperature . In the absence of feedback effect , the outgoing terrestrial radiation at the TOA is approximately follows the Stefan-Boltzmann 's fourth power of the planetary emission temperature . However , it deviate significantly from the blackbody radiation due to various feedback involving water vapor and cloud cover . In addition , the reflected solar radiation is altered by the feedback involving sea ice , snow and cloud , thereby affecting the radiative damping of surface temperature . The analysis of ERBE reveals that the radiative damping is weakened by a much a 70 % due to the overall effect of feedback , and is only 30 % of what is expected for the blackbody with the planetary emission temperature . Similar feedback analysis is conducted for three general circulation model of the atmosphere , which wa used for the study of cloud feedback in the preceding study . The sign and magnitude of the overall feedback in the three model are similar to those of the observed . However , when it is subdivided into solar and terrestrial component , they are quite different from the observation mainly due to the failure of the model to simulate individually the solar and terrestrial component of the cloud feedback . It is therefore desirable to make the similar comparison not only for the overall feedback but also for it individual component such a albedo- and cloud-feedbacks . Although the pattern of the annually-varying anomaly is quite different from that of global warming , the methodology of the comparative analysis presented here may be used for the identification of the systematic bias of the overall feedback in a model . A proposal is made for the estimation of the best guess value of climate sensitivity using the output from many climate model submitted to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .

aVThe global warming trend of the latest Oligocene wa interrupted by several cooling event associated with Antarctic glaciation . These cooling event affected surface water productivity and plankton assemblage . Well-preserved radiolarian were obtained from upper Oligocene to lower Miocene sediment at Ocean Drilling Program ( ODP ) Leg 199 Sites 1218 and 1219 in the equatorial Pacific , and 110 radiolarian specie were identified . Four episode of significant radiolarian faunal change were identified : middle late Oligocene ( 27.5 to 27.3 Ma ) , latest Oligocene ( 24.4 Ma ) , earliest Miocene ( 23.3 Ma ) , and middle early Miocene ( 21.6 Ma ) . These four episode approximately coincide with increase and decrease of biogenic silica accumulation rate and increase in 6180 value coded a `` Oi '' and `` Mi '' event . These data indicate that Antarctic glaciation were associated with change of siliceous sedimentation pattern and faunal change in the equatorial Pacific . Radiolarian fauna wa divided into three assemblage based on variation in radiolarian productivity , specie richness and the composition of dominant specie : a late Oligocene assemblage ( 27.6 to 24.4 Ma ) , a transitional assemblage ( 24.4 to 23.3 Ma ) and an early Miocene assemblage ( 23.3 to 21.2 Ma ) . The late Oligocene assemblage is characterized by relatively high productivity , low specie richness and four dominant specie of Tholospyris anthophora , Stichocorys subligata , Lophocyrtis noma and Lithelius spp . The transitional assemblage represents relatively low value of productivity and specie richness , and consists of three dominant specie of T anthophora , S. subligata and L. noma . The characteristic of the early Miocene assemblage are relatively low productivity , but high specie richness . The two dominant specie present in this assemblage are T anthophora and Cyrtocapsella tetrapera . The most significant faunal turnover of radiolarian is marked at the boundary between the transitional/early Miocene assemblage . We also reviewed change in other microfossil assemblage in the low latitude during the late Oligocene through early Miocene . The microfossil assemblage of major group show sequential change near the Oligocene/Miocene ( O/M ) boundary ( 23.8 Ma ) . Many extinction event and some first occurences of calcareous nannofossils and many occurrence of radiolarian are found from about 24.8 to 23.3 Ma , and first occurrence of planktic foraminifer and diatom followed from 23.2 through 22 Ma . Hence , the ON boundary is identified a a significant level for microfossil evolution . ( c ) 2005 Elsevier B.V All right reserved .

aVTemperature change over Greenland are of special interest due to a possible melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet and resulting sea level rise . General Circulation Models ( GCMs ) predict that the temperature change in Greenland should proceed at a faster rate than the global temperature change . Until now there ha been no confirmation that Greenland 's long- term temperature change are related to the global warming and that they proceed faster than the global temperature change . Using double correlation between the Greenland temperature record , North Atlantic Oscillation ( NAO ) index and global temperature change we find a region of Greenland that is not affected by the NAO . Using this region a an indicator of Greenland 's temperature change that is related to global warming , we find that the ratio of the Greenland to global temperature change due to global warming is 2.2 in broad agreement with GCM prediction .

aVFraser fir ( Abies fraseri ( Pursh ) Poiret ) is an endemic , high-elevation conifer confined to six relict mountain-top community in the southern Appalachian Mountains , USA . High adult mortality ha occurred over the past 50 year , possibly the result of an introduced insect ( Adelges piceae Ratzeburg ) , air pollution , or both . Knowledge of the mechanism of and limitation to seedling establishment may allow reestablisment and perpetuation of this unique community type , notwithstanding global climate change . We monitored seedling emergence and mortality in relation to photosynthetic performance and water relation in microsites differing in canopy openness ( sunlight exposure ) over the summer of 2004 . Abundance of cotyledonous seedling in early summer wa 2.3 time greater ( 849 versus 366 seedling m ( -2 ) ) in microsites with lower sky exposure ( greater canopy closure ) than in microsites with greater sky exposure ( greater canopy openness ) . In contrast , late-season abundance and survival were greater in area beneath more open canopy than in area beneath le open canopy ( 3.3 time and 11.7 time greater , respectively ) . However , newly emerged seedling survival in a completely open site ( no overhead canopy ) wa zero , despite an initial density of 124 seedling m ( -2 ) . Seedling water status wa similar in open- and closed-canopy site ( -0.52 and -0.74 MPa , respectively ) . Photosynthetic carbon gain wa higher in newly emerged seedling at open canopy than at closed canopy site , especially during early morning . Based on photosynthetic light response curve and measured sunlight regime , seedling in open canopy site were estimated to assimilate 3.3-4.5 time more carbon than seedling at closed site . Reductions in carbon gain of closed-site seedling , primarily a result of limited sunlight , corresponded to substantial increase in seedling mortality ( 98 versus 79 % in open canopy site ) . Thus , sunlight exposure , which reflects overstory canopy structure , appears to be an important factor influencing newly emerged seedling survival and distribution .

aVWood is a prospective material against the problem of mineral resource shortage and global warming from the viewpoint of sustainable development . The continuous cycle of felling , planting and growing of tree is essential prerequisite for sustainability . The engineering evaluation of advantage of wood can increase it use more widely a a substitute for other industrial material and save the finite mineral resource . The increase of wood use can support the continuous cycle for the sustainable forestry a an industry . This paper treat good tactile warmth of wood a one of it advantage . The relationship between contact surface temperature and thermal effusivity is derived from the theoretical analysis of governing heat transfer phenomenon on tactile warmth . Some knowledge on tactile warmth of wood is reviewed with these physical property . The sensory tactile warmth of wood ha a high and positive linear correlation with the logarithm of the contact surface temperature . The material with lower thermal effusivity feel warmer than the one with higher thermal effusivity . The relationship between contact surface temperature and thermal effusivity explains rationally why each wood ha a large difference of tactile warmth in spite of their small difference of material property . It also explains the reason why wood ha good tactile warmth regardless of season against metal , which feel too hot in summer and too cold in winter to touch . The contact surface temperature and the thermal effusivity are proposed a engineering measure to evaluate the tactile warmth of wood and other material . ( c ) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aV1 . Oligotrophic Arctic stream are likely to be sensitive to change in hydrology and nutrient input predicted to occur a a consequence of future climate and land use change . To investigate the potential consequence of nutrient enrichment for low-order Arctic stream , we added ammonium-N and phosphorous to a second-order beaded , tundra stream on Alaska 's north slope . We measured response in nutrient chemistry , chlorophyll a standing crop , and in the breakdown and macroinvertebrate colonisation of leaf litter over a 38-day summer period . 2 . During the addition , nutrient concentration immediately downstream of the dripper averaged 6.4 mum ammonium-N and 0.45 muM soluble reactive P. Concentrations upstream of the dripper averaged 0.54 muM ammonium-N and 0.03 muM soluble reactive P. Uptake of both nutrient wa rapid . Concentrations were reduced on average to 28 % ( ammonium-N ) and 15 % ( inorganic P ) of maximum value within 1500 m. Standing crop of chlorophyll a on standardised sampler were significantly higher by the end of the experiment . Breakdown rate of senescent willow ( Salix sp . ) and sedge ( Carex sp . ) litter and associated fungal biomass were also significantly increased by nutrient addition . 3 . Fertilisation resulted in four- to sevenfold higher macroinvertebrate abundance and two-to fourfold higher macroinvertebrate biomass in litter bag , a well a an increase in late-summer body mass of larval Nemoura stonefly . 4 . Our result are consistent with those of similar study of larger stream in the high-Arctic region . Based on our short-term experiment , increased input of nutrient into these ecosystem , whether caused by climate change or more local disturbance , are likely to have profound ecological consequence . Longer-term effect of enrichment , and their interaction with other component of future change in climate or land use , are more difficult to ass .

aVGlobal warming is expected to increase nocturnal environmental temperature . We determined bow elevated nocturnal versus diurnal temperature alter fitness component in the imported cabbageworm ( Pieris rapae L. ) . Full-sib family of P. rapae caterpillar were split into control , increased nocturnal , and increased diurnal temperature treatment . We found significant variation among family for relative growth rate , development rate , and pupal mass . Some family had a positive cot-relation between pupal mass and development rate , whereas others had a negative correlation . On average , we found a faster development rate caused by the nocturnal treatment and a smaller pupal mass caused by the nocturnal and diurnal temperature treatment . We found no significant effect of the temperature treatment on relative growth rate . An exponential growth model suggests that , despite the decreased pupal mass associated with the increased nocturnal temperature regimen , the faster development rate would cause the nocturnal population to multiply more quickly than the control or diurnal population .

aVIn a previously reported study . wind tunnel experiment were undertaken to investigate the aerodynamic characteristic of hybrid-sails in isolation . Such sail are seen a providing a worthwhile reduction in the delivered power to the propeller and hence the engine generated thrust , with a corresponding reduction in the CO2 production of diesel engine exhaust . In this paper , wind tunnel testing is used to investigate sail-sail interaction effect for two set of four identical hybrid-sails , and the sail-hull interaction effect for the same two set of four identical sail in the presence of a bulk carrier hullform . The analysis presented suggests that to build a sail-assisted ship requires an appreciation of the sail-sail and sail-hull interaction effect .

aVIn order to ass the ecological sustainability of agricultural production system , there is a need for effective tool . We describe an environmental system analysis tool called SALSA ( Systems Analysis for Sustainable Agriculture ) . It consists of substance/material flow model in which the simulation result are interpreted with lifecycle assessment methodology . The application of SALSA is demonstrated in a case study in which three different way of producing pig are compared with respect to energy input and the environmental impact of global warming , eutrophication , and acidification . The scenario that combined a low-protein diet without soy meal with an improved manure-management technique with low nitrogen loss wa the best for all impact category studied . The strength of the SALSA model wa their capacity to capture consequence of management option that had an influence on several process on a farm , which enabled the type of complex study we describe .

aVAustralia is a land of salt lake and despite low human population density , many lake are adversely impacted by a range of factor . Secondary salinisation is the most pernicious force degrading lake , especially in south-west Western Australia where up to 30 % of the landscape is predicted to be affected . Mining also impinges on many salt lake in this state , mainly through the dewatering of saline groundwater . Exploitation of groundwater for irrigation caused some lake in Victoria , Australia , to dry , especially the significant Red Rock Complex . Global climate change will result in new water balance in endorheic lake , with most having le water , particularly the seasonal lake of southern Australia . This ha already happened in Lake Corangamite , Victoria , but the prime reason is diversion of inflowing floodwater . Consequently , the lake ha retreated and become salinised compromising it status a a Ramsar site . Various other lake suffer from enhanced sedimentation , have introduced biota or their catchment are being disturbed to their detriment . Enlightened management should be able to maintain some important lake in an acceptable condition , but , for most others , the future is bleak .

aVBased on the result of long-term flux measurement at two paddy flux site , Mase ( MSE ) in central Japan and Hachihama ( HCH ) in western Japan , we present seasonal variation of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) and methane ( CH4 ) exchange between single rice cropping paddy field and the atmosphere in 2003 . CO2 flux wa measured by the eddy covariance method at the two site , while CH4 flux wa measured at MSE site by the modified aerodynamic method . Net ecosystem CO2 exchange ( NEE ) in the 2003 growing period showed a distinct seasonal variation with rice growth , and reached the maximum daily CO2 uptake of 9.2-9.5 g C m ( -2 ) d ( -1 ) in the middle growing period . The total NEE in the growing period at HCH site wa more negative than that at MSE site by 84 g C m ( -2 ) , 60 % of which wa caused by larger gross primary production ( GPP ) and the remainder by smaller ecosystem respiration ( RE ) at HCH site . The inter-site difference in GPP wa principally caused by larger amount of incident photosynthetically active radiation at HCH site , which resulted from longer cultivation period at HCH site and shorter sunshine duration at MSE site in the mid-growing period . The inter-site difference in RE wa attributed to that the rice growth at HCH site wa out of phase with the seasonal variation of temperature . By including NEE in the non-growing period , we estimated the annual NEE at MSE site at a range between -192 and -284 g C m ( -2 ) . CH4 emission flux at MSE site increased with day after flooding , and showed a flush of CH4 after the pre-harvest drainage . The amount of CH4 emission during the 2003 growing period wa 9.3 g C m ( -2 ) , which wa negligible in the carbon budget of the paddy field when compared with the annual NEE , but it had significant influence on the greenhouse gas budget because of the large global warming potential of CH4 .

aVThe sensitivity of the ocean 's climate to the diapycnal diffusivity in the ocean is studied for a global warming scenario in which CO2 increase by 1 % yr ( -1 ) for 75 yr . The thermohaline circulation slows down for about 100 yr and recovers afterward , for any value of the diapycnal diffusivity . The rate of slowdown and of recovery , a well a the percentage recovery of the circulation at the end of 1000-yr integration , are variable , but a direct relation with the diapycnal diffusivity can not be found . At year 70 ( when CO2 ha doubled ) an increase of the diapycnal diffusivity from 0.1 to 1.0 cm ( 2 ) s ( -1 ) lead to a decrease in surface air temperature of about 0.4 K and an increase in sea level rise of about 4 cm . The steric height gradient is divided into thermal component and haline component . It appears that , in the first 60 yr of simulated global warming , temperature variation dominate the salinity one in weakly diffusive model , whereas the opposite occurs in strongly diffusive model . The analysis of the vertical heat balance reveals that deep-ocean heat uptake is due to reduced upward isopycnal diffusive flux and parameterized-eddy advective flux . Surface warming , induced by enhanced CO2 in the atmosphere , lead to a reduction of the isopycnal slope , which translates into a reduction of the above flux . The amount of reduction is directly related to the magnitude of the isopycnal diffusive flux and parameterized-eddy advective flux at equilibrium . These latter flux depend on the thickness of the thermocline at equilibrium and hence on the diapycnal diffusion . Thus , the increase of deep-ocean heat uptake with diapycnal diffusivity is an indirect effect that the latter parameter ha on the isopycnal diffusion and parameterized-eddy advection .

aVWave energy will have a key role in meeting renewable energy target en route to a low carbon economy . However , in common with other renewables , it may be sensitive to change in climate resulting from rising carbon emission . Changes in wind pattern are widely anticipated , and this will ultimately alter wave regime . Indeed , evidence indicates that wave height have been changing over the last 40 year , although there is no proven link to global warming . Changes in the wave climate will affect wave energy conversion . Where the resource is restricted , there may be reduction in energy export and , consequently , negative economic impact . On the other hand , increased storm activity will increase installation survival risk . Here a study is presented that , for the first time , indicates the sensitivity of wave energy production and economics to change in climate .

aVAim Despite the pervasive and well-documented effect of global warming on specie ' range in terrestrial taxon and system , the effect of sea surface warming ha been poorly studied in marine system . Here we analyse change in the southern endpoint of distribution of rocky intertidal specie ( gastropod and chiton ) along the Chilean coast , and trend in sea surface temperature ( SST ) , using data collected during the last half-century . Location South-eastern Pacific coast , between 18degrees20 ' S and 42degrees35 ' S. Methods Past southern endpoint of distribution were obtained for 10 intertidal specie from museum collection and literature review . Current endpoint are based on field sampling conducted between 1998 and 2000 . Changes in the position of southern endpoint were analysed individually for each specie , a well a for the entire assemblage of specie included in the analysis . SST record encompassing 51-57 year were obtained from five coastal station located between 18degrees and 36degrees S. Results and main conclusion Most specie ( eight of 10 ) did not show expansion of their southern endpoint . The proportion of specie expanding , contracting or maintaining their southern limit did not differ from chance expectation . On average , specie showed small ( 1degrees latitude ) , non-significant contraction , with low rate of decadal change ( 0.18degrees latitude per 10 year ) . This pattern can be explained by change in SST , which showed a weak warming trend ( and at some site even cooling ) along the Chilean coast during the last 57 year . Our result show that different regional warming trend occur , and suggest that generalization about poleward shift in specie range can not be made . However , our result support the hypothesis that temperature is a major determinant of specie range dynamic .

aVThe interannual variability of monthly mean January and July precipitation and it possible change due to global warming are assessed using a five-member ensemble of climate for the period 1871-2100 , simulated by the CSIRO Mark 2 global coupled atmosphere-ocean model . In the 1961-1990 climate , for much of the middle to high latitude the standard deviation of precipitation for both month is roughly proportional to the mean , with the coefficient of variation ( C ) typically 0.3-0.5 . The variability there is shown to be largely consistent with that from a first-order Markov chain model of the daily rainfall occurrence , with the distribution of wet-day amount approximated by a gamma distribution , Global distribution of Mark 2-based parameter of this stochastic model , commonly used in weather generator , are presented . In low latitude , however , the variability from the coupled model is typically double that anticipated by the stochastic model , a quantified by an 'overdispersion ratio . C often exceeds one at subtropical location , where rain is le frequent , but sometimes relatively heavy . The standard deviation of monthly mean precipitation S generally increase a the global model warms , with the global mean S in 2071-2100 in January ( July ) being 9.0 % ( 11.5 % ) larger than in 1961-1990 . Decreases in some subtropical location occur , particularly where mean precipitation decrease . The global pattern of overdispersion is largely unchanged , however , and the change in S can be related to those in the stochastic model parameter . Much of the increase in S is associated with increase in the scale parameter of the gamma distribution of wet-day amount . Changes in C , which is unaffected by this parameter , are generally small . Increases in C in several subtropical band and over northern midlatitude land in July are related to a decreased frequency of precipitation , and ( to a lesser degree ) change in the gamma shape parameter . Some potential application of the result to downscaling are discussed , and illustrated using observed rainfall from southeast Australia . ( c ) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVThis study highlight the assessment of snow and glacier cover for possible inference of global climate change impact in high mountain like the Himalaya . The test catchment of the River Tista lie in the Sikkim state of the Indian Himalayan region , with steep mountain crossing nearly all ecozones , from subtropical to glacial . River flow are highly fluctuating , especially during the peak rainy season and snowmelt period . Annual rainfall pattern are non-uniform and can cause large flood . Runoff and discharge downstream are highly dependent upon snow and glacier extent . The temporary storage of frozen water brings about a delay in seasonal runoff . Snow cover built up in the higher region during the winter month melt in the spring-summer-autumn cycle and contributes to groundwater recharge . A spatial baseline inventory of snow cover/glacier , the permanent snowline and it short-term temporal change in the remote high-mountain area have been analysed using multidate Indian Remote Sensing Satellite data of 1992 to 1997 . A geographic information system-based overlay ha led to inference on snow cover characteristic and the alignment , dimension , slope disposition , height of the snout and associated feature of each of the glacier . Snow and glacier recession are to be monitored in future on a long-term basis to derive correlation with climate-change parameter . Copyright ( c ) 2005 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd .

aVJanzen , H. H. 2005 . Soil carbon : A measure of ecosystem response in a changing world ? Can . J . Soil Sci . 85 : 467-480 . The global carbon ( C ) cycle is changing , a evident from abrupt increase in atmospheric CO2 . These change have sparked interest in agricultural soil a potential repository for excess atmospheric C. Our perspective-on soil C , therefore , ha shifted : once , we focused mainly on how soil C affected productivity within agroecosystems ; now we see also how C dynamic in agricultural soil exert influence far beyond the farm . We have long used soil C a an indicator of soil quality ; now we may want to use soil C also a a broader indicator of ecosystem response . To prompt further discussion , I offer some tentative thought about how we might use soil C a an indicator on a changing earth . They include : using soil C to measure change across time , not only across space ; devising more sensitive measure of soil C change ; quantifying soil C across four dimension ; measuring the nature of C , a well a it amount ; using soil C alongside other indicator ; finding better way of admitting our uncertainty ; establishing long-term site for our successor to measure soil C change ; and following flow of C past the farm fence . Recent worry about global warming have focused our attention on `` sequestering '' soil C to remove atmospheric CO2 . That aim may be worthy , but perhaps too narrow ; a broader goal might be to ensure the productivity , permanence , and health of our agroecosystems and adjacent environment - and use C storage a a measure of progress toward that goal .

aVAim To infer future change in the distribution of isolated relict tree population at the limit of a specie ' geographical range , a deep understanding of the regeneration niche and the spatial pattern of tree recruitment is needed . Location A relict Pinus uncinata population located at the south-western limit of distribution of the specie in the Iberian System of north-eastern Spain . Methods Pinus uncinata individual were mapped within a 50 x 40-m plot , and their size , age and reproductive status were estimated . Data on seed dispersal were obtained from a seed-release experiment . The regeneration niche of the specie wa assessed based on the association of seedling density with substrate and understorey cover . The spatial pattern of seedling wa described using point-pattern ( Ripley 's K ) and surface-pattern ( correlograms , Moran 's I ) analysis . Statistical and inverse modelling were used to characterize seedling clustering . Results Pine seedling appeared aggregated in 6-m patch . Inverse modelling estimated a longer mean dispersal distance ( 27 m ) , which corresponded to the size of a large cluster along the north to north-eastward direction paralleled by an eastward trend of increasing seedling age . The two spatial scale of recruitment were related to two dispersal process . The small-scale clustering of seedling wa due to local seed dispersal in open area near the edge of Calluna vulgaris mat : the regeneration niche . The long-range expansion might be caused by le frequent medium-distance dispersal event due to the dominant north-westerly wind . Main conclusion To understand future range shift of marginal tree population , data on seed dispersal , regeneration niche and spatial pattern of recruitment at local scale should be obtained . The monitoring of understorey community should be a priority in order to predict correctly shift in tree specie range in response to global warming .

aVLittle is known about the process regulating specie richness in deep-sea community . Here we take advantage of natural experiment involving climate change to test whether prediction of the species-energy hypothesis hold in the deep sea . In addition , we test for the relationship between temperature and specie richness predicted by a recent model based on biochemical kinetics of metabolism . Using the deep-sea fossil record of benthic foraminifera and statistical meta-analyses of temperature-richness and productivity-richness relationship in 10 deep-sea core , we show that temperature but not productivity is a significant predictor of specie richness over the past c. 130 000 year . Our result not only show that the temperature-richness relationship in the deep-sea is remarkably similar to that found in terrestrial and shallow marine habitat , but also that specie richness track temperature change over geological time , at least on scale of c. 100 000 year . Thus , predicting biotic response to global climate change in the deep sea would require better understanding of how temperature regulates the occurrence and geographical range of specie .

aVAcademic and political debate over long-run climate policy often invoke `` stabilization '' of atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gas ( GHGs ) , but only rarely are non-CO2 greenhouse gas addressed explicitly . Even though the majority of short-term climate policy propose trading between gas on a global warming potential ( GWP ) basis , discussion of whether CO2 concentration should be 450 , 550 , 650 or perhaps a much a 750 ppm leave unstated whether there should be no additional forcing from other GHGs beyond current level or whether separate concentration target should be established for each GHG . Here , we use an integrated modeling framework to examine multi-gas stabilization in term of temperature , economic cost , carbon uptake and other important consequence . We show that there are significant difference in both cost and climate impact between different `` GWP equivalent '' policy and demonstrate the importance of non-CO2 GHG reduction on timescales of up to several century .

aVState-space model were applied to several climate index associated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) , including the Southern Oscillation Index ( SOI ) and it component sea level pressure series ; the NINO3 sea surface temperature index ; and the Northern Oscillation Index ( NOI ) . The best model for each series include a significant long-term nonparametric trend combined with a stochastic stationary cyclic term that clearly delineates the El Nino and La Nina event . There is no evidence that the frequency of ENSO event ha changed over the 20th century . The long-term trend , however , ha contributed to an apparent increase in the magnitude of recent El Nino event . This trend , potentially related to global warming , ha increased the level of each series by an amount equal to 30-50 % of the amplitude of their corresponding annual cycle or cyclic ENSO term . Thus , the background sea surface temperature in the eastern equatorial Pacific is more than 0.5 degree C warmer now than prior to 1950 , implying a greater overall impact of El Nino event .

aVThe purpose of this study is to discus the participation of Brazilian air transportation within the context of global climate change . It first briefly present an inventory of CO : ! emission caused by airborne activity in Brazil and then show a trend projection through to 2023 , indicating the progress of these emission , with eight possible mitigation strategy . The abatement potential for each of these strategy is also investigated . It is estimated that joint implementation of all these strategy within a typical projection of broad based sustainability ( based on renewable energy source with fair social. , economic and technological development ) could result in an annual reduction in CO2 emission caused by airborne activity in Brazil up to 28.5 % ( compared to the trend projection for 2023 ) . It is also estimated that the emission avoided through joint implementation of the mitigation alternative analyzed may well reach 82,000 Gg ( or 10 ( 9 ) g ) of CO2 from 2003 through 2023 .

aVThe retreat of glacier in Iceland due to climate warming during the last century ha resulted in changed hydrological condition at glacial margin and in larger sandy area . Subsequently , aeolian process have become more active . The aim of this research wa to study wind erosion south of Langjokull glacier and the development of encroaching sand , a well a the influence of macro and micro topography on the process . Automatic instrument and aeolian dust trap were used to monitor wind erosion and to estimate it dependence on surface roughness . Digital elevation model wa used to analyse the effect of macro topography on sand encroachment . The study indicates that large quantity of sand have moved southward from the glacial moraine and drained lake . The spatial distribution of the sand confirms a dominating aeolian transportation by northerly dry wind . The topography influence wind direction and the flux of aeolian material . Threshold velocity ( wind speed measured at 2m height ) ranged from 6.2ms ( -1 ) on level land to 10.7ms ( -1 ) on rough surface . Flux can exceed 1000kg m ( -1 ) hr ( -1 ) at 17 m s ( -1 ) wind speed . Slopes exceeding 7 per cent reduce or halt sand movement . Rough surface immobilize the aeolian material until accumulated material ha leveled the surface , after that the flux continues . The intensified aeolian process have buried previously vegetated area and it is likely that continued glacier retreat due to climate warming will cause further land degradation in this area .

aVThis article describes the policy decision-support tool , FAIR , to ass the environmental and abatement cost implication of international regime for differentiation of future commitment . The model link long-term climate target and global reduction objective with regional emission allowance and abatement cost , accounting for the Kyoto Mechanisms used . FAIR consists of three sub-models : a simple climate model , an emission-allocation model and a cost model . The article also analysis ten different rule-based emission allocation scheme for two long-term concentration stabilisation target for greenhouse gas . This analysis show that evaluating regime requires not only an assessment of the initial allocation , but also of the distribution of abatement cost and the impact from emission trading . The Multi-Stage approach ( with a gradual increase of Parties adopting emission intensity or reduction target ) and the Triptych approach ( with sectoral target for all Parties ) seem to provide the best prospect for most of the Parties when compared to the other allocation scheme analysed .

aVIn March 2004 the first-ever reported hurricane in the South Atlantic hit southern Brazil . Here we show that Catarina initiated a an extratropical cyclone in a frontal system , undergoing Tropical Transition two day later under persistent low vertical wind shear over near-average water temperature . The trajectory derived from an automatic tracking scheme showed a rare loop before the cyclone approached the coast for a second time . The vertical structure presented anticyclonic relative vorticity above and a small 300 hPa warm core embedded in a cold area . A mid-to-high latitude-blocking index showed that the five day before the genesis were in the 0.6 % first percentile of intensity considered over the last 25 year , followed by an unprecedented combination with low shear . The observed and predicted trend towards an increasingly positive phase of the Southern Annular Mode in global warming scenario could favor similar condition , increasing the probability of more Tropical Cyclones in the South Atlantic .

aVIn the past 300 million year , there ha been a near-perfect association between extinction event and the eruption of large igneous province , but proving the nature of the causal link is far from resolved . The associated environmental change often include global warming and the development of widespread oxygen-poor condition in the ocean . This implicates a role for volcanic CO2 emission , but other perturbation of the global carbon cycle , such a release of methane from gas hydrate reservoir or shut-down of photosynthesis in the ocean , are probably required to achieve severe green-house warming . The best link between extinction and eruption are seen in the interval from 300 to 150 Ma . With the exception of the Deccan Trap eruption ( 65 Ma ) , the emplacement of younger volcanic province ha been generally associated with significant environmental change but little or no increase in extinction rate above background level .

aVLac du Bourget , in the Alps , is the largest natural French lake . Following major restoration programme during the 1970s and early 1980s , involving massive effort to reduce nutrient load and pollution in the lake , the water quality ha improved over the past two decade . This can be inferred from the increase in the nitrate : phosphate ratio , the intensification of the `` clear-water phase '' ( i.e . the increase in the water column transparency in spring ) , and the reduction in the total phosphorus and chlorophyll a concentration . However , bloom of the filamentous , phycoerythrin-rich , non-nitrogen fixing and hepatotoxic cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens have occurred since 1996 and have been maintained subsequently , at least during summer and autumn period . Nutrients ( especially phosphorus ) are usually thought to be one of the most important factor responsible for cyanobacterial bloom , and so the question is asked if this bloom is a paradoxical outcome of the restoration program ? Using a large set of data taken from survey of Lac du Bourget , from the literature , and from recent laboratory experiment , and also using field data for the neighboring Lake Geneva , we propose a realistic scenario to account for the population dynamic of the cyanobacterium and the occurrence and maintenance of the bloom in Lac du Bourget . The characteristic of the lake ( high water column stability , deepening of the nutrient-depleted layer during the last decade , a long water residence time ) , local condition ( the nutrient load and charge ) and global change ( global warming ) all had to be taken into account to explain this bloom . We suggest that the success of P. rubescens in Lac du Bourget is probably due to increased transparency and a longer stratified period following ( 1 ) the restriction of other phytoplankton specie following reduced phosphorus , which ha allowed P. rubescens to make use of organic phosphorus to improve it competitiveness ; ( 2 ) warmer than average winter/spring period allowing an earlier water stratification and in fine a competitive advantage to P. rubescens ; ( 3 ) lower than average surface irradiance , which ha also given the low-light preferring P. rubescens an advantage . Finally , this study highlight the importance of long-term data set in attempting to elucidate the global cause of a major ecological problem ( such a this cyanobacterial bloom ) and impact with regard to the function and use of freshwater ecosystem .

aVUnderstanding the underlying mechanism that cause variation in survival and the reproductive success of animal is essential for predicting variation in population parameter . To gain an understanding of the effect of density and winter weather severity on white-tailed deer , Odocoileus virginianus ( Zimmermann , 1780 ) , we examined the effect of current-year deer density and cumulative weekly average value for snow depth , rainfall , and the number of degree below -15 degree C until the time of death , a well a cumulative effect of density and snow depth over the previous one and two winter , on the body condition of adult female , adult male , and fawn . Model selection using Akaike 's Information Criterion and multi-model inference suggested that snow depth wa the best predictor of body condition for all three age/sex group . Winter rainfall wa the next most influential predictor for adult female and adult male but wa not important in determining fawn body condition . Temperature had the least influence on the body condition of all three age/sex group . Deer density during the winter of death had minimal effect for all group and we found no evidence that cumulative multiyear variable influenced body condition . We hypothesize that cohort variation may better explain previous finding showing effect of multiyear variable . A model for estimating the proportion of animal in poor body condition for each age/sex group is presented .

aVReleases of halocarbon into the atmosphere over the last 50 year are among the factor that have contributed to change in the Earth 's climate since pre-industrial time . Their individual and collective potential to contribute directly to surface climate change is usually gauged through calculation of their radiative efficiency , radiative forcing , and/or Global Warming Potential ( GWP ) . For those halocarbon that contain chlorine and bromine , indirect effect on temperature via ozone layer depletion represent another way in which these gas affect climate . Further , halocarbon can also affect the temperature in the stratosphere . In this paper , we use a narrow-band radiative transfer model together with a range of climate model to examine the role of these gas on atmospheric temperature in the stratosphere and troposphere . We evaluate in detail the halocarbon contribution to temperature change at the tropical tropopause , and find that they have contributed a significant warming of similar to 0.4 K over the last 50 year , dominating the effect of the other well-mixed greenhouse gas at these level . The fact that observed tropical temperature have not warmed strongly suggests that other mechanism may be countering this effect . In a climate model this warming of the tropopause layer is found to lead to a 6 % smaller climate sensitivity for halocarbon on a globally averaged basis , compared to that for carbon dioxide change . Using recent observation together with scenario we also ass their past and predicted future direct and indirect role on the evolution of surface temperature . We find that the indirect effect of stratospheric ozone depletion could have offset up to approximately half of the predicted past increase in surface temperature that would otherwise have occurred a a result of the direct effect of halocarbon . However , a ozone will likely recover in the next few decade , a slightly faster rate of warming should be expected from the net effect of halocarbon , and we find that together halocarbon could bring forward next century 's expected warming by similar to 20 year if future emission projection are realized . In both the troposphere and stratosphere CFC-12 contributes most to the past temperature change and the emission projection considered suggest that HFC-134a could contribute most of the warming over the coming century .

aVWe live at a time when the global climate is experiencing unprecedented change . The realization that anthropogenically emitted greenhouse gas ( GHGs ) caused these change led to protracted international negotiation resulting in the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 . These negotia- tions were marred by political and economic overtone and the science of climate change wa largely sidelined by the US , the single largest GHG emitter which eventually withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol in 2001 . With Russia finally ratifying it , the Protocol came into force on 16 February 2005 . The Kyoto Protocol fix legally binding quantified emission limitation and reduction com- mitments ( QELRCs ) on the industrialized country , while exempting the developing and the least developed country from any emission restriction . The Clean Development Mechanism ( CDM ) is a market instrument under the Kyoto Protocol to help the industrialized country meet their QERLCs cost effectively while developing country can also benefit . The implication of CDM for carbon sink project in the country are briefly discussed .

aVA thorough analysis of the stability of the uncoupled Rooth interhemispheric three-box model of thermohaline circulation ( THC ) is presented . The model consists of a northern high-latitude box , a tropical box , and a southern high-latitude box , which correspond to the northern , tropical , and southern Atlantic Ocean , respectively . Restoring boundary condition are adopted for the temperature variable , and flux boundary condition are adopted for the salinity variable . This paper examines how the strength of THC change when the system undergoes forcings that are analogous to those of global warming condition by applying the equilibrium state perturbation to the moisture and heat flux into the three box . In each class of experiment , using suitably defined metric , the author determine the boundary dividing the set of forcing scenario that lead the system to equilibrium characterized by a THC pattern similar to the present one from those that drive the system to equilibrium with a reversed THC . Fast increase in the moisture flux into the northern high-latitude box are more effective than slow increase in leading the THC to a breakdown , while the increase of moisture flux into the southern high-latitude box strongly inhibit the breakdown and can prevent it . a in the case of slow increase in the Northern Hemisphere . High rate of heat flux increase in the Northern Hemisphere destabilize the system more effectively than low one increase in the heat flux in the Southern Hemisphere tend to stabilize the system .

aVA thorough analysis of the stability of a coupled version of an interhemispheric three-box model of thermohaline circulation ( THC ) is presented . This study follows a similarly structured analysis of an uncoupled version of the same model presented in Part I of this paper . The model consists of a northern high-latitude box , A tropical box , and a southern high-latitude box , which can be thought of a corresponding to the northern , tropical , and southern Atlantic Ocean , respectively . This paper examines how the strength of THC change when the system undergoes forcings ; representing global warming condition . Since a coupled model is used , a direct representation of the radiative forcing is possible because the main atmospheric physical process responsible for freshwater and heat flux are formulated separately . Each perturbation to the initial equilibrium is characterized by the total radiative forcing realized , by the rate of increase , and by the north-south asymmetry . Although only weakly asymmetric or symmetric radiative forcings are representative of physically reasonable condition , general asymmetric forcings are considered in order to get a more complete picture of the mathematical property of the system . The choice of suitably defined metric make it possible to determine the boundary dividing the set of radiative forcing scenario that lead the system to equilibrium characterized by a THC pattern similar to the present one , from those that drive the system to equilibrium where the THC is reversed . This paper also considers different choice for the atmospheric transport parameterizations and for the ratio between the high-latitude and tropical radiative forcing . It is generally found that fast forcings are more effective than slow forcings in disrupting the present THC pattern , forcings that are stronger in the northern box are also more effective in destabilizing the system , and very slow forcings do not destabilize the system whatever their asymmetry , unless the radiative forcings are very asymmetric and the atmospheric transport is a relatively weak function of the meridional temperature gradient . In this latter case some relevant hysteresis graph of the system are presented . The change in the strength of the THC are primarily forced by change in the latent heat transport in the hemisphere because of it sensitivity to temperature , which arises from the Clausius-Clapeyron relation .

aVAdult survival is thought to bean important factor regulating the size of aquatic insect population , yet very little is known about the factor that cause mortality during the adult stage . Percentage mortality over varying time interval and 96-h lethal temperature value ( 96-h ( dmax ) LT50 ) were calculated for the adult of the common New Zealand caddisfly Hydrobiosis parumbripennis McFarlane ( Hydrobiosidae ) and stonefly Zelandoperla decorata Tillyard ( Gripopterygidae ) , and 48-h ( dmax ) LT50 value were calculated for the leptophlebiid mayfly Acanthophlebia cruentata ( Hudson ) using an amplitude of diurnally varying temperature regimen within and outside the insect 's normal environmental range . Maxima ranged from 18 to 40 degree C and amplitude varied from 6 to 18 degree C. Mortality of adult mayfly and caddisflies were consistently higher than that of stonefly for all comparable diurnal temperature trial . Daily temperature maximum were more important than the diurnal range in regulating mortality , with a rapidly increasing mortality a temperature maximum exceeded 24 ( Acanthophlebia ) or 30 degree C ( H. parumbripennis and Z. decorata ) . Interpolated LT50 value for diurnally varying air temperature regimen were similar to 31-33 degree C for adult H. parumbripennis and Z. decorata and similar to 28-29 degree C for Acanthophlebia adult . The LT50 value for Z. decorata based on diurnally varying air temperature regimen wa approximate to 10 degree C higher than that for constant temperature regimen . These finding have potential implication for managing riparian zone alongside stream and also for predicting the impact of global warming on aquatic insect distribution .

aVThe solar radiation is the fundamental source of energy that drive the Earth 's climate and sustains life . The variability of this output certainly affect our planet . In the last two decade an enormous advance in the understanding of the variability of the solar irradiance ha been achieved . Space-based measurement indicate that the total solar irradiance change at various time scale , from minute to the solar cycle . Climate model show that total solar irradiance variation can account for a considerable part of the temperature variation of the Earth 's atmosphere in the pre-industrial era . During the 20th century it relative influence on the temperature change ha descended considerably . This mean that other source of solar activity a well a internal and man-made cause are contributing to the Earth 's temperature variability , particularly the former in the 20th century . Some very challenging question concerning total solar irradiance variation and climate have been raised : are total solar irradiance variation from cycle to cycle well represented by sunspot and facular change ? Does total solar irradiance variation always parallel the solar activity cycle ? Is there a long-term variation of the total solar irradiance , and closely related to this , is the total solar irradiance output of the quiet sun constant ? If there is not a long-term trend of total solar irradiance variation , then we need amplifying mechanism of total solar irradiance to account for the good correlation found between total solar irradiance and climate . The latter because the observed total solar irradiance change are inconsequential when introduced in present climate model . ( c ) 2005 COSPAR . Published by Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVTwo newly developed instrument were combined to analyze the trace metal content in size separated arctic aerosol during the measurement campaign ASTAR 2004 ( Arctic Study of Tropospheric Aerosols , Clouds and Radiation 2004 ) at Spitsbergen in May-June 2004 . The aim of this extensive aerosol measurement campaign wa to obtain a database for model-calculations of arctic aerosol , which play an important role in the global climate change . The ASTAR project wa centered on two aircraft measurement campaign , scheduled from 2004 to 2005 , addressing both aerosol and cloud measurement , combined with ground-based and satellite observation . In the present paper one example for the analysis of ground-based aerosol particle is described . The sampling of aerosol particle wa performed in a well-known manner by impaction of the particle on cleaned graphite target . By mean of a cascade impactor eight size class between 0.35 and 16.6 mu m aerodynamic diameter were separated . To analyze the metal content in the aerosol particle the target were rapidly heated up to 2700 degree C in an inductively heated vaporizer system ( IHVS ) . An argon flow transport the vaporized sample material into the inductively coupled plasma ( ICP ) used a ionization source for the time of flight-mass spectrometer ( TOF-MS ) . The simultaneous extraction of the ion from the plasma , a realized in the TOF instrument , allows to obtain the full mass spectrum of the sample during the vaporization pulse without any limitation in the number of element detected . With optimized experimental parameter the element content in arctic aerosol particle wa determined in a mass range between Li-7 and Bi-209 . Comparing the size distribution of the elemental content of the aerosol particle , two different meteorological situation were verified . For calibration acidified reference solution were placed on the cleaned target inside the IHVS . The limit of detection ( LOD ) for the element mass on the target range between 2 and 200 pg for the element studied , except Na , Mg , and Cr , which are influenced by high background .

aVIn addition to the six greenhouse gas included in the Kyoto Protocol , the tropospheric ozone precursor CO NMVOC and NO ( x ) and the aerosols/aerosol precursor black carbon , organic carbon and SO ( 2 ) also play significant role in climate change . The aim of this paper is to review some of the main scientific and political challenge associated with incorporating tropospheric ozone and aerosol precursor into climate agreement , and to discus how these challenge have a bearing on the design of future climate agreement . We argue that the optimal policy design for a particular substance depends on a combination of scientific and political concern . We look particularly at regional climate effect , negative forcing , metric ( measuring climate effect against other gas on a common scale ) . political attractiveness . and verification and compliance . We systematically review the existing knowledge on these issue . explore their impact on policy design . and conclude that , with current scientific knowledge . CO and NMVOC could conceivably be included in a global climate agreement . either in a basket , with the long-lived greenhouse gas or in a separate basket . while NO , and aerosol might be regulated more appropriately through regional agreement with link to a global agreement . However , the complexity and fairness implication of including tropospheric ozone precursor and aerosol might negatively affect the political feasibility of a future agreement .

aVVariability of subtropical cell ( STC ) overturning in the upper Pacific Ocean is examined in a coupled climate model in light of large observed change in STC transport . In a 1000-yr control run , modeled STC variation are smaller than observed , but correlate in a similar way with low-frequency ENSO-like variability . In model run that include anthropogenically forced climate change , STC pycnocline transport decrease progressively under the influence of global warming , attaining reduction of 8 % by 2000 and 46 % by 2100 . Although the former reduction is insufficient to fully account for the apparent observed decline in STC transport over recent decade , it doe suggest that global warming may have contributed to the observed change . Analysis of coupled model result show that STC transport play a significant role in modulating tropical Pacific Ocean heat content , and that such change are dominated by anomalous current advecting mean temperature , rather than by advection of temperature anomaly by mean current .

aVKarst in Shanxi Province is representative of that in northern China , and karst water system discharge in the form of spring that are among the most important source for local water supply . Since the 1950s , attenuation ha been the major trend of discharge variation of most karst spring at Shanxi . Based on the case study of 7 karst spring including Niangziguan , Xin'an , Guozhuang , Shentou , Jinci , Lancun , and Hongshan spring , the discharge variation process of karst spring wa divided into natural fluctuation phase and anthropogenic impact phase . Discharge attenuation of the 7 karst spring wa controlled mainly by climate and human activity , with their contribution being respectively about 60 % and 40 % . According to the difference of the effect of climate and human activity for each spring , attenuation mode of spring discharge fall into three type : natural process dominated attenuation type , exploitation induced process dominated attenuation type , and mixed attenuation type . The total restored discharge variation of 7 karst spring matched well with the global air temperature change in 1956-2000 , clearly indicating the trend of global warming and aridity in the last several decade , and the analysis of discharge variation process of karst spring can be used a a new tool for global change study .

aVResponse of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation ( THC ) to global warming is examined by using the climate system model developed at IAP/LASG . The evidence indicates that the gradually warming climate associated with the increased atmospheric carbon dioxide lead to a warmer and fresher sea surface water at the high latitude of the North Atlantic Ocean , which prevents the down-welling of the surface water . The succedent reduction of the pole-to-equator meridional potential density gradient finally result in the decrease of the THC in intensity . When the atmospheric carbon dioxide is doubled , the maximum value of the Atlantic THC decrease approximately by 8 % . The associated poleward oceanic heat transport also becomes weaker . This kind of THC weakening centralizes mainly in the northern part of the North Atlantic basin , indicating briefly a local scale adjustment rather than a loop oscillation with the whole Atlantic `` conveyor belt '' decelerating .

aVDaily observation of sea-surface temperature ( SST ) have been acquired at the southern end of Monterey Bay in Pacific Grove , California since 1919 . It is one of the longest oceanographic record off the west coast of North America . The record is examined to determine the major source of variability in Monterey Bay and beyond , on time scale from seasonal to interdecadal . On seasonal time scale , the spring transition to coastal upwelling , often a major event along the coast of central California . is not well-expressed inside the bay but is detectable , occurring , on average , between mid-March and mid-April . The onset of the Davidson Current in Monterey Bay is well-defined , occurring , on average . in mid-October , +/- 2-3 week . Intraseasonal change also occur during the spring and summer that may correspond to intrusion of warmer offshore water into Monterey Bay . Intraseasonal oscillation with period in the range of 40-50 day occur in Monterey Bay , but compared to their signature along the open coast , their event-like behavior is modified . The annual cycle of surface temperature in Monterey Bay is asymmetric with seasonal warming occurring during the spring and summer , and cooling during the fall . This asymmetry is primarily due to the net surface heat exchange which is positive for most of the year , and . to a lesser extent , the influence cold upwelled water that are advected into the bay during the spring and summer , observation supported by a simple model that combine both the net surface heat exchange and thermal advection . On interannual time scale , the influence of El Nino warming event is strong . A comparison with the Northern Oscillation Index ( NOI ) using Singular Spectrum Analysis ( SSA ) , show that the El Nino signal is often a strong in SST at Pacific Grove a it is in the NOI . On interdecadal time scale , the influence of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation ( PDO ) is also relatively strong in Monterey Bay , again based on SSA . The integrated anomaly wa calculated from the record and reveals regime shift in Monterey Bay that occurred in 1929 , an event that wa apparently regional in scale , reflecting a transition from unusually cold to warmer condition , and the regime change in the PDO that occurred in 1976 . Each regime change can be approximated by a step-wise increase in temperature . Finally , linear trend were estimated for the entire record ( similar to +0.01 C/year ) , and for the 72-year period from 1930 to 2001 ( + 0.0042 C/year ) , i.e. , following the regional regime change in 1929 . The estimated trend for the last 72 year is not statistically significant , however , it is in close agreement with the long-term trend for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) record of global surface temperature that span almost 140 year ( similar to + 0.005 C/year ) . Although the long-term increase in SST at Pacific Grove appears to be consistent with global warming , the integrated anomaly suggests that temperature increase in Monterey Bay have occurred rather abruptly and thus it becomes more difficult to invoke the global warming scenario . Finally , based oil the monthly averaged data , the annual cycle , El Nino warming episode , the PDO . the long-term trend , and the semiannual cycle account for approximately 44 % . 18 % . 6 % , 4 % , and 3 % of the total variance , respectively in SST at Pacific Grove .

aVReducing and off-setting anthropogenic emission of CO , and other greenhouse gas ( GHGs ) are important strategy of mitigating the greenhouse effect . Thus , the need for developing carbon ( C ) neutral and renewable source of energy is more than ever before . Use of crop residue a a possible source of feedstock for bioenergy production must be critically and objectively assessed because of it positive impact on soil C sequestration.. soil quality maintenance and ecosystem function . The amount of crop residue produced in the US is estimated at 367x10 ( 6 ) Mg/year for 9 cereal crop , 450x10 ( 6 ) Mg/year for 14 cereal and legume , and 488x10 ( 6 ) Mg/year for 21 crop . The amount of crop residue produced in the world is estimated at 2802x10 ( 6 ) Mg/year for cereal crop , 3107x10 ( 6 ) Mg/year for 17 cereal and legume , and 3758x10 ( 6 ) Mg/year for 27 food crop . The fuel value of the total annual residue produced is estimated at 1.5x10 ( 15 ) kcal , about I billion barrel ( bbl ) of diesel equivalent , or about 8 quad for the US ; and 11.3x10 ( 15 ) kcal , about 7.5 billion bbl of diesel or 60 quad for the world . However , even a partial removal ( 30-40 % ) of crop residue from land can exacerbate soil erosion hazard , deplete the SOC pool , accentuate emission of CO , and other GHGs from soil to the atmosphere , and exacerbate the risk of global climate change . Therefore , establishing bioenergy plantation of site-specific specie with potential of producing 10-15 Mg biomass/year is an option that need to be considered . This option will require 40-60 million hectare of land in the US and about 250 million hectare worldwide to establish bioenergy plantation . ( c ) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVMongolian boreal forest merit special attention since it is located in the transitional area between the southern Siberian boreal forest and the Asian steppe zone , a vulnerable region being potentially affected by global warming and anthropogenic activity . This paper present the first full-year-long continuous measurement of net ecosystem CO2 flux ( NEE ) made over a montane larch ( Larix sibirica Ledeb . ) forest in Mongolia from 25 March 2003 to 24 March 2004 ( 366 day ) using the eddy covariance technique . The hourly maximum uptake wa -10.1 & mu ; mol m ( -2 ) s ( -1 ) . The maximum daily uptake of -4.0 g C m ( -2 ) d ( -1 ) ( negative NEE value denote net carbon uptake by the canopy from the atmosphere ) occurred in July . The annual cumulative NEE wa -85 g C m ( -2 ) , indicating that the forest acted a a net sink of CO2 . We examined the response of NEE to environmental condition in the growing season from May to September . Both daytime 30-min mean and daily integrated NEE responded to incident photosynthetically active radiation ( PAR ) in a rectangular hyperbolic fashion . Model result show that the apparent quantum yield ( & alpha ; ) wa -0.0133 & PLUSMN ; 0.0011 mmol CO2 per & mu ; mol of photon , and the bulk light use efficiency ( LUE ) on the daily basis wa -6.7 mmol CO2 per mole of PAR photon over the entire growing season for this forest . Additionally , daily integrated NEE wa also a linear function of the normalized difference vegetation index ( NDVI ) , a linear function of mean daily air temperature ( T-a ) , and a quadratic polynomial function of daily mean of the atmospheric water vapor pressure deficit ( VPD ) . Among these factor , LAI ( a measured by NDVI ) wa dominant in affecting the dynamic of NEE , followed by T-a . Lower T-a wa limiting the growth rate of this montane larch forest . As daily mean of VPD exceeded 1.2 kPa , net CO2 uptake by the canopy declined . Nevertheless , water stress wa not observed a a problem for the forest growth .

aVPredictions of the effect of global warming suggest that climate change may have large impact on ecosystem . The length of the growing season is predicted to increase in response to increasing global temperature . The object of this study wa to evaluate different index used for calculating the thermal growing season for the Greater Baltic Area ( GBA ) . We included established index of growing season start , end and length , a well a new and modified index . Based on the result , the GBA can be divided into a maritime western part and a more continental eastern part , with the western part reacting more sensitively to the use of different index . The eastern part is more stable , but even here the index-to-index difference are large . It wa found that including or excluding a frost criterion had a significant influence on the initiation of the growing season in the western , maritime , part of the GBA . Frost ha not the same importance for the end of the growing season . However , some end index can result in a `` never ending '' growing season . When looking at twentieth century trend in growing season parameter , it wa found that , when averaged over the whole GBA , there wa little difference in trend depending on the index used . The general mean trend in the GBA for the twentieth century discloses an earlier onset of c. 12 day , a delayed end of c. 8 day and consequently a lengthening of the growing season of about 20 day .

aVThe energetic utilisation of agricultural residue is considered to be an important element in any strategy to achieve renewable energy target . In the approximately 80 cane-sugar producing country there is potential to make better use of the fibrous residue known a bagasse . Subject to improved energy efficiency , sugar producer could supply energy either a `` green '' , co-generated electricity , or a fuel ethanol through cellulose hydrolysis followed by fermentation . This paper compare their projected environmental benefit from a life-cycle perspective , using South African data . Mass and energy analysis were prepared for the two system and a base case ( producing sugar with current method ) , relative to the annual sugarcane production on one hectare . In both case , the environmental burden avoided by replacing an equivalent amount of fossil energy were included . The result obtained confirm that for all the impact category considered , both `` bioenergy '' product result in environmental benefit . The cogeneration option result in lower energy-related emission ( i.e . lower global warming , acidification and eutrophication potential ) , whereas the fuel ethanol option is preferred in term of resource conservation ( since it is assumed to replace oil not coal ) , and also score better in term of human and eco-toxicity if assumed to replace lead-bearing oxygenates .

aVA portable microwave plasma torch at atmospheric pressure by making use of magnetron operated at 2.45 GHz and used in a home microwave oven ha been developed . This electrodeless torch can be used in various area including commercial , environmental and military application . For example , perfluorocompounds ( PFCs ) , which have long lifetime and serious global warming implication , are widely used during plasma etching and plasma-assisted chamber cleaning process in chemical vapour deposition system . The microwave torch effectively eliminates PFCs . Efficient decomposition of toluene gas indicates the effectiveness of volatile organic compound elimination from industrial emission and the elimination of airborne chemical and biological warfare agent . The microwave torch ha been used to synthesize carbon nanotube in an on-line system , thereby providing the opportunity of mass production of the nanotube . There are other application of the microwave plasma torch .

aVClimatic anomaly may produce , or accelerate , geographic range expansion of specie limited by temperature or other climatic variable . Most such expansion are only temporary , before the prevailing climatic condition drive the founder population extinct . In contrast , here , we report a recent rapid shift of the range limit during the record hot summer of 2003 in southern Europe that ha the potential to be both permanent , and to have important implication on specie range dynamic in general . The winter pine processionary moth ( Thaumetopoea pityocampa ) , an important pine defoliator whose larva feed in colony during the winter , is limited in it distribution by winter temperature . In the last three decade , warmer winter have led to a gradual but substantial expansion of it range both latitudinally and altitudinally . In the summer of 2003 , T. pityocampa underwent an extraordinary expansion to high elevation pine stand in the Italian Alps ; it altitudinal range limit increased by one third of the total altitudinal expansion over the previous three decade . In an experiment , we found flight activity of newly emerged female to increase with temperature . By determining a threshold temperature for flight take-offs under controlled condition , we calculated that the night above the threshold temperature were over five time more frequent , and considerably warmer , at the range limit in 2003 than in an average year . We therefore attribute the colonization of extreme , high-elevation site to increased nocturnal dispersal of female during the unusually warm night temperature in June - August 2003 . Importantly , the colony established at extreme site survived the winter and produced offspring in 2004 , although the range did not expand further because of low night temperature that year . We discus several life-history characteristic of T. pityocampa that maximize the likelihood of population persistence at the new range limit . As global warming continues and climatic anomaly are predicted to become more frequent , our result draw attention to the importance of extreme climatic event in the range formation of phytophagous insect .

aVAccelerator mass spectrometry ( AMS ) radiocarbon dating of basal high-marsh sediment from Romney Marsh , Revere , Massachusetts , provides a revised reconstruction of the late Holocene relative sea-level history of the region . After correction for change in tidal amplitude , the sea-level change envelope reconstructed from five AMS radiocarbon date of basal marsh sediment at Romney Marsh in Revere , Massachusetts , indicates a rise in mean sea level ( MSL ) of close to 2.6 m in the past 3300 year . The data indicate a possible decrease in the average rate of rise from 0.80 +/- 0.25 mm/y between 3300 to 1000 YBP to a rate of 0.52 +/- 0.62 mm/y between 1000 YBP and the past 150 to 500 year . An increase in the rate of sea-level rise is evident over the past few hundred year . A slowing of the rate of sea-level rise between 1000 YBP and historic time and the increase in the rate of rise to modern value is also evident in other sea-level record from Maine and Connecticut . The coherence between these sea-level record and concomitant climate change in and around the North Atlantic indicates that regional-scale sea-level fluctuation in the region may be driven by climate forcing . However , earlier sea-level fluctuation correlated to sea-surface temperature variability are not well-resolved by this record or other record in the region and may indicate that change in sea level are not tightly coupled with sea-surface temperature change .

aVAn exceptional analogue for the study of the cause and consequence of global warming occurs at the Palaeocene/ Eocene Thermal Maximum , 55 million year ago . A rapid rise of global temperature during this event accompanied turnover in both marine ( 1-3 ) and terrestrial biota ( 4 ) , a well a significant change in ocean chemistry ( 5,6 ) and circulation ( 7,8 ) . Here we present evidence for an abrupt shift in deep-ocean circulation using carbon isotope record from fourteen site . These record indicate that deep-ocean circulation pattern changed from Southern Hemisphere overturning to Northern Hemisphere overturning at the start of the Palaeocene/ Eocene Thermal Maximum . This shift in the location of deep-water formation persisted for at least 40,000 year , but eventually recovered to original circulation pattern . These result corroborate climate model inference that a shift in deep-ocean circulation would deliver relatively warmer water to the deep sea , thus producing further warming ( 9 ) . Greenhouse condition can thus initiate abrupt deep-ocean circulation change in le than a few thousand year , but may have lasting effect ; in this case taking 100,000 year to revert to background condition .

Populations , however , are rapidly disappearing particularly in the Michoacan State a native forest are converted to avocado ( Persea sp . ) orchard . We investigated the patterning of genetic variation among R oocarpa population for quantitative trait along an altitudinal gradient by establishing a provenance/progeny test from wind-pollinated seed collected along an altitudinal transect ( 1100-1500 m ) near Uruapan , Michoacan , Mexico . Genetic variation wa analyzed in relation to normalized climate record ( temperature , precipitation , degree day > 5 degree C and annual moisture index ) for the provenance and the test site for the contemporary climate and for climate projected for the decade beginning in 2030 , 2060 , and 2090 . Estimates of future climate used output from the Canadian and Hadley General Circulation Models . Results of a field test suggested an altitudinal pattern of genetic differentiation in juvenile height among P. oocarpa population . Seedlings from population originating from lower altitude tended to grow more than seedling originating from population at the higher altitude . However , this trend abates at the lowest altitudinal limit of the specie distribution , a probable conservative growth strategy for avoiding drought stress . Thus , the cline appeared to arise from selection along a climatic gradient reflecting in a moisture index ( ratio of degree day to precipitation ) and is dependent , therefore , on a balance between temperature and moisture . For guiding seed and seedling transfer in ecological restoration , conservation of genetic resource , tree breeding and mitigating the effect of global warming , we suggest guideline based on delimitation of three altitudinal seed zone of about 200 m in breadth . Alternatively , one can limit transfer to three climatic zone of about 0.75 unit of annual moisture index . Predictions of future climate indicate an average annual temperature increase of 3.8 degree C by year 2090 , and , judging from an increase of an annual moisture index of 26 % , an increase in aridity by the end of the century . However , the more difficult period for adaptation of P oocarpa population to the new climate should be between 2030 and 2060 , when the increase in aridity is expected to be most pronounced . Changes of this magnitude should alter the natural distribution of the specie and would create an adaptational lag , a the adaptedness of extant population deteriorates . Mitigating these effect will require seed to be transferred upwards in altitude , perhaps a much a 150 m initially . ( c ) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All right reserved .

aVKnowledge of breeding bird distribution and abundance in the Canadian Arctic remains rudimentary for many specie , particularly for shorebird and songbird . To help fill this gap , randomly selected plot were surveyed on the northwestern coast of the Ungava Peninsula , Quebec , Canada , during 2002 . Thirty-eight specie were recorded at 34 site , where small songbird were much more frequent than shorebird . Breeding waterbird were more abundant at low elevation near the coast , and songbird tended to be more abundant at higher elevation . A high occurrence of nesting hawk and owl wa probably the result of a high lemming population . Information from the survey extended the known breeding range of green-winged teal , spotted sandpiper , pectoral sandpiper , dunlin , American golden-plover , Wilson 's snipe , and short-eared owl . Further work on the Ungava Peninsula would likely document additional Arctic-breeding bird specie . A more thorough knowledge of Arctic-breeding bird distribution will be needed to determine how specie might be affected by global climate change .

aVIncreasing concentration of CO2 and other greenhouse gas ( GHG ) in the Earth 's atmosphere have the potential to enhance the natural greenhouse effect , which may result in climatic change . The main anthropogenic contributor to this increase are fossil fuel combustion , land use conversion , and soil cultivation . It is clear that overcoming the challenge of global climate change will require a combination of approach , including increased energy efficiency , energy conservation , alternative energy source , and carbon ( C ) capture and sequestration . The United States Department of Energy ( DOE ) is sponsoring the development of new technology that can provide energy and promote economic prosperity while reducing GHG emission . One option that can contribute to achieving this goal is the capture and sequestration of CO2 in geologic formation . An alternative approach is C sequestration in terrestrial ecosystsems through natural process . Enhancing such natural pool ( known a natural sequestration ) can make a significant contribution to CO2 management strategy with the potential to sequester about 290 Tg C/y in U.S. soil . In addition to soil , there is also a large potential for C sequestration in above and belowground biomass in forest ecosystem . A major area of interest to DOE 's fossil energy program is reclaimed mined land , of which there may be 0.63 x10 ( 6 ) supercript stop ha in the U.S . These area are essentially devoid of soil C ; therefore , they provide an excellent opportunity to sequester C in both soil and vegetation . Measurement of C in these ecosystem requires the development of new technology and protocol that are accurate and economically viable . Field demonstration are needed to accurately determine C sequestration potential and to demonstrate the ecological and aesthetic benefit in improved soil and water quality , increased biodiversity , and restored ecosystem . The DOE 's research program in natural sequestration highlight fundamental and applied study , such a the development of measurement , monitoring , and verification technology and protocol and field test aimed at developing technique for maximizing the productivity of hitherto infertile soil and degraded ecosystem .

aVTheoretical analysis of a solar energy-powered Rankine thermodynamic cycle utilizing an innovative new concept , which us supercritical carbon dioxide a a working fluid , is presented . In this system , a truly 'natural ' working fluid , carbon dioxide , is utilized to generate firstly electricity power and secondly high-grade heat power and low-grade heat power . The uniqueness of the system is in the way in which both solar energy and carbon dioxide , available in abundant quantity in all part of the world , are simultaneously used to build up a thermodynamic cycle and ha the potential to reduce energy shortage and greatly reduce carbon dioxide emission and global warming , offering environmental and personal safety simultaneously . The system consists of an evacuated solar collector system , a power-generating turbine , a high-grade heat recovery system , a low-grade heat recovery system and a feed pump . The performance of this CO2-based Rankine cycle were theoretically investigated and the effect of various design condition , namely , solar radiation , solar collector area and CO2 flow rate , were studied . Numerical simulation show that the proposed system may have electricity power efficiency and heat power efficiency a high a 11.4 % and 36.2 % , respectively . It is also found that the cycle performance strongly depend on climate condition . Also the electricity power and heat power output increase with the collector area and CO2 flow rate . The estimated COPpower and COPheat increase with the CO , flow rate , but decrease with the collector area . The CO2-based cycle can be optimized to provide maximum power , maximum heat recovery or a combination of both . The result suggest the potential of this new concept for application to electricity power and heat power generation .

aVThis study analyzes the impact of an electricity grid interconnection between Korea and Japan oil their energy system . Both country seriously consider energy security a the most important policy issue because of it lack of domestic energy resource . In addition , public concern for the environment is recently rising LIP in response to the global warming . Electricity grid interconnection ha strong potential to cope with such complicated problem cost-effectively . We have developed the interconnection model , which includes the electricity grid interconnection between the electricity sector of Korea and Japan , considering both technological and economic efficiency . The result of the study reveals the significant cost-effectiveness of the interconnection , in particular , under stringent condition Such it nuclear phase-out in Japan and CO , emission target in Korea and Japan . In the case that Japan 's nuclear power plant will be phased out , the interconnection attains further cost reduction of constructing substitutive thermal power plant . On the other hand , when Korea and Japan set a joint CO2 emission target , it achieves the emission target more efficiently than they reduce the emission individually . ( c ) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

aVWe investigated aquatic plant diversity by conducting the field investigation and collecting the published data in the arid region of Northwest China . Two hundred and twenty four taxon of vascular aquatic plant representing 64 genus and 34 family occur in this area , 8.48 % of which are endemic . Among these , 1 genus and 6 specie were new state record and 1 family , 9 genus and 29 specie were new area record . Typhaceae , Potamogetonaceae , Juncaginaceae and Haloragaceae were the most frequent family ( considering relative frequency of occurrence ) , whereas Cyperaceae , Potamogetonaceae and Ranuncnlaceae are the most species-rich . The most frequent genus were Typha , Potamogeton , and Triglochin , and the most species-rich were Potamogeton , Eleocharis and Scirpus . The most frequent specie are Triglochin palustre , Myriophyllum spicatum , Potamogeton pectinatus and Typha angustifolia . Aquatic plant diversity is distributed unevenly in the region . The maximum specie occurs in Dzungarian basin while the least specie in Hexi corridor . The aquatic flora in arid zone of China is not distinctive although some endemic specie are found , most specie are widely distributed . Local aquatic plant diversity can be influenced by many factor such a hydrological alteration , habitat loss , over-grazing , high human population pressure , global climate change , an inappropriate economic development policy . Among them , the largest threat to aquatic plant biodiversity may be habitat loss due to hydrological alteration . In order to conserve the aquatic plant biological resource and biodiversity in this region , some strategy and measure must be suggested including strengthening scientific research and biodiversity education in the local people , balancing economic development and ecological conservation , and enhancing governmental assistance and subsidy to the local resident .

aVThe mid-Holocene ( ca . 8000-4000 cal yr BP ) wa a time of marked aridity throughout much of Minnesota , and the change due to mid-Holocene aridity are seen a an analog for future response to global warming . In this study , we compare the transition into ( ca . 9000-7000 yr ago ) and out of ( ca . 5000-2500 yr ago ) the mid-Holocene ( MH ) period at Kimble Pond and Sharkey Lake , located along the prairie forest ecotone in south-central Minnesota , using high resolution ( similar to 5-36yr ) sampling of pollen , charcoal , sediment magnetic and loss-on-ignition property . Changes in vegetation were asymmetrical with increasing aridity being marked by a pronounced shift from woodland/forest-dominated landscape to a more open mix of grassland and woodland/savanna . In contrast , at the end of the MH , grassland remained an important component of the landscape despite increasing effective moisture , and high charcoal influx ( median 2.7-4.0 vs. 0.6-1.7mm ( 2 ) cm ( -2 ) yr ( -1 ) at start of MH ) suggest the role of fire in limiting woodland expansion . Asymmetric vegetation response , variation among and within proxy , and the near-absence of fire today suggest caution in using change associated with mid-Holocene aridity at the prairie forest boundary a an analog for future response to global warming .

aVNorthwestern Mediterranean warming-related disease outbreak and specie shift have recently been documented . Biomarkers of short-term effect on the health or resistance of organism are necessary to ass and understand mechanism affecting marine biodiversity . Heat-shock protein ( HSP ) expression wa here believed to present finer variation than previously reported in experimental study , which we tested to ass HSP sensitivity and relevance in the global warming context . One population of the `` thermophilic '' marine cave mysid Hemimysis margalefi wa monitored over 4 year . Three HSPs presented recurrent expression . Among them , HSP50 and HSP60 expression varied seasonally with environmental temperature . HSP60 expression displayed the greatest variability and wa most closely related to temperature fluctuation . Multiple regression showed that while the main stressor wa temperature , demographic variable ( proportion of immatures , proportion of gravid female ) also influenced expression variability . Such a monitoring of HSP baseline expression in a natural population had only rarely been conducted . HSPs are , however , good biomarkers to evaluate the effect of warming episode or heat stress in the wild . This study provides essential spatial and temporal reference for further experimental and in situ analysis and is a prerequisite to diagnostic and predictive approach .

aVThis article discus the potential use of biogas from municipal landfill to fuel urban heat space in Turkey . Biogas can be obtained from digesting the organic material of municipal solid waste ( MSW ) . The composition of MSW varies by the source of waste ; however , in all case the major constituent of MSW are organic in nature and the organic account for more than 50 % of MSW . The main constituent of landfill gas are methane and carbon dioxide , both of which are major contributor to global warming . The generation of methane is worthwhile after one year from the start of the landfill operation . The compositional characteristic of MSW vary considerably from the large city to the small town and region in Turkey . The social and demographic factor for each region are very different .

aVUsing museum data of adult specimen whose sex , age , and locality are known , we studied temporal and geographical body size trend among the otter , Lutra lutra , in Norway . We found that body size of the otter increased during the last quarter of the twentieth century , and suggest that this trend is related to increased food availability from fish farming and possibly also to energy saving due to elevated sea temperature . Birth year and death year explained 38.8 and 43.5 % , respectively , of the variation in body size . Body size of otter wa positively related to latitude , thus conforming to Bergmann 's rule .

aVPredictions of specie invasion are often made using information from their native range . Acquisition of native-range information can be very costly and time-consuming and in some case may not reflect condition in the invaded range . Using information from the invaded range can enable much faster modeling at finer geographic resolution than using information from a specie ' native range . We used confirmed presence point from the native range , southern Africa , and the invaded range , the southwestern United States , to predict the potential distribution of the perennial bunchgrass Eragrostis lehmanniana Nees , ( Lehmann lovegrass ) , in it invaded range in the United States . The two model showed strong agreement for the area encompassed by the presence point in the invaded range , and offered insight into the overlapping but slightly different ecological niche occupied by the introduced grass in the invaded range . Regions outside of the scope of inference showed le agreement between the two model . E. lehmanniana wa selected via seeding trial before being planted in the United States and therefore represents an isolated genotype from the native-range population . Models built using confirmed presence point from the invaded range can provide insight into how the selected genotype is expressed on the landscape and considers influence not present in the native range . Models created from location in both the invaded and native range can lead to a more complete understanding of an introduced specie ' potential for spread , especially in the case of anthropogenic selection .

aVThis synthesis ha three main part . The first discus the overall tree of life and nature of the last common ancestor ( cenancestor ) . I emphasize key step in cellular evolution important for ordering and timing the major evolutionary innovation in the history of the biosphere , explaining especially the origin of the eukaryote cell and of bacterial flagellum and cell envelope novelty . Second , I map the tree onto the fossil record and discus date of key event and their biogeochemical impact . Finally , I present a broad synthesis , discussing evidence for a three-phase history of life . The first phase began perhaps ca 3.5 Gyr ago , when the origin of cell and anoxic photosynthesis generated the arguably most primitive prokaryote phylum , Chlorobacteria ( =Chloroflexi ) , the first negibacteria with cell bounded by two acyl ester phospholipid membrane . After this 'chlorobacterial age ' of benthic anaerobic evolution protected from UV radiation by mineral grain , two momentous quantum evolutionary episode of cellular innovation and microbial radiation dramatically transformed the Earth 's surface : the glycobacterial revolution initiated an oxygenic 'age of cyanobacteria ' and , a the ozone layer grew , the rise of plankton ; immensely later , probably a recently a ca 0.9 Gyr ago , the neomuran revolution ushered in the 'age of eukaryote ' , Archaebacteria ( arguably the youngest bacterial phylum ) , and morphological complexity . Diversification of glycobacteria ca 2.8 Gyr ago , predominantly inhabiting stratified benthic mat , I suggest caused serial depletion of C-13 by ribulose 1,5-bis-phosphate caboxylase/oxygenase ( Rubisco ) to yield ultralight late Archaean organic carbon formerly attributed to methanogenesis plus methanotrophy . The late origin of archaebacterial methanogenesis ca 720 Myr ago perhaps triggered snowball Earth episode by slight global warming increasing weathering and reducing CO2 level , to yield runaway cooling ; the origin of anaerobic methane oxidation ca 570 Myr ago reduced methane flux at source , stabilizing Phanerozoic climate . I argue that the major cellular innovation exhibit a pattern of quantum evolution followed by very rapid radiation and then substantial stasis , a described by Simpson . They yielded organism that are a mosaic of extremely conservative and radically novel feature , a characterized by De Beer 's phrase 'mosaic evolution ' . Evolution is not evenly paced and there are no real molecular clock .

aVThe change in the thermohaline circulation ( THC ) because of the increased COZ in the atmosphere play an important role in future climate regime . In this article , a new climate model developed at the Max-Planck Institute for Meteorology is used to study the variation in THC strength , the change of North Atlantic deep-water ( NADW ) formation , and the regional response of the THC in the North Atlantic to increasing atmospheric CO2 . From 2000 to 2100 , under increased CO , scenario ( B1 , A1B , and A2 ) , the strength of THC decrease by 4 Sv ( 106 m ( 3 ) /s ) , 5.1 Sv , and 5.2 Sv , respectively , equivalent to a reduction of 20 O , 25 % , and 25.1 % of the present THC strength . The analysis show that the oceanic deep convective activity significantly strengthens in the Greenland-Iceland-Norway ( GIN ) Seas owing to saltier ( denser ) upper ocean , whereas weakens in the Labrador Sea and in the south of the Denmark Strait region ( SDSR ) because of surface warming and freshening due to global warming . The saltiness of the GIN Seas is mainly caused by the increase of the saline North Atlantic inflow through the Faro-Bank ( FB ) Channel . Under the scenario AIB , the deep-water formation rate in the North Atlantic decrease from 16 . 2 Sv to 12 . 9 Sv with increasing CO2 .

aVAZ91 alloy in it molten state oxidizes rapidly in atmospheric condition and begin to burn from the melt surface . In order to prevent the molten AZ91 alloy from burning , it is usually protected by a cover gas Such a sulfur hexafluoride ( SF6 ) . However , the use of SF6 gas pose a serious threat to the environment a it is widely acknowledged to contribute to the global warming effect . Thus , several type of study aimed at controlling the oxidation behavior of molten magnesium alloy have been carried out . This paper describes the characteristic of the oxide layer formed oil molten AZ91 alloy containing Ca and Be . The Surface analysis technique of GDS ( Glow Discharge Spectroscopy ) wa used to investigate the oxide layer of AZ91 alloy containing Ca and Be . The GDS result showed that the oxide layer consists of CaO , MgO , BeO and Al2O3 .

aVMany people would be increasingly affected by living under critical condition in Latin America if , a expected , global warming aggravates disease and pest transmission process . Heat wave and air pollution would increase heat-related disease and illness episode in large city . Fire smoke ha been associated with irritation of the throat , lung and eye , and respiratory problem . Climate extreme increase associated with climate change would cause physical damage , population displacement , and adverse effect on food production , freshwater availability and quality . It would also increase the risk of infectious and vector-borne disease . Climate change impact the geographical range , seasonality , and the incidence rate of vector-borne disease . such a malaria . Climate-related ecological change may expand cholera transmission , particularly population in low-laying tropical coastal area . El Nino condition may affect the incidence of infectious disease , such a malaria . Ocean warming would increase temperature-sensitive toxin produced by phytoplankton , which could cause more frequent contamination of seafood . A clearer understanding on the current role of climate change in disease pattern will be able to improve forecast of potential future impact of projected climate change and support action to reduce such impact .

aVRelative effect of weather and three-trophic interaction were studied for a classical biological control system consisting of the arrowhead scale Unaspis yanonensis , known formerly a a serious pest of the Satsuma mandarin orange Citrus unshiu , and it two introduced parasitoids , Coccobius fulvus and Aphytis yanonensis . Yearly population response of the three insect specie on a per-tree basis for up to 10 year at two orange grove were analyzed by general linear model , with a backward stepwise procedure , to select among abiotic ( summer/winter temperature and rainfall ) and biotic ( density of the three insect specie and orange bearing in the previous year ) independent variable . Temperature positively affected the arrowhead scale and the two parasitoids . A negative correlation of rainfall wa detected for all three insect specie . Mandarin fruiting showed negative delayed density dependence , thereby supporting the observed alternate bearing phenomenon in mandarin , presumably due to physiological imbalance triggered by climatic factor . The arrowhead scale wa negatively correlated with fruit production in the preceding year , possibly due to reduced resistance in subsequent year of mast fruiting . We found a negative correlation of the arrowhead scale with Coccobius only in a single grove and none with Aphytis . Thus , it appears that bottom-up force may be more important than top-down control by the parasitoids in the post-transient phase of this system .

aVWe explored the climate impact for two land-use change scenario , aimed at mitigating the buildup of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere . Using the integrated assessment model IMAGE 2.2 , we found that the large-scale implementation in the extratropics of either carbon-sequestration or modern-biomass plantation decrease the CO2 concentration with 70-80 ppmv by the year 2100 compared to a nonmitigation baseline . In a coupled land/atmosphere/ocean/sea-ice model this moderate global warming over the 21st century by 10 % . However , the carbon-sequestration option raise the absorption of solar radiation due to a lower albedo compared to the scenario involving modern-biomass plantation ( for biofuels production ) . The albedo-induced difference in global mean temperature is a large a the mitigation by CO2 change in the two scenario compared to the baseline . Further , an atmospheric circulation change in the carbon-plantation scenario weakens the supply of moisture from the ocean to North Africa and central Eurasia . In our model this decrease annual mean precipitation over North Africa by up to 10 % and further increase summer temperature over Eurasia . These finding lead u to conclude that other climate impact than just CO2 change have to be taken into account when discussing climate-change mitigation option that involve land-use change .

aVLife-history reaction of a pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus population in north-eastern France exposed to heated water were studied . The study wa conducted from 2001 to 2003 in an artificial reservoir , adjacent to a nuclear power plant , in which water temperature are cool in winter ( 8.2-12.4 degree C ) and rise early in spring ( April : 14-7 degree C ) nearly 5 degree C and 3 degree C over the temperature of it tributary , respectively . Fast growth among young-of-the-year , precocious maturity and short life span were observed , in contrast to related study . The short life span appeared to be the price paid for early maturity in breeding fish , which suffered high mortality rate just after their first reproduction .

aVThe effect of elevated carbon dioxide on plant-herbivore interaction have been summarized in a number of narrative review and metaanalyses , while accompanying elevation of temperature ha not received sufficient attention . The goal of our study is to search , by mean of metaanalysis , for a general pattern in response of herbivore , and plant characteristic important for herbivore , to simultaneous experimental increase of carbon dioxide and temperature ( ECET ) in comparison with both ambient condition and response to elevated CO2 ( EC ) and temperature ( ET ) applied separately . Our database includes 42 paper describing study of 31 plant specie and seven herbivore specie . Nitrogen concentration and C/N ratio in plant decreased under both EC and ECET treatment , whereas ET had no significant effect . Concentrations of nonstructural carbohydrate and phenolic increased in EC , decreased in ET and did not change in ECET treatment , whereas terpene did not respond to EC but increased in both ET and ECET ; leaf toughness increased in both EC and ECET . Responses of defensive secondary compound to treatment differed between woody and green tissue a well a between gymnosperm and angiosperm plant . Insect herbivore performance wa adversely affected by EC , favoured by ET , and not modified by ECET . Our analysis allowed to distinguish three type of relationship between CO2 and temperature elevation : ( 1 ) response to EC do not depend on temperature ( nitrogen , C/N , leaf toughness , phenolic in angiosperm leaf ) , ( 2 ) response to EC are mitigated by ET ( sugar and starch , terpene in needle of gymnosperm , insect performance ) and ( 3 ) effect emerge only under ECET ( nitrogen in gymnosperm , and phenolic and terpene in woody tissue ) . This result indicates that conclusion of CO2 elevation study can not be directly extrapolated to a more realistic climate change scenario . The predicted negative effect of CO2 elevation on herbivore are likely to be mitigated by temperature increase .

aVThe 1998 global coral bleaching event wa the largest recorded historical disturbance of coral reef and resulted in extensive habitat loss . Annual census of reef fish community structure over a 12-year period spanning the bleaching event revealed a marked phase shift from a prebleach to postbleach assemblage . Surprisingly , we found that the bleaching event had no detectable effect on the abundance , diversity or specie richness of a local cryptobenthic reef fish community . Furthermore , there is no evidence of regeneration even after 5-35 generation of these short-lived specie . These result have significant implication for our understanding of the response of coral reef ecosystem to global warming and highlight the importance of selecting appropriate criterion for evaluating reef resilience .

aVOngoing conflict over the fair allocation of greenhouse gas emission among nation is a significant impediment to progress in international climate change negotiation . This article considers the strength and weakness of a crucial argument within the allocation debate asserting the atmospheric capacity to absorb greenhouse gas should be distributed oil an equal per caput basis . While noting the argument 's many appealing quality , the paper argues that the per caput perspective also encompasses important practical and ethical limitation . Besides potentially encouraging Population growth and discriminating against those with greater ( but still legitimate ) energy need , early evidence suggests that the equal per caput idea may hinder progress in climate change talk by invoking a more absolutist and uncompromising rhetoric of right . Alternative idea of fairness , Such a the distinction between Subsistence and luxury emission , or the Common Heritage of Mankind idea , offer a more flexible mix of egalitarian and other allocation principle that should be considered carefully , even by those sympathetic to the equal per caput perspective .

aVIt is very important to detect change in forest productivity due to the global change on a large scale . In this work , the evolution of the vegetation in the Komi Republic ( northwestern Russia ) from 1982 to 2001 wa analyzed using NOAA AVHRR PAL time series . A statistically significant correlation ( adjusted r ( 2 ) = 0.44-0.59 ) between Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ( NDVI ) data and tree ring width ( 261 living tree ) wa identified for the territory of the Komi Republic . The increased site productivity reflected an increase of integrated NDVI value from June to August . This allows NDVI to be used a a proxy for estimation of forest growth trend for the recent decade . A positive and significant trend in NDVI data wa identified from 1982 to 2001 , coinciding with an increase in site productivity in the study area . The decrease in precipitation coincided with an increase in site productivity ( highest r ( 2 ) wa 0.71 ) . The increase in productivity reflected in NDVI data is maximal on the site with increased temperature and decreased precipitation . In the Komi Republic the distribution of the trend in NDVI data change on the south-west to north-east gradient . NDVI data could be used to increase spatial resolution of tree ring width series . Taking into account the relatively small role of human activity in the Komi Republic compared with Europe , the site productivity during recent decade also increased in relatively untouched forest .

aVA benthological survey in a deep caldera , Lake Ikeda , southern Kyushu , Japan , in 1998 revealed that no zoobenthos were found in the deep profundal , although two tubificid oligochaete , Tubifex tubifex and Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri , and a chironomid , Procladius sp. , were distributed in the upper profundal zone . This is the first record of oligochaete composition in the lake . Lake Ikeda had been typically oligotrophic until the 1940s , and zoobenthic assemblage were recorded throughout the profundal bottom in the 1920s and 1970s . Recent disappearance of the deep profundal zoobenthos could be caused by the stagnation of anoxic water in the hypolimnion , in connection with eutrophication triggered by nutrient loading , a well a change in the thermal circulation system presumably caused by global warming .

aVTesting the effect of iron fertilization in booming metabolism of microbe in North Pacific Ocean ha become an important hot topic in current global climate change study . The first supportive evidence with natural iron input to ocean wa obtained by Bishop and his colleague at the PAPA region in North Pacific Ocean . They found a rapid increase of marine phytoplankton over North Pacific Ocean after a strong dust storm in April 2001 . We demonstrate that the dust deposition flux during this dust storm period decrease exponentially with increasing distance from the dust source region along the dust transport pathway , through integration of synoptic dynamic , change of TOMS-Al ( aerosol index ) and surface PM10 value along the dust pathway and change of particulate organic carbon and chlorophyll in surface ocean . This strong dust storm may result in deposition of about 3.1-5.8 mu g/m ( 3 ) eolian iron into the PAPA region in North Pacific Ocean , thus causing a rapid increase of marine phytoplankton productivity observed by Bishop and his colleague . This work supply more direct and detailed evidence , from continental dust process , to support the iron hypothesis with natural iron input to the surface ocean through dust storm .

aVThe dusty cloud radiative forcing over the middle latitude region of East Asia wa estimated by using the 2-year ( July 2002-June 2004 ) data of collocated cloud and the Earth 's radiant energy system ( CERES ) scanner and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) from Aqua Edition 1B SSF ( single scanner footprint ) . The dusty cloud is defined a the cloud in dust storm environment or dust contaminated cloud . For cloud growing in the presence of dust , the instantaneous short-wave ( SW ) forcing at the top of the atmosphere ( TOA ) is about -275.7 W/m ( 2 ) for cloud over dust ( COD ) region . The cloud developing in no-dust cloud ( CLD ) region yield the most negative short-wave ( SW ) forcing ( -311.0 W/m ( 2 ) ) , which is about 12.8 % stronger than those in COD region . For long-wave ( LW ) radiative forcing , the no-dust cloud ( CLD ) is around 102.8 W/m ( 2 ) , which is 20 % le than the LW forcing from COD region . The instantaneous TOA net radiative forcing for the CLD region is about -208.2 W/m ( 2 ) , which is 42.1 % larger than the value of COD region . The existence of dust aerosol under cloud significantly reduces the cooling effect of cloud .

aVIn the present study , long-term change in the first bloom date of shrub and tree specie in Seoul ( 126.56 degree E , 37.34 degree N ) , Korea were examined using historical observational data for the period 1922-2004 ( 83 year ) . The study focused on two shrub specie , golden-bell ( Forsythia koreana ) and azalea ( Rhododendron mucronulatum ) , and three tree specie , cherry ( Prunus yedoensis ) , peach ( Prunus persica ) , and American locust ( Robinia pseudoacacia ) . The annual-mean temperature ha increased by about 2 degree C in Seoul over the 83 year analyzed . The temperature increase is significant during the winter and early spring and becomes le significant during late spring . As a result of this regional warming , all five specie showed an advance in the first bloom date over this time period . The advanced date is particularly apparent in early-spring flowering specie like golden-bell ( -2.4 day 10-year ( -1 ) ) , azalea ( -2.4 day 10-year ( -1 ) ) , cherry ( -1.4 day 10-year ( -1 ) ) , and peach ( -1.4 day 10-year ( -1 ) ) a compared to late-spring flowering specie like American locust ( -0.5 day 10-year ( -1 ) ) . The present result have demonstrated that the major factor for the determination of flower blooming is heat accumulation , i.e . a certain threshold of growing degree-days ( GDD ) index . In particular , early spring flower were sensitive to the accumulation of warm temperature than late-spring flower . Copyright ( C ) 2006 Royal Meteorological Society .

Here we add two tool to this approach : evaluation of ecological requirement of specie and evaluation of future suitability for specie facing changing climate . We demonstrate this approach with two specie for which reintroduction programme are in the planning stage in Mexico : California condor Gymnogyps californianns and Mexican wolf Canis lupus baileyi . For the condor , we identify three area clustered in the Sierra San Pedro Martir , Baja California ; for the wolf , we identify a string of suitable site along the Sierra Madre Occidental of western Mexico . We discus the limitation of this approach , identifying way in which the model illustrated could be made more realistic and directly useful to reintroduction programme .

aVPlant specie vary in response to atmospheric CO2 concentration due to difference in physiology , morphology , phenology , and symbiotic relationship . These difference make it very difficult to predict how plant community will respond to elevated CO2 . Such information is critical to furthering our understanding of community and ecosystem response to global climate change . To determine how a simple plant community might respond to elevated CO2 , a model regenerating longleaf pine community composed of five specie wa exposed to two CO2 regime ( ambient , 365 mu mol mol ( -1 ) and elevated , 720 mu mol mol ( -1 ) ) for 3 yr. Total above- and belowground biomass wa 70 and 49 % greater , respectively , in CO2-enriched plot . Carbon ( C ) content followed a response pattern similar to biomass , resulting in a significant increase of 13.8 Mg C ha ( -1 ) under elevated CO2 . Responses of individual specie , however , varied . Longleaf pine ( Pinus palustris Mill . ) wa primarily responsible for the positive response to CO2 enrichment . Wiregrass ( Aristida stricta Michx . ) , rattlebox ( Crotalaria rotundifolia Walt . Ex Gruel . ) , and butterfly weed ( Asclepias tuberosa L. ) exhibited negative above- and belowground biomass response to elevated CO2 , while sand post oak ( Quercus margaretta Ashe ) did not differ significantly between CO2 treatment . As with pine , C content followed pattern similar to biomass . Elevated CO2 resulted in alteration in community structure . Longleaf pine comprised 88 % of total biomass in CO2-enriched plot , but only 76 % in ambient plot . In contrast , wire-grass , rattlebox , and butterfly weed comprised 19 % in ambient CO2 plot , but only 8 % under high CO2 . Therefore , while longleaf pine may perform well in a high CO2 world , other member of this community may not compete a well , which could alter community function . Effects of elevated CO2 on plant community are complex , dynamic , and difficult to predict , clearly demonstrating the need for more research in this important area of global change science .

aVThe continuous increase in the emission of greenhouse gas ha resulted in global warming , and substantial change in the global climate are expected by the end of the current century . The reduction in mass , volume , area and length of glacier on the global scale are considered a clear signal of a warmer climate . The increased rate of melting under a warmer climate ha resulted in the retreating of glacier . On the long-term scale , greater melting of glacier during the coming year could lead to the depletion of available water resource and influence water flow in river . It is also very likely that such change have occurred in Himalayan glacier , but might have gone unnoticed or not studied in detail . The water resource of the Himalayan region may also be highly vulnerable to such climate change , because more than 50 % of the water resource of India are located in the various tributary of the Ganges , Indus and the Brahmaputra river system , which are highly dependent on snow and glacier runoff . In the present study , the snowmelt model SNOWMOD ha been used to simulate the melt runoff from a highly glacierized small basin for the summer season . The model simulated the distribution and volume of runoff with reasonably good accuracy . Based on a 2-year simulation , it is found that , on average , the contribution of glacier melt and rainfall in the total runoff are 87 % and 13 % respectively . The impact of climate change on the monthly distribution of runoff and total summer runoff ha been studied with respect to plausible scenario of temperature and rainfall , both individually and in combined scenario . The analysis included six temperature scenario ranging between 0.5 and 3 degree C , and four rainfall scenario ( -10 % , -5 % , 5 % , 10 % ) . The combined scenario were generated using temperature and rainfall scenario . The combined scenario represented a combination of warmer and drier and a combination of warmer and wetter condition in the study area . The result indicate that , for the study basin , runoff increased linearly with increase in temperature and rainfall . For a temperature rise of 2 degree C , the increase in summer streamflow is computed to be about 28 % . Changes in rainfall by +/- 10 % resulted in corresponding change in streamflow by +/- 3.5 % . For the range of climatic scenario considered , the change in runoff are more sensitive to change in temperature , compared with rainfall , which is likely due to the major contribution of melt water in runoff . Such study are needed for proper assessment of available water resource under a changing climate in the Himalayan region . Copyright ( c ) 2005 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd .

aVRising level of atmospheric CO2 are thought to increase C sink in terrestrial ecosystem . The potential of these sink to mitigate CO2 emission , however , may be constrained by nutrient . By using metaanalysis , we found that elevated CO2 only cause accumulation of soil C when N is added at rate well above typical atmospheric N input . Similarly , elevated CO2 only enhances N-2 fixation , the major natural process providing soil N input , when other nutrient ( e.g. , phosphorus , molybdenum , and potassium ) are added . Hence , soil C sequestration under elevated CO2 is constrained both directly by IN availability and indirectly by nutrient needed to support N2 fixation .

aVThe Random Forests multiple-regression tree wa used to model climate profile of 25 biotic community of the western United States and nine of their constituent specie . Analyses of the community were based on a gridded sample of ca . 140,000 point , while those for the specie used presence-absence data from ca . 120,000 location . Independent variable included 35 simple expression of temperature and precipitation and their interaction . Classification error for community model averaged 19 % , but the error were reduced by half when adjusted for misalignment between geographic data set . Errors of omission for species-specific model approached 0 , while error of commission were le than 9 % . Mapped climate profile of the specie were in solid agreement with range map . Climate variable of most importance for segregating the community were those that generally differentiate maritime , continental , and monsoonal climate , while those of importance for predicting the occurrence of specie varied among specie but consistently implicated the periodicity of precipitation and temperature-precipitation interaction . Projections showed that unmitigated global warming should increase the abundance primarily of the montane forest and grassland community profile at the expense largely of those of the subalpine , alpine , and tundra community but also that of the arid woodland . However , the climate of 47 % of the future landscape may be extramural to contemporary community profile . Effects projected on the spatial distribution of species-specific profile were varied , but shift in space and attitude would be extensive . Species-specific projection were not necessarily consistent with those of their community .

aVUnderstanding the environmental burden from residential construction is increasingly important a consumer become more aware of the impact of their purchasing decision . In 2004 , The Consortium for Research on Renewable Industrial Materials ( CORRIM ) evaluated the life-cycle environmental impact of building material used in residential construction . This report build upon those finding by examining the environmental burden of each component used to construct wall and floor subassemblies in residential home . Evaluating component and subassemblies illuminates how the environmental burden from different product , design , and process compare . Summary performance measure were developed for fossil fuel energy requirement , global warming potential , air and water pollution , and solid waste . This study clearly show that the use of wood-based building material significantly reduces most environmental burden . The study also demonstrates the benefit of biofuels , recycling , and pre-cutting to reduce solid waste . This study 's significance is enhanced by the detailed insight it provides on how architect and product and process engineer can substantially reduce environmental burden .

aVLoss of soil organic carbon ( SOC ) can cause soil degradation , which may not only undermine soil productivity , but may also-affect environmental health . In China , a huge amount of crop residue is regularly removed from the field , and therefore China 's agriculture depends on high level of chemical fertilizer input . This paper aim to estimate the SOC storage in Chinese cropland , identify it changing trend under current cropping system , and finally put forward some strategy to keep the SOC in balance . A computer simulation model of carbon and nitrogen biogeochemistry in agro-ecosystems ( DeNitrification and DeComposition or DNDC ) wa applied to predict SOC dynamic in the upper ( 0-30 cm ) soil layer of agricultural ecosystem at national scale . Data on climate , soil property , cropping system , acreage , and management practice at county scale were collected from various source and integrated into a GIS database to support the model run . The model result revealed ( 1 ) the total SOC storage in croplands in China is about 3968 Tg C ; and ( 2 ) SOC is lost at a rate of 78.89 Tg C/year . The highest loss of SOC occur in the northeastern province . Chinese cropland soil release 186 Tg C a carbon dioxide into the atmosphere , and receive only 68 Tg C from crop residue annually . Considering the potential of global warming , SOC loss in cropland could be a serious contributor . Strategies to reduce the loss of SOC in Chinese cropland are proposed based on DNDC model run for a number of scenario under different management practice . ( c ) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

aVThis work study long-term rainfall variation in Taiwan and provides local climate change analysis to global climate change . Around a century of rainfall data from 33 rain-gauges populate the database used herein . Statistical test , such a cumulative deviation , Mann-Whitney-Pettitt statistic and the Kruskal-Wallis test , were first employed to determine whether annual rainfall series exhibit any regular trend . Analytical result indicate that the annual rainfall ha increased in northern Taiwan , declined in central and southern Taiwan , and exhibited no clear tendency in Eastern Taiwan . Almost all of these rainfall series changed significantly around 1960 , which date divide historical rainfall series into two sample group . This change in the seasonal rainfall wa further investigated .

aVIt is of utmost interest to further understand the mechanism behind the potential interaction or synergy between the greenhouse gas ( GHG ) forcing ( s ) , particularly a represented by CO2 , and water process and through different climatic scale down to the leaf scale . Toward this goal , the factor separation methodology introduced by Stein and Alpert [ Stein U. and Alpert , P. 1993 . Factor separation in numerical simulation , J. Atmos . Sci. , 50 , 2107-2115 . ] that allows an explicit separation of atmospheric synergy among different factor , is employed . Three independent experiment carried out recently by the present author , are reported here , all strongly suggest the existence of a significant CO2-water synergy in all the involved scale . The experiment employed a very wide range of up-to-date atmospheric model that complement the physic currently introduced in most Global Circulation Models ( GCMs ) for global climate change prediction . Three modeling experiment that go from the small/micro scale ( leaf scale and soil moisture ) to mesoscale ( land-use change and CO2 effect ) and to global scale ( greenhouse gas and cloudiness ) all show that synergy between water and CO2 are essential in predicting carbon assimilation , minimum daily temperature and the global Earth temperature , respectively . The study also highlight the importance of including the physic associated with carbon-water synergy which is mostly unresolved in global climate model suggesting that significant carbon-water interaction are not incorporated or at least well parameterized in current climate model . Hence , there is a need for integrative climate model . As shown in earlier study , the climate involves physical , chemical and biological process . To only include a subset of these process limit the skill of local , regional and global model to simulate the real climate system . In addition , our result provide explicit determination of the direct and the interactive effect of the CO2 response on the terrestrial biosphere response . There is also an implicit scale interactive effect that can be deduced from the multiscale effect discussed in the three example . Processes at each scale-leaf , regional and global will all synergistically contribute to increase the feedbacks-which can decrease or increase the overall system 's uncertainty depending on specific case/setup and need to be examined in future coupled , multiscale study .

aVThe potential role of the impact of land-cover change ( LCCs ) in the Australian climate is investigated within the context of increasing CO ( 2 ) concentration and temperature . Specifically , it is explored if possible scenario for LCC can moderate or amplify CO ( 2 ) -induced change in climate over Australia . The January climate of Australia is simulated under three different land-cover-change scenario using a high-resolution regional climate model . The land-cover-change scenario include a steady-state land cover that is equivalent to current land cover , a low-reforestation scenario that recovers approximately 25 % of the tree replaced by grassland within the last 200 yr , and a high-reforestation scenario that recovers at least 75 % of the deforested region . The model wa driven by boundary condition taken from transitory climate simulation from a general circulation model that included two climate scenario based on two projected scenario of CO ( 2 ) concentration increase . The result show that reforestation ha the potential to reduce the projected increase in Australian temperature in 2050 and 2100 by a much a 40 % and 20 % , respectively . This cooling effect , however , is highly localized and occurs only in region of reforestation . The result therefore hint that the potential of reforestation to moderate the impact of global warming may be significantly limited by the spatial scale of reforestation . In term of deforestation , result show that any future land clearing can exacerbate the projected warming in certain region of Australia . Carbon-related variable are also analyzed and result show that change in net CO ( 2 ) flux may be influenced more by soil respiration than by photosynthesis . The result herein encourage study on the inclusion of land-cover-change scenario in future climate change projection simulation of the Australian climate .

aVUnderstanding the time scale and pathway for response and recovery of river and floodplain to episodic change in erosion and sedimentation ha been a long standing issue in fluvial geomorphology . Floodplains are an important component of watershed system because they affect downstream storage and delivery of overbank flood water , and they also serve a source and temporary sink for sediment and toxic substance delivered by river system . Here , ( 14 ) C and ( 137 ) Cs isotopic dating method are used along with age of culturally related phenomenon associated with mining and agriculture to determine rate of sedimentation and morphologic change for a reach of the upper Mississippi River and adjacent tributary in southwestern Wisconsin and northwestern Illinois . The most important environmental change that influenced fluvial activity in this region during last 10,000 year involved the conversion of a late Holocene mosaic of prairie and forest to a landscape dominated by cropland and pastureland associated with Euro-American settlement . Results presented herein for the Upper Mississippi Valley ( UMV ) show that the shift from pre-agriculture , natural land cover to landscape dominance by agricultural land use of the last 175-200 year typically increased rate and magnitude of floodplain sedimentation by at least an order of magnitude . Accelerated overbank flooding led to increased bank height on tributary stream and , in turn , contributed to more frequent deep flow of high energy . These high energy flow subsequently promoted bank erosion and lateral channel migration , and the formation of a historical meander belt whose alluvial surface constitutes a new historical floodplain inset against the earlier historical floodplain . The new historical floodplain serf a a `` flume-like '' channel that provides efficient downstream transport of water and sediment associated with moderate and large magnitude flood . Floodplains on lower tributary , however , continue to experience rate of overbank sedimentation that are of anomalously high magnitude given improved land cover and land conservation since about 1950 . This lower valley anomaly is explained by minimal development of historical ( agriculture period ) meander belt because of relatively low stream power in these channel and floodplain reach of relatively low gradient . In general , long-term pre-agriculture rate of vertical accretion between about 10,000 and 200 year ago averaged about 0.2 mm yr ( -1 ) in tributary watershed smaller than about 700 km ( 2 ) and about 0.9 mm yr ( -1 ) on the floodplain of the upper Mississippi River where the contributing watershed area increase to about 170,000 km2 . On the other hand , rate of historical vertical accretion during the period of agricultural dominance of the last 200 year average between 2 and 20 mm yr ( -1 ) , with short episode of even higher rate during time of particularly poor land conservation practice . Significant hydrologic effect of mining and agricultural started by the 1820s and became widespread in the study region by the mid-19th century . The hydrologic and geomorphic influence of mining were relatively minor compared to those related to agriculture . High resolution dating of floodplain vertical accretion deposit show that large flood have frequently provided major increment of sedimentation on floodplain of tributary and the main valley upper Mississippi River . The relative importance of large flood a contributor to floodplain vertical accretion is noteworthy bcause global atmospheric circulation model indicate that the main channel upper Mississippi River should experience increased frequency of extreme hydrologic event , including large flood , with anticipated continued global warming . Instrumental and stratigraphic record show that , coincident with global warming , a shift to more frequent large flood occurred since 1950 on the upper Mississippi River , and these flood generally contributed high magnitude of floodplain sedimentation .

aVForests of the United States and Russia can play a positive role in reducing the extent of global warming caused by greenhouse gas , especially carbon dioxide . To determine the extent of carbon sequestration , physical , ecological , economic , and social issue need to be considered , including different forest management objective across major forest ownership group . Private timberland in the U.S. Pacific Northwest are relatively young , well stocked , and sequestering carbon at relatively high rate . Forests in northwestern Russia are generally le productive than those in the Northwestern U.S. but cover extensive area . A large increase in carbon storage per hectare in live tree biomass is projected on National Forest timberland in the U.S. Pacific Northwest for all selected scenario , with an increase of between 157-175 Mg by 2050 and a near doubling of 1970s level . On private timberland in the Pacific Northwest , average carbon in live tree biomass per hectare ha been declining historically but began to level off near 65 Mg in 2000 ; projected level by 2050 are roughly what they were in 1970 at approximately 80 Mg . In the St. Petersburg region , average carbon store were similar to those on private land in the Pacific Northwest : 57 Mg per hectare in 2000 and ranging from 40 to 64 Mg by 2050 . Although the projected future reflect a broad range of policy option , larger difference in projected carbon store result from the starting condition determined by ownership , regional environmental condition , and past change in forest management . However , an important change of forest management objective , such a the end of all timber harvest on National Forests in the Pacific Northwest or complete elimination of mature timber in the St. Petersburg region , can lead to substantial change in carbon store over the next 50 year .

aVData archive from four global coupled ocean-atmosphere model are used to construct map of diapycnal mass flux through selected isopycnal surface in the model ocean . The map illustrate location and strength of the up and downwelling limb of thermohaline-forced overturning loop whose stability in the face of rising atmospheric carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) concentration is of major concern in century-scale climate prediction . The up and downwelling limb simulated by the four model for present-day greenhouse gas concentration are compared with observational estimate . Predicted change in the overturning brought about by gradually rising atmospheric CO2 content are compared model-to-model . While all four model predict some decline in the rate of Atlantic overturning during CO2-induced global warming , the geographic layout of the overturning circulation in each model is found to be insensitive to the changing climate .

aVGlobal surface temperature ha increased approximate to 0.2 degree C per decade in the past 30 year , similar to the warming rate predicted in the 19805 in initial global climate model simulation with transient greenhouse gas change . Warming is larger in the Western Equatorial Pacific than in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific over the past century , and we suggest that the increased West-East temperature gradient may have increased the likelihood of strong El Ninos , such a those of 1983 and 1998 . Comparison of measured sea surface temperature in the Western Pacific with paleoclimate data suggests that this critical ocean region , and probably the planet a a whole , is approximately a warm now a at the Holocene maximum and within approximate to 1 degree C of the maximum temperature of the past million year . We conclude that global warming of more than approximate to 1 degree C , relative to 2000 , will constitute `` dangerous '' climate change a judged from likely effect on sea level and extermination of specie .

aVFuture global warming ha a number of implication for fluvial geomorphology because of change in such phenomenon a rate of evapotranspiration , precipitation characteristic , plant distribution , plant stomatal closure , sea level , glacier and permafrost melting , and human response . Potential change in river are outlined in this review in the context of change in the intensity of rainfall , the activity of tropical cyclone , runoff response ( including that of Europe , dry land and high latitude environment ) , and geomorphological reaction , including rate of soil erosion . In general , however , much work remains to be done to establish the full range of geomorphological response that may take place in fluvial system . ( c ) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All right reserved .

aVGlobal warming can affect the world 's biota and the functioning of ecosystem in many indirect way . Recent evidence indicates that climate change can alter the geographical distribution of parasitic disease , with potentially drastic consequence for their host . It is also possible that warmer condition could promote the transmission of parasite and raise their local abundance . Here I have compiled experimental data on the effect of temperature on the emergence of infective stage ( cercaria ) of trematode parasite from their snail intermediate host . Temperature-mediated change in cercarial output varied widely among trematode specie , from small reduction to 200-fold increase in response to a 10 degree C rise in temperature , with a geometric mean suggesting an almost 8-fold increase . Overall , the observed temperature-mediated increase in cercarial output are much more substantial than those expected from basic physiological process , for which 2- to 3-fold increase are normally seen . Some of the most extreme increase in cercarial output may be artefact of the method used in the original study ; however , exclusion of these extreme value ha little impact on the preceding conclusion . Across both specie value and phylogenetically independent contrast , neither the magnitude of the initial cercarial output nor the shell size of the snail host correlated with the relative increase in cercarial production mediated by rising temperature . In contrast , the latitude from which the snail-trematode association originated correlated negatively with temperature-mediated increase in cercarial production : within the 20 degree to 55 degree latitude range , trematode from lower latitude showed more pronounced temperature-driven increase in cercarial output than those from higher latitude . These result suggest that the small increase in air and water temperature forecast by many climate model will not only influence the geographical distribution of some disease , but may also promote the proliferation of their infective stage in many ecosystem .

aVThis study investigates the amenity value of climate to British household . By using the hedonic price approach , the marginal willingness to pay for small change in climate variable is derived . Various index of temperature and precipitation are used including mean , range , extreme and January and July average . We specify one hedonic regression including information on house price and wage data for 755 Posttowns and found the model containing January and July average of temperature and precipitation most appropriate . The estimate suggest that British people would typically prefer higher temperature in January . Increased precipitation in January is likely to reduce welfare . Changes in temperature and precipitation in July are not significant . Limited global warming , with a more pronounced effect of temperature increase compared to higher precipitation level during winter month , might thus benefit British household .

aVWe can precisely predict the future dynamic of population only if we know the underlying mechanism of population dynamic . Long-term data are important for the elucidation of such mechanism . In this article we analyze the 50-year dynamic of annual light-trap catch of three insect pest specie living in paddy field in Japan : the rice stem borer , Chilo suppressalis ( Walker ) ( Lepidoptera : Pyralidae ) ; the green rice leafhopper , Nephotettix cincticeps ( Uhler ) ( Hemiptera : Deltocephalidae ) ; and the small brown planthopper , Laodelphax striatellus ( Fallen ) ( Hemiptera : Delphacidae ) . We separate the long-term dynamic into two component by using locally weighted scatterplot smoothing : ( 1 ) the underlying dynamic of population , and ( 2 ) the influence of the past change in the environment . The former component is analyzed by response surface analysis and vector autoregression to evaluate the nonlinearity of density-dependence and the inter-specific influence of density , respectively . On the basis of these analysis , we perform the state-space model analysis . The state-space model selected by Akaike 's information criterion indicates that the observed number of light-trap catch of C. suppressalis and N. cincticeps in summer increase with increasing temperature in the previous winter . It also indicates that the influence of temperature is not carried over to the next year . We utilize the selected model to predict the impact of global warming on these specie , by substituting the temperature predicted by a general circulation model .

aVGoal , Scope and Background . This paper is concerned with a life cycle assessment ( LCA ) and life cycle costing ( LCQ by the use of the waste input-output ( WIO ) quantity- and price model of air conditioner with different energy efficiency at the use phase ( high-end , lowend and average model ) that were available in Japan a of winter 2002 . The functional unit is an air conditioner of the 2.5kW type that is used for 10 year , and then subjected to an end-of-life ( EoL ) process that is consistent with the Japanese law on the recycling of appliance . Methods . This is the first simultaneous application of the WIO methodology to an LCA and LCC over the entire life-cycle of a product including the use phase , and represents a methodological extension ( in the sense of considering the use phase ) and integration ( in the sense of a simultaneous application ) of previous study by u ( Kondo and Nakamura , Int J LCA 2004 , Nakamura and Kondo , Ecol Econ 2006 ) . The main body of data is provided by the WIO table for the year 2000 , an update of the previous table for 1995 that wa used in the above WIO study . Compared with the WIO table for 1995 that consisted of only about 80 industry sector , the current one consists of about 400 industry sector , and includes air conditioner a a separate sector . The data on the purchase price and efficiency of air conditioner indicate wide variation : the cheapest one ( the lowend model ) cost half of the most expensive one ( the high-end model ) , but it efficiency is about half of the latter . Results and Discussion . When the cost in the use and EoL phase is included , the low-end model becomes the most expensive one , and the high-end model with the highest purchase cost the least expensive . This reversal of the relative cost level is attributed to the difference in the efficiency in the use phase . A sensitivity analysis indicates that a reduction of the electricity price in the use phase by about 40 % doe not alter the significant superiority of the high-end model over the low-end model . In spite of the largest amount of input in the production phase , the high-end model performs the best in term of both global warming potential ( GWP ) and landfill , while the low-end model performs the worst . The use phase generates the largest amount of waste for landfill across the three model , the largest component of which is flyash generated from coal firing power plant . A possible internalization of externality in the form of carbon tax wa found to work in favor of the high-end model . The cost advantage of the high-end model , however , is sensitive to the rate of discounting of future cost : discounting at 15 % diminishes it advantage over the low-end model . Recommendation and Perspective . The result indicate the effectiveness of the pricing based on the life cycle cost for achieving sustainability , that is , for promoting the shift of the demand away from appliance with low environmental performance to the one with higher environmental performance . Acceptance by society of pricing based on life cycle costing would require , among other thing , an economywide standardization of the LCC concept ( in a manner analogous to ISO-LCA ) that can be used complementary to ISO-LCA .

aVImpact of global warming on the East Asian Winter Monsoon ( EAWM ) is studied using nine coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model ( AOGCMs ) . Models are mostly successful in simulating the basic feature of the EAWM with varied location of monsoon northwesterlies ( NW ) . Under the global warming scenario , most model show a weakening of the EAWM accompanied by a strong anticyclonic anomaly over the North Pacific corresponding to a weakened and/or the northern shift of the Aleutian Low ( AL ) . Response in Sea Level Pressure ( SLP ) also show the weakening of both the AL and the Siberian High ( SH ) , which give rise to a weakened pressure gradient along the eastern coast of the Eurasian continent . Among other factor , weakening of the tropical local Hadley circulation wa found to substantially weaken the East Asian Jet ( EAJ ) and the resultant EAWM .

aVThere are numerous mid-sized city in the developing world and most of them lack effective urban management and transportation policy . Though city effort to reduce global warming potential ( GWP ) emission may be low in the global context , effective transportation policy in city will have obvious result . Taking the Kathmandu Valley a a case study , this paper make an attempt to analyse the implication of different transportation policy for reducing vehicular emission and energy consumption . This paper estimate and analysis current and future trend of energy demand and environmental emission , especially CO2 and PM10 from passenger road transportation in the Kathmandu Valley . The study is based on the primary data collected at the busiest and longest inner city road . It us the long range energy alternative planning system framework to construct future scenario up to 2025 . It analysis future scenario implication mainly dealing with the introduction of trolley bus , promotion of public transportation , discouraging private vehicle and low occupancy public vehicle , increasing vehicular speed , and other transportation policy . The study estimated that the 637 million passenger-kilometres traveled in the study route during 2004 resulted in 34.8 million kg of CO2 emission . The travel demand is estimated to multiply by 7.8 with a corresponding twelve-fold increase in CO2 emission and a ten-fold increase in total suspended particle ( TSP ) emission in the study route from 2004 to 2024 under a non-intervention scenario . This scenario analysis suggests that discouraging private vehicle , thereby promoting mass transportation operated by electricity , can reduce CO2 by 43.7 % and TSP by 43.8 % compared with a scenario of non-intervention . In addition to transportation policy , effective land-use planning and encouragement of non-motorised transport can have more positive impact . Since Nepal is the Himalayan Kingdom , having many glacier and snow-fed river , it is in great risk of global warming . Therefore change should begin immediately .

aVOpen Top Chambers ( OTCs ) were used to measure impact of predicted global warming on the structure of the invertebrate community of a Dryas octopetala heath in West Spitsbergen . Results from the OTC experiment were compared with natural variation in invertebrate community structure along a snowmelt transect through similar vegetation up the adjacent hillside . Changes along this transect represent the natural response of the invertebrate community to progressively longer and potentially warmer and drier growing season . Using MANOVA , ANOVA , Linear Discriminant Analysis and chi ( 2 ) test , significant difference in community composition were found between OTCs and control and among station along the transect . Numbers of cryptostigmatic and predatory mite tended to be higher in the warmer OTC treatment but number of the aphid Acyrthosiphon svalbardicum , hymenopterous parasitoids , Symphyta larva , and weevil were higher in control plot . Most Collembola , including Hypogastrura tullbergi , Lepidocyrtus lignorum and Isotoma anglicana , followed a similar trend to the aphid , but Folsomia bisetosa wa more abundant in the OTC treatment . Trends along the transect showed clear parallel with the OTC experiment . However , mite specie , particularly Diapterobates notatus , tended to increase in number under warming , with several specie collectively increasing at the earlier exposed transect station . Overall , the result suggest that the composition and structure of Arctic invertebrate community associated with Dryas will change significantly under global warming .

Laboratory study have indicated that plant oil with antimicrobial activity can be used to control pathogen and odor emission from cattle and swine waste . However , these oil are aromatic and may volatilize when applied topically . Our objective were to evaluate the volatility of thymol from a feedlot surface and the effectiveness of topically applying thyme oil ( 2.5 % thymol ) , incorporated into corncob granule and added once per week , to control odor emission and total coliforms in feedlot manure . In the first study , thymol either volatilized or wa degraded within 28 d after topical application . In a second study , thyme oil ( 2.5 % thymol ) wa incorporated into corncob and applied to pen surface weekly . Manure sample from 6 location in each pen were collected from 3 untreated and 3 thymol-corncob-treated pen ( 15 x 150 m ; fifty 400-kg cattle/pen ) , 3 time per week for 8 wk . Samples were analyzed for thymol concentration , total VFA , branched-chain VFA , aromatic compound , and the number of Escherichia coli and total coliform bacteria . Over the 8 wk , with the exception of wk 7 , the desired thymol concentration of 15 to 20 mu mol/g DM wa maintained in the manure . Concentrations of VFA and branched chain-VFA increased over time in untreated and treated pen . However , the rate of VFA accumulation in treated pen ( 7.5 +/- 1.3 mu mol center dot g DM ( -1 . ) wk ( -1 ) ) wa le ( P < 0.01 ) than the rate of accumulation in untreated pen ( 18.0 +/- 2.1 mu mol ( . ) g DM ( -1. ) wk ( -1 ) ) . Likewise , the rate of branched-chain VFA accumulation in treated pen ( 0.31 +/- 0.04 mu mol ( . ) g DM ( -1 . ) wk ( -1 ) ) wa le ( P < 0.01 ) than in untreated pen ( 0.55 +/- 0.06 mu mol ( . ) g DM ( -1. ) wk ( -1 ) ) . The concentration of E. coli in treated pen ( 2.9 +/- 1.2 x 10 ( 5 ) cfu ( . ) g DM-1 ) were 91 % le ( P < 0.04 ) than in untreated pen ( 31.1 +/- 4.0 x 10 ( 5 ) cfu ( . ) g DM-1 ) . Similarly , concentration of coliforms in treated pen ( 3.7 +/- 1.3 x 10 ( 5 ) cfu ( . ) g DM-1 ) were 89 % le ( P < 0.04 ) than those of untreated pen ( 35.3 +/- 4.2 x 10 ( 5 ) cfu ( . ) g DM-1 ) . These result indicate that odor emission and total coliforms can be reduced in feedlot manure with a once per week application of thymol incorporated in a granular form . However , corncob are bulky , and other granular carrier with a greater carrying capacity for thyme oil should be explored .

aVGlobal warming is becoming a reality , with growing evidence that anthropogenic activity on our planet is starting to influence our climate ( IPCC , 2001 ) . Due to the increase in significant weather-related disaster in recent year , it is important to investigate the role of global warming on such change . In this paper we attempt to estimate the long term trend in lightning activity over tropical Africa during the past 50 year , using upper tropospheric water vapor a a proxy for regional lightning activity . We use the NCAR/NCEP reanalysis product available for the period 1948 to the present to estimate the long term trend in lightning activity . Similarity between the long term African lightning variability and observed rainfall and river discharge variability are demonstrated . Since 1950 the inferred lightning activity over Africa show significant variability , reaching a maximum during the 1960s , followed by a decrease in activity during the following 30 year .

aVRecent global climate model simulation for the IPCC Fourth Assessment report show a realistic North Pacific storm track and Aleutian Low for present-day climate condition . Under climate change , the storm track and Aleutian Low move northward and intensify . These change shift precipitation northward along the Pacific coast of North America . In particular , precipitation is intensified over the Pacific Northwest . Results from a statistical downscaling model suggest that precipitation may become more intense both due to the increased frequency of large-scale storm and due to change in the interaction of these storm with the local terrain .

aVThe vulnerability of the built environment will be influenced by global-scale climate change . However , there are large uncertainty associated with the future performance of building due : to change in regional- and local-scale climatic impact . The use of modern risk-management theory is discussed for developing cross-disciplinary strategy to meet the challenge of future climate change . It is shown that there are benefit to be gained from the introduction of risk-management strategy within a greater extent of the construction industry . Cross-disciplinary risk-based management strategy ( ensuring cooperation along vertical decision-making line ) , together with design guideline that account for both historical local climatic condition and scenario for future change , can be an important step towards a more active and dynamic way of ensuring a high-quality construction process and a sustainable built environment . Reducing the potential for defect or damage through the development of technical and organizational preventive measure ( a risk-based management strategy ) while at the same time applying the precautionary principle and discursive strategy in the design , construction and geographical localization of building , is likely to increase the robustness of the built environment in the light of the unknown risk of future climate change .

aVIncreasing atmospheric carbon dioxide is responsible for climate change that are having widespread effect on biological system . One of the dearest change is earlier onset of spring and lengthening of the growing season . We designed the present study to examine the interactive effect of timing of dormancy release of seed with low and high atmospheric CO2 on biomass , reproduction , and phenology in ragweed plant ( Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. ) , which produce highly allergenic pollen . We released ragweed seed from dormancy at three 15-day interval and grew plant in climate-controlled glasshouse at either ambient or 700-ppm CO2 concentration , placing open-top bag over inflorescence to capture pollen . Measurements of plant height and weight ; inflorescence number , weight , and length ; and day to anthesis and anthesis date were made on each plant , and whole-plant pollen productivity wa estimated from an allometric-based model . Timing and CO2 interacted to influence pollen production . At ambient CO2 level , the earlier cohort acquired a greater biomass , a higher average weight per inflorescence , and a larger number of inflorescence ; flowered earlier ; and had 54.8 % greater pollen production than did the latest cohort . At high CO2 level , plant showed greater biomass and reproductive effort compared with those in ambient CO2 but only for later cohort . In the early cohort , pollen production wa similar under ambient and high CO2 , but in the middle and late cohort , high CO2 increased pollen production by 32 % and 55 % , respectively , compared with ambient CO2 level . Overall , ragweed pollen production can be expected to increase significantly under predicted future climate condition .

aVWe have obtained a high-resolution oxygen isotopic record of cave calcite from Caverna Botuvera ( 27 degree 13 'S , 49 degree 09'W ) , southern Brazil , which cover most of the last 36 thousand year ( ka ) , with an average resolution of a few to several decade . The chronology wa determined with 46 U/Th age from two stalagmite . Tests for equilibrium condition show that oxygen isotopic variation are primarily caused by climate change . We interpret our record in term of meteoric precipitation change , hence the variability of South American Monsoon ( SAM ) intensity . The oxygen isotopic profile broadly follows local insolation change and show clear millennial-scale variation during the last glacial period with amplitude a large a 3 part per thousand but with smaller centennial-scale shift ( < 1 part per thousand ) during the Holocene . The overall record is strikingly similar to , but strongly anti-correlated with , a number of record from the Northern Hemisphere . We compared our record to other precisely dated contemporaneous record from Hulu Cave eastern China . Minima in 6180 ( wet period , intense SAM ) at our site are synchronous with maximum in delta O-18 ( dry period , weak East Asian Monsoon , EAM ) in eastern China ( within precise dating error ) and vice versa . This anti-phased precipitation relationship between two low-latitude location may be interhemispheric in extent , based on comparison with record from other site . Precipitation anti-phasing may be related to north-south shift in the mean position of the intertropical convergence zone ( ITCZ ) and asymmetry in Hadley circulation in two hemisphere , associated not with seasonal change a observed today , but with millennial-scale climate shift . The millennial-scale atmospheric see-saw pattern that we observe could have important control and feedback on climate within hemisphere because of water vapor 's greenhouse property .

aVSpecies invasion have been a central theme in ecology over the past decade , with a focus on invasion of non-indigenous European specie in the New World . However , within Europe , native specie may also become invasive . Such specie rapidly increase their geographic range and may at the same time broaden their ecological amplitude . We report on Lactuca serriola L. , which ha shown a rapid range expansion in many part of Europe . We reconstructed it geographical spread through The Netherlands ; furthermore , we tested for change in it ecological amplitude . Before 1950 , L. serriola wa rare in The Netherlands , recorded from only 80 grid-cells ( of 5 x 5 km ( 2 ) ) . Subsequently , it distribution increased from 219 grid-cells ( 1980 ) , to 546 cell ( 990 ) and 998 grid cell ( 2000 ) . It currently occupies at least 60 % of The Netherlands . Analyses of relevees demonstrate , using detrended correspondence analysis ( DCA ) , that the variance in the assemblage of specie co-occurring with L. serriola increased significantly since 1940 , indicating that the specie currently occurs in a broader range of vegetation type . Correlating average of Ellenberg 's indicator value per vegetation relevee with time , we found correlation for continentality ( + ) , acidity ( - ) and ( soil ) humidity ( + ) . Moreover , the proportion of phanerophytes in the relevees increased over time . These finding suggest that in addition to it original ruderal . habitat , L. serriola also currently occurs , in more closed vegetation type . Based on analysis of two other co-occurring Asteraceae specie , we showed that these pattern were specific for L. serriola only . We conclude that L. serriola ha broadened it ecological amplitude and discus four mutually non-exclusive explanation for the recent invasiveness of L. serriola : ( i ) Effects of a changed environment : global . warming and ruderalisation ; ( ii ) metapopulation dynamic and increased diaspore pressure ; ( iii ) microevolution ; IN ) genetic reinforcement due to hybridisation with conspecific ( crop ) specie .

aVThe outlet from the limestone treated Lake Terjevann consisted mainly of well-mixed lake water ( mean pH 6.1 ) during the ice-free season including the unusually warm winter of 1992 and 1993 . However , during the ice-covered period acidic water ( mean pH 4.8 , mean inorganic aluminium ( Al-i ) about 160 mu g/l ) from the catchment draining under the lake ice dominated . A downstream tributary wa generally acid and rich in aluminium ( mean pH 4.6 , Al-i about 230 mu g/l ) . After an extreme rainstorm loaded with sea-salts cation exchange in the soil resulted in more than a doubling of the Ali concentration ( reaching about 500 mu g/l ) . It took 3-4 month until the Ali concentration returned to pre-event level . During the ice-covered period , the acidic outlet and tributary water resulted in acidic condition below the confluence ( pH 5.2 , Al-i about 95 mu g/l ) . However , during the latter climatic condition the water wa most probably more harmful to fish due to hydrolysing and polymerizing aluminium . After the sea-salt event , the increased Ali concentration in the tributary made the zone below the confluence potentially more toxic ( PH similar to 5 , Al-i similar to 250 mu g/l ) . Expected global warming resulting in winter mean temperature above 0 degree C may eliminate the seasonal acidification of the outlet from limestone-treated lake creating permanent toxic mixing zone in the confluence below acidic aluminium-rich tributary . Besides , more frequent rainstorm a a consequence of global warming may increase the frequency of sea-salt event and the Ali concentration in the mixing zone . ( c ) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

aVThe response of the ecosystem along the 0 degree C mean annual isotherm to global climate change are intense and involve significant change in land cover at the water shed scale . This paper evaluates change in land cover in the center of Qinghai-Tibet , the headwater region of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers , on the basis of two set of remote sensing data ( 1986 and 2000 ) and field investigation . Over a period of 15 year , 23 % and 34 % of alpine cold swamp were recently turned into alpine cold meadow or alpine cold steppe , and decreased in area by 25.9 % and 42.7 % in the headwater area of the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers , respectively . Moreover , more than 20 % of high-coverage alpine cold meadow and alpine cold steppe were converted to lower-coverage alpine cold meadow ( vegetation coverage > 80 % ) and alpine cold steppe ( vegetation coverage > 50 % ) . Desertified land increased by 18.4 % ( bare rock and sparse land ) and 31.1 % ( sandy land ) in the headwater area of the Yellow River and by 17.8 % -18.5 % in the headwater area of the Yangtze River . Land cover change in this region involves a complex transition between land cover type , which have a great influence on soil nutrient and the soil organic carbon ( SOC ) pool . Land cover change in the study area over the 15-year study period led to the loss of 336.6 Gg of SOC , of which 61.6 % were lost by alpine cold swamp transformation , and a total nitrogen ( N ) loss of 26.9 Gg , of which 81.9 % occurred in the headwater area of the Yangtze River . The change in the carbon and nitrogen cycle have serious implication for greenhouse gas emission due to land cover change caused by climate warming in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau .

aVIncreasing greenhouse gas concentration are expected to enhance the interannual variability of summer climate in Europe ( 1-3 ) and other mid-latitude region ( 4,5 ) , potentially causing more frequent heatwaves ( 1,3,5,6 ) . Climate model consistently predict an increase in the variability of summer temperature in these area , but the underlying mechanism responsible for this increase remain uncertain . Here we explore these mechanism using regional simulation of recent and future climatic condition with and without land - atmosphere interaction . Our result indicate that the increase in summer temperature variability predicted in central and eastern Europe is mainly due to feedback between the land surface and the atmosphere . Furthermore , they suggest that land - atmosphere interaction increase climate variability in this region because climatic regime in Europe shift northward in response to increasing greenhouse gas concentration , creating a new transitional climate zone with strong land - atmosphere coupling in central and eastern Europe . These finding emphasize the importance of soil- moisture - temperature feedback ( in addition to soil- moisture - precipitation feedback ( 7-10 ) ) in influencing summer climate variability and the potential migration of climate zone with strong land - atmosphere coupling ( 7,11 ) a a consequence of global warming . This highlight the crucial role of land atmosphere interaction in future climate change .

aVA comparative life cycle assessment ( LCA ) of two solar-driven advanced oxidation process , namely heterogeneous semiconductor photocatalysis and homogeneous photo-Fenton , both coupled to biological treatment , is carried out in order to identify the environmentally preferable alternative to treat industrial wastewater containing nonbiodegradable priority hazardous substance . The study is based on solar pilot plant test using alpha-methyl-phenylglycine a a target substance . The LCA study is based on the experimental result obtained , along with data from an industrial-scale plant . The system under study includes production of the plant infrastructure , chemical , electricity , transport of all these material to the plant site , management of the spent catalyst by transport and landfilling , a well a treatment of the biodegradable effluent obtained in a conventional municipal wastewater treatment plant , and excess sludge treatment by incineration . Nine environmental impact category are included in the LCA : global warming , ozone depletion , human toxicity , freshwater aquatic toxicity , photochemical ozone formation , acidification , eutrophication , energy consumption , and land use . The experimental result obtained in the pilot plant show that solar photo-Fenton is able to obtain a biodegradable effluent much faster than solar heterogeneous photocatalysis , implying that the latter would require a much larger solar collector area in an industrial application . The result of the LCA show that , an industrial wastewater treatment plant based on heterogeneous photocatalysis involves a higher environmental impact than the photo-Fenton alternative , which display impact score 80-90 % lower in most impact category assessed . These result are mainly due to the larger size of the solar collector field needed by the plant . ( c ) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVBackground , Aims and Scope . Telecommunication and information technology , dramatically emerged during the last decade , ha generated environmental problem by accelerating mass production , mass consumption , and mass disposal of personal computer ( PCs ) in Korea . In addition , it ha led the Korean new economy . The Korean government ha encouraged researcher and industry to study the environmental impact , adequate disposal treatment , and the reasonable recycling rate of an end-of-life personal computer . The main purpose of this research is to investigate the life cycle environmental impact of PCs and to determine the desirable or feasible recycle rate of in end-of-life PC . An LCA on a PC wa performed based on different recycling scenario . Target audience are new product developer , designer , product recovery manager and environmental policy maker who are interested in the environmental impact of PCs and recycling of end-of-life product . Methods . A target product is a Pentium W personal computer made in Korea in 2001 , excluding the monitor and peripheral equipment . The procedure of the LCA followed the ISO14040 series . System boundary includes the entire life cycle of the product , including pre-manufacturing ( the electrical part and component manufacturing ) , manufacturing , transportation , use , and disposal . The LCI and impact assessment database for a PC wa constructed using SIMAPRO version 4.0 software and LCI information wa compiled by site-specific data and the Korean national database . The LCA wa performed on different recycling scenario : one being that of the current recycling rate of 46 % , and the other being the ideal condition of a 100 % recycling rate . Results and Discussion . Abiotic depletion , global warming , ecotoxicity , human toxicity , acidification , ozone layer depletion , photo-oxidant formation , and eutrophication are adopted a the impact category . The pre-manufacturing stage wa a significant stage for all of the environmental parameter , besides human toxicity potential . PC manufacturing consists of rather simple process such a assembly and packaging . For improving the environmental performance of PCs , environmental management approach of design for the environment and green procurement are recommended . The use stage had a significant potential due to the electricity consumption produced by burning fossil fuel . The disposal stage 's contribution to environmental impact wa largest in human toxicity , and second largest in ozone layer depletion potential . The PC recycling wa shown to inhibit all environmental impact with the exception of the ozone depletion and ecotoxicity potential . The increase of light oil , nitric acid , sulfuric acid , and deoxidating agent consumption during the recycling process contributes to the environmental impact of ozone and ecotoxicity parameter . Current recovery and recycling technology should be taken into account for enhancing the benefit of recycling . Anyway , the effectiveness of recycling wa highlighted by this study . PC recycling reduces the total environmental impact of the product . The PC recycling is recommended to be raised up to at least 63 % in order to reduce the environmental burden of a PC in other life cycle stage . Conclusion and Recommendation . This study implies that design for the environment ( DfE ) in the product design stage and green procurement are recommended for improving the entire environmental performance of electronic equipment such a PCs . The recycling of waste PCs clearly reduces the environmental burden . There are , however , trade-off among environmental parameter according to the PC recycling rate . Current recycling method are not effective in reducing ozone depletion and ecotoxicity environmental impact . The product recovery is another key for efficient recycling . Efficient reverse logistics to collect and transport end-of-life PCs should be taken into account to enhance recycling effect . There were several electrical part not included in this assessment , due to the unavailability of adequate data . Further study with more detail and reliable inventory for electrical part and sub-components are recommended . Furthermore , cost of recycling should also be treated in further research .

aVA life cycle assessment ( LCA ) of one proposed method of hydrogen production-the high temperature electrolysis of water vapor-is presented in this paper . High temperature electrolysis offer an advantage of higher energy efficiency over the conventional low-temperature alkaline electrolysis due to reduced cell potential and consequent electrical energy requirement . The primary energy source for the electrolysis will be advanced nuclear reactor operating at temperature corresponding to those required for the high temperature electrolysis . The LCA examines the environmental impact of the combined advanced nuclear-hi h temperature electrolysis plant , focusing upon quantifying the emission of carbon dioxide , sulfur dioxide , and nitrogen oxide per kilogram of hydrogen produced . The result are presented in term of the global warming potential ( GWP ) and the acidification potential ( AP ) of the system . The GWP for the system is 2000g carbon dioxide equivalent and the AP , 0.15g equivalent of hydrogen ion equivalent per kilogram of hydrogen produced . The GWP and AP of this process are one-sixth and one-third . respectively , of those for the hydrogen production by steam reforming of natural gas , and are comparable to producing hydrogen from wind- or hydro-electricity powered conventional electrolysis .

aVA life cycle assessment ( LCA ) is performed in this study in order to evaluate the environmental implication of the management of the fermentable fraction of waste in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area ( BMA ) , comparing the present management system with the system proposed for the future . The energy and water consumption were quantified , a well a the used area and the emission to the atmosphere and water . The software TRACI wa used in order to ass the potential impact on the category of acidification , eutrophication , toxicity and harm to the human health ( under the criterion of cancer , non-cancer and pollutant ) , global warming , depletion of the ozone layer , formation of photochemical smog , water use , land use and fossil fuel use . The result show that the management system proposed for the future reduces 7 out of the 12 potential impact analyzed , due mainly to the change in the technology of landfill ( baling-wrapping landfill ) . However , this system requires of further research to ass the impact on a long term . The worst option for biowaste management is the traditional landfill , based on the multibarrier concept . The result of this work suggest that the future biowaste management system is better in environmental term than the present system . ( c ) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All right reserved .

aVWe present the first continent-wide analysis of the population trend of European breeding bird to show that population of Afro-Palearctic migrant bird have shown a pattern of sustained , often severe , decline . The mean trend of inter-continental migrant wa significantly negative between 1970 and 1990 and non-significantly so between 1990 and 2000 . Mean population trend were positively correlated between period , suggesting little change in the trajectory of most migrant specie ' population over this 30-year period . In both period , trend of inter-continental migrant were significantly more negative than those of short-distance migrant or resident . This negative trend appeared to be largely , although not entirely , due to decline in specie wintering in dry , open habitat in Africa . Analyses of trend of 30 closely related pair of specie , one a long-distance migrant and the other not , indicated significantly more negative trend in the former , irrespective of breeding habitat . Conservation action to address these decline is required under the Convention on Migratory Species and the Pan-European Biological and Landscape Diversity Strategy , to which most European country are signatory and which aim , respectively , to conserve migratory specie and to halt the loss of biodiversity by 2010 . Our result indicate that more conservation action may be required outside Europe to achieve these target . Further research is needed to ass whether the decline are caused by factor operating on the bird ' wintering ground , breeding ground or on migration route , and to identify way to reverse them .

aVUnderstanding El Nino/Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) and it biological consequence is hindered by a lack of high-resolution , long-term data from the tropical western Pacific . We describe a preliminary , 6 year dataset that show tightly coupled ENSO-related bio-physical dynamic in a seawater lake in Palau , Micronesia . The lake is more strongly stratified during La Nina than El Nino condition , temperature anomaly in the lake co-vary strongly with the Nino 3.4 climate index , and the abundance of the dominant member of the pelagic community , an endemic subspecies of zooxanthellate jellyfish , is temperature associated . These result have broad relevance because the lake : ( i ) illustrates an ENSO signal that is partly obscured in surrounding semi-enclosed lagoon water and , therefore , ( ii ) may provide a model system for studying the effect of climate change on community evolution and cnidarian-zooxanthellae symbioses , which ( iii ) should be traceable throughout the Holocene because the lake harbour a high quality sediment record ; the sediment record should ( iv ) provide a sensitive and regionally unique record of Holocene climate relevant to predicting ENSO response to future global climate change and , finally , ( v ) seawater lake ecosystem elsewhere in the Pacific may hold similar potential for past , present , and predictive measurement of climate variation and ecosystem response .

aVAnaerobic digestion of source-separated municipal organic waste is considered feasible in Denmark . The limited hydraulic retention in the biogas reactor ( typically 15 d ) doe not allow full degradation of the organic waste . Storage of anaerobically digested municipal organic waste can therefore be a source of methane ( CH4 ) emission that may contribute significantly to the potential global warming impact from the waste treatment system . This study provides a model for quantifying the CH4 production from stored co-digested municipal organic waste and estimate the production under typical Danish climatic condition , thus quantifying the potential global warming impact from storage of the digested municipal organic waste before it use on agricultural land . Laboratory batch test on CH4 production a well a temperature measurement in eight full-scale storage tank provided data for developing a model estimating the CH4 production in storage tank containing digested municipal organic waste . The temperature measured in separate storage tank on farm receiving digested slurry were linearly correlated with air temperature . In storage tank receiving slurry directly from biogas reactor , significantly higher temperature were measured due to the high temperature of the effluent from the reactor . Storage tank on Danish farm are typically emptied in April and have a constant inflow of digested material . During the warmest month the content of digested material is therefore low , which limit the yearly CH4 production from storage .

aV[ 1 ] Methyl iodide concentration of up to 45 pmol L-1 , which flux into the marine boundary layer , have been found in low latitude water of the Atlantic and Indian ocean . These high concentration correlate well with the abundance of Prochlorococcus , and we have confirmed the release of methyl iodide by this specie in laboratory culture experiment . Extrapolating , we estimate the global ocean flux of iodine to the marine boundary layer from this single source to be 5.3 x 10 ( 11 ) g I yr ( -1 ) , which is a large fraction of the previously estimated total global flux and the implication are far reaching . Climate prediction model suggest increase in sea surface temperature and change in biogeographical provenance in response to global warming . Such change are likely to increase the abundance of Prochlorococcus , and we estimate a concomitant similar to 15 % increase in the release of iodine specie to the atmosphere . Potentially , this could help mitigate global warming .

aVCarbonate crust in marine environment can act a sink for carbon dioxide . Therefore , understanding carbonate crust formation could be important for understanding global warming . In the present study , the microbial community of three carbonate crust sample from deep-sea mud volcano in the eastern Mediterranean were characterized by sequencing 16S ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) gene amplified from DNA directly retrieved from the sample . In combination with the mineralogical composition of the crust and lipid analysis , sequence data were used to ass the possible role of prokaryote in crust formation . Collectively , the obtained data showed the presence of highly diverse community , which were distinct in each of the carbonate crust studied . Bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequence were found in all crust and the majority wa classified a alpha- , gamma- , and delta- Proteobacteria . Interestingly , sequence of Proteobacteria related to Halomonas and Halovibrio sp. , which can play an active role in carbonate mineral formation , were present in all crust . Archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequence were retrieved from two of the crust studied . Several of those were closely related to archaeal sequence of organism that have previously been linked to the anaerobic oxidation of methane ( AOM ) . However , the majority of archaeal sequence were not related to sequence of organism known to be involved in AOM . In combination with the strongly negative delta C-13 value of archaeal lipid , these result open the possibility that organism with a role in AOM may be more diverse within the Archaea than previously suggested . Different community found in the crust could carry out similar process that might play a role in carbonate crust formation .

aVA new Earth system model , GENIE-1 , is presented which comprises a 3-D frictional geostrophic ocean , phosphate-restoring marine biogeochemistry , dynamic and thermodynamic sea-ice , land surface physic and carbon cycling , and a seasonal 2-D energy-moisture balance atmosphere . Three set of model climate parameter are used to explore the robustness of the result and for traceability to earlier work . The model version have climate sensitivity of 2.8-3.3 degree C and predict atmospheric CO ( 2 ) close to present observation . Six idealized total fossil fuel CO ( 2 ) emission scenario are used to explore a range of 1,100-15,000 GtC total emission and the effect of rate of emission . Atmospheric CO ( 2 ) approach equilibrium in year 3000 at 420-5,660 ppmv , giving 1.5-12.5 degree C global warming . The ocean is a robust carbon sink of up to 6.5 GtC year ( -1 ) . Under Cybusiness a usual ' , the land becomes a carbon source around year 2100 which peak at up to 2.5 GtC year ( -1 ) . Soil carbon is lost globally , boreal vegetation generally increase , whilst under extreme forcing , dieback of some tropical and sub-tropical vegetation occurs . Average ocean surface pH drop by up to 1.15 unit . A Greenland ice sheet melt threshold of 2.6 degree C local warming is only briefly exceeded if total emission are limited to 1,100 GtC , whilst 15,000 GtC emission cause complete Greenland melt by year 3000 , contributing 7 m to sea level rise . Total sea-level rise , including thermal expansion , is 0.4-10 m in year 3000 and ongoing . The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation shuts down in two out of three model version , but only under extreme emission including exotic fossil fuel resource .

aVThe sensitivity of the characteristic of atmospheric center of action ( ACAs ) in the Northern Hemisphere to global climate change is analyzed on the basis of model of different complexity , including the climate model of intermediate complexity of the Institute of Atmospheric Physics , Russian Academy of Sciences and the ECHAM4/OPYC3 and HadCM3 general circulation model of the atmosphere and ocean . The emphasis is on the analysis of trend of the change in ACA characteristic in winter , when the long-term global warming is most considerable . The global climate model are shown to be able to describe not only the intermediate regime of ACAs but also their dynamic . In particular , ECHAM4/OPYC3 is capable of reproducing the statistically significant connection of the characteristic of the North Pacific center of action with El Nino/La Nina event , revealed from observational data . With the use of the result of the global climate model , the possible change in the characteristic of center of action in the 21st century are estimated for an increased content of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere .

aV[ 1 ] We used a simple hydrological-biogeochemical mixing model to test the hypothesis that export of total organic carbon occurring mainly during spring in taiga and tundra watershed might be compensated by production and export of bicarbonate ( HCO ( 3 ) ( - ) ) from groundwater during the rest of the year . The investigated watershed are located in northern Sweden close to the Arctic Circle . An elevated spring flow peak due to snowmelt characterizes the hydrology of boreal and arctic river system . During this snowmelt , total organic carbon ( TOC ) , previously stored a soil carbon , is flushed and exported from the watershed , and can be released to the atmosphere via heterotrophic remineralization during riverine transport to the sea , thereby contributing to atmospheric CO ( 2 ) . The TOC yield of the watershed investigated increased with vegetation and peat cover and ranged across watershed from 0.5 to 2.8 ton km ( -2 ) yr ( -1 ) . During frozen period , streamflow is dominated by `` old '' groundwater . This water ha percolated through the soil and is rich in DSi and bicarbonate ; that is , atmospheric carbon that ha been `` consumed '' in chemical weathering process is partly exported a bicarbonate to the sea , where carbon is stored a CaCO ( 3 ) for geological time . The bicarbonate export of the watershed investigated wa between 0.4 and 1.2 ton C km ( -2 ) yr ( -1 ) corresponding to 15 - 73 % of the TOC export . Very likely , global warming will affect water flow through the soil in taiga and tundra ecosystem and thus will have an effect on watershed carbon budget . This bicarbonate export may compensate for significant amount of the exported TOC , thereby reducing the positive feedback to atmospheric CO ( 2 ) .

aVVariability in seasonal soil moisture ( SM ) and temperature ( T ) can alter ecosystem/atmosphere exchange of the trace gas carbon dioxide ( CO ) , nitrous oxide ( N2O ) , and methane ( CH4 ) . This study report the impact of year-round SM status on trace gas flux in three semiarid vegetation zone , mesquite ( 30 g organic C kg ( -1 ) soil ) , open/ forb ( 6 g organic C kg ( -1 ) soil ) , and sacaton ( 18 g organic C kg ( -1 ) soil ) from July 2002-September 2003 in southeastern Arizona . Carbon dioxide and N2O emission were highly dependent on available SM and T. During the heavy rain of the 2002 monsoon ( 238 mm total rainfall ) , large difference in soil C content did not correlate with variation in CO2 production , a efflux averaged 235.6 +/- 39.5 mg CO2 m ( -2 ) h ( -1 ) over all site . In 2003 , limited monsoon rain ( 95 mm total rainfall ) reduced CO2 emission by 19 % ( mesquite ) , 40 % ( open ) , and 30 % ( sacaton ) , compared with 2002 . Nitrous oxide emission averaged 21.1 +/- 13.4 ( mesquite ) , 2.1 +/- 4.4 ( open ) , and 3.9 +/- 5.2 mu g N2O m ( -2 ) h ( -1 ) ( sacaton ) during the 2002 monsoon . Limited monsoon 2003 rainfall reduced N2O emission by 47 % in the mesquite , but N2O production increased in the open ( 55 % ) and sacaton ( 5 % ) site . Following a dry winter and spring 2002 ( 15 mm total rainfall ) , premonsoon CH , consumption at all site wa close to zero , but following monsoon moisture input , the CH4 sink averaged 26.1 +/- 6.3 tLg CH4 m ( -1 ) h ( -1 ) through April 2003 . Laboratory incubation showed potential for CH4 oxidation from 0 to 45 cm , suggesting that a the soil surface dried , CH , oxidation activity shifted downward in the sandy soil . Predicted climate change shift in annual precipitation from one dominated by summer monsoon rainfall to one with higher winter precipitation may reduce soil CO , and N2O emission while promoting CH4 oxidation rate in semiarid riparian soil of the Southwest , potentially acting a a negative feedback for future global warming .

aVAssessment of the extent of coral bleaching ha become an important part of study that aim to understand the condition of coral reef . In this study a reference card that us difference in coral colour wa developed a an inexpensive , rapid and non-invasive method for the assessment of bleaching . The card us a 6 point brightness/saturation scale within four colour hue to record change in bleaching state . Changes on the scale of 2 unit or more reflect a change in symbiont density and chlorophyll a content , and therefore the bleaching state of the coral . When used by non-specialist observer in the field ( here on an intertidal reef flat ) , there wa an inter-observer error of I colour score . This technique improves on existing subjective assessment of bleaching state by visual observation and offer the potential for rapid , wide-area assessment of changing coral condition .

aVFuture global warming may depend strongly on the potential for abating emission of greenhouse gas ( GHGs ) . Flexibility in implementing climate change mitigation policy can significantly reduce mitigation cost and ha three dimension ; space , time and gas specie . Therefore , multiple greenhouse gas reduction flexibility should be considered . The emission and reduction potential of CO2 and non-CO2 GHGs are assessed here using an integrated assessment model under climate change target . The implication on gas life a well a abatement timing uncertainty on cost , technological availability , etc . are discussed . The introduction of additional multigas reduction will cut the economic burden of achieving a given climate change target . The conclusion are threefold ; ( 1 ) Multigas mitigation is a cost effective strategy compared to CO2-only mitigation under the same climate target , ( 2 ) CO2 mitigation is expected to lead to ancillary reduction in CH4 , N2O and SOx emission , and ( 3 ) There is great uncertainty in the assessment of non-CO2 GHG mitigation opportunity .

aVIn the light of global warming and sea level rise there are many coastal beach that suffer from erosion . Beach nourishment ha become a common practice to maintain the sediment balance on a shore-face . In this paper , a three-dimensional numerical model for evaluating long-term impact of beach nourishment project ha been developed . The model address the longstanding complex issue of coastal morphology and sediment grain size distribution from an unconventional angle , which exploit the strong link between grain size distribution and the prevailing transport direction of each sediment constituent under 'average ' wave and storm action . The present model predicts the redistribution of nourished sediment according to the subtle clue implied by equilibrium distribution curve and latest coastal wave transformation theory . After verification against recent field observation in Terschelling , The Netherlands , the model wa used to predict long-term effect of different beach nourishment strategy . It wa found that : ( a ) given the source sediment available in Terschelling the tactic of large volume and le frequent implementation are better than otherwise ; and ( b ) from a pure engineering point of view , waterline nourishment outperforms offshore trough nourishment . The model offer an additional tool for coastal engineer to evaluate the feasibility , effectiveness and the optimization of dumping location for beach nourishment project . It is also a useful tool for stratigraphic modelling of shallow-marine sedimentation in conjunction with sea level change . ( c ) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVSteelmaking based on natural gas rather than coal is proposed a a logical solution to concern about climate change and global warming . Highly preheated iron ore fine are fed onto the surface of the molten iron carrier medium in a single loop melt circulation reactor . A thin layer of liquid iron ore is formed and reduction occurs a the molten iron oxide containing melt is transported along the length of the reduction arm countercurrent to natural gas in situ generated reducing gas flowing at high velocity . Issues relating to Kelvin-Helmholtz instability are addressed and detailed consideration is given to soot formation and it subsequent gasification in the bulk gas phase . Key parameter for 1 Mtpa liquid steel are evaluated based on thermal decomposition of methane by convective heat transfer and reduction of ferrous oxide controlled by gaseous diffusion . A breakdown of capital and operating cost indicates the relative importance of key element .

aVThe cinereous vulture Aegypius monachus is the largest bird of the western Palaearctic , and is threatened over it entire range of distribution . Considering explicitly the influence of human interference , we studied breeding habitat selection in seven breeding colony using a geographic information system and multivariate statistical model . Steep area far from human disturbance constituted the preferential breeding site in all the colony . The nesting substrate and climatic condition varied between colony , but always corresponded to non-extreme climate , and included tree specie of adequate size . Since human activity influenced the breeding habitat choice , there is a potential for management policy that can clearly be of benefit for the conservation of this vulture . These would fundamentally be a follows : ( 1 ) forestry activity should be oriented to protecting oak ( Quercus spp . ) and pine ( Pinus ssp . ) stand , especially individual tree of great height , and to replacing eucalyptus ( Eucalyptus spp . ) with autochthonous specie ; ( 2 ) activity ( recreational , economic , etc . ) around the breeding area should be scheduled and spatially organized to avoid disturbance , particularly those deriving from the proximity of road and track ; ( 3 ) the expected effect of global warming should be compensated , identifying future site where the habitat can be managed , supplementary food can be provided and reserve can be designed .

aVThe impact of management on global warming potential ( GWP ) , crop production , and greenhouse gas intensity ( GHGI ) in irrigated agriculture is not well documented . A no-fill ( NT ) cropping system study initiated in 1999 to evaluate soil organic carbon ( SOC ) sequestration potential in irrigated agriculture wa used in this study to make trace gas flux measurement for 3 yr to facilitate a complete greenhouse gas accounting of GWP and GHGI . Fluxes of CO2 , CH4 , and N2O were measured using static , vented chamber , one to three time per week , year round , from April 2002 through October 2004 within conventional-till continuous corn ( CT-CC ) and NT continuous corn ( NT-CC ) plot and in NT corn-soybean rotation ( NT-CB ) plot . Nitrogen fertilizer rate ranged from 0 to 224 kg N ha ( -1 ) . Methane flux were small and did not differ between tillage system . Nitrous oxide flux increased linearly with increasing N fertilizer rate each year , but emission rate varied with year . Carbon dioxide efflux wa higher in CT compared to NT in 2002 but wa not different by tillage in 2003 or 2004 . Based on soil respiration and residue C input , NT soil were net sink of GWP when adequate fertilizer wa added to maintain crop production . The CT soil were smaller net sink for GWP than NT soil . The determinant for the net GWP relationship wa a balance between soil respiration and N2O emission . Based on soil C sequestration , only NT soil were net sink for GWP . Both estimate of GWP and GHGI indicate that when appropriate crop production level are achieved , net CO2 emission are reduced . The result suggest that economic viability and environmental conservation can be achieved by minimizing tillage and utilizing appropriate level of fertilizer .

aVThe objective of this work wa to evaluate through a numerical study the impact of a possible climate change on the yield of wheat , soybean and maize , in Santa Maria , RS . Climate change scenario were created by doubling CO2 , with different increase in air temperature , and with increase and without increase in rainfall . Yield of the three crop wa simulated with model available in the literature . It wa concluded that projected climate change will affect wheat , soybean and maize yield in Santa Maria , RS , Brazil . The increase of 2 , 3 and 6 degree C may cancel the benefit of increasing CO2 on yield of wheat , soybean and maize , respectively .

aVAnnual and monthly snow accumulation for the Greenland Ice Sheet wa derived from ECMWF forecast [ mainly 40-yr ECMWR Re-Analysis ( ERA-40 ) ] and further meteorological modeling . Modeled accumulation wa validated using 58 ice core accumulation datasets across the ice sheet and wa found to be 95 % of the observed accumulation on average , with a mean correlation of 0.53 between modeled and observed . Many of the ice core datasets are new and are presented here for the first time . Central and northern interior part of the ice sheet were found to be similar to 10 % -30 % too dry in ERA-40 , in line with earlier ECMWF analysis , although too much ( > 50 % locally ) snow accumulation wa modeled for interior southern part of Greenland . Nevertheless , 47 of 58 site show significant correlation in temporal variability of modeled with observed accumulation . The model also capture the absolute amount of snow accumulation at several site , most notably Das1 and Das2 in southeast Greenland . Mean modeled accumulation over the ice sheet wa 0.279 ( standard deviation 0.034 ) m yr ( -1 ) for 1958-2003 with no significant trend for either the ice sheet or any of the core site . Unusually high accumulation in southeast Greenland in 2002/03 lead the author to study meteorological synoptic forcing pattern and comment on the prospect of enhanced climate variability leading to more such event a a result of global warming . There is good agreement between precipitation measured at coastal meteorological station in southern Greenland and accumulation modeled for adjacent region of the ice sheet . There is no significant persistent relation between the North Atlantic Oscillation index and whole or southern Greenland accumulation .

aVThe author identify and describe the following global force of nature driving the Earth 's climate : ( 1 ) solar radiation a a dominant external energy supplier to the Earth , ( 2 ) outgassing a a major supplier of gas to the World Ocean and the atmosphere , and , possibly , ( 3 ) microbial activity generating and consuming atmospheric gas at the interface of lithosphere and atmosphere . The writer provide quantitative estimate of the scope and extent of their corresponding effect on the Earth 's climate . Quantitative comparison of the scope and extent of the force of nature and anthropogenic influence on the Earth 's climate is especially important at the time of broad-scale public debate on current global warming .

aVGlobal warming is a common subject in steel industry in every country . International cooperation will be required using the Kyoto Mechanism from global aspect . In the integrated steel work , there are various mean to decrease reducing agent at blast furnace , however , preferable way to reduce CO2 emission must be chosen considering energy balance in whole steel work , and energy saving must be actively pursued . Injection of waste plastic and carbon neutral material such a biomass is better alternative . In the near future , hydrogen will attract attention a a clean energy source even in the steel work . Regarding oxygen blast furnace and smelting reduction , the possibility of CO2 reduction is dependent on optimum system design of total process including outside process . Charge of prereduced sinter and high reactivity coke to blast furnace lead to reduction of CO2 keeping current blast furnace facility and capability .

aVRapid shift in past climate recorded in polar ice sheet have elicited various explanation relating to either thermohaline circulation change by ice-rafting or natural greenhouse gas concentration modulated by climatic condition in the tropic . To compare the tropical paleoclimate record with the polar record , one must choose sediment core from highly productive ocean region . Necessarily , such region reflect the wind record in the tropic , because high productivity is associated with upwelling driven by wind . Comparing tropical precipitation record with high-latitude record is , however , a more difficult task because sediment recording paleoprecipitation usually have low sedimentation rate , and offer coarser resolution relative to polar ice core . Here , we present delta O-18 data of three planktonic specie of Foraminifera ( a proxy for precipitation ) from such a sediment core , spanning the past 35 ka for the equatorial Indian Ocean , which fall under the southwest monsoon ( SWM ) realm . Results show that minimum SWM precipitation occurred at the Last Glacial Maximum , with a subsequent increase at Termination IA . During the Holocene , SWM precipitation intensified uniformly up to the core top ( similar to 2.2 ka B.P . ) , a revealed by generally decreasing delta O-18 value . Variations in precipitation are consistent with climate change recorded in polar ice sheet . Although the different resolution of the two record preclude a rigorous comparison , abrupt cooling/warming event appear to be accompanied by sudden reduction/enhancement in ( SWM ) rainfall . Thus , mechanism with time scale much shorter than a millennium , such a natural greenhouse warming ( e.g. , CH4 concentration ) , controlled by emission from the tropic , could have played a major role in high-latitude climate change .

aVDespite general agreement that global climate change is taking place there is le consensus about the consequence and impact that may arise . The possibility of greater climatic variability , with change in the incidence of particular type of event , requires multidisciplinary research so that associated impact can be considered when devising environmental management strategy . Past hydrological event investigated using palaeoenvironmental technique , over time period longer than the period of continuous record , are a possible source of information to complement monitored record . Six international research group ( GLOCOPH Commission of INQUA , Water Sustainability Commission of IGU , LUCIFS in IGBP-PAGES , Geomorphic Challenges for the 21st Century Commission of IGU , International Commission on Continental Erosion of IAHS , and Fluvial Archives Group [ FLAG ] associated with INQUA and IGU ) have each contributed result from their specific time and spatial scale in integrated research collaboration . Relevant research conclusion have been combined and a research project under-taken which is the subject of four later paper . A provisional protocol for use of past hydrological event in order to understand global change is proposed and adapted in the final paper , to take account of other paper included and contribution to the discussion .

aVTotal P ( P-t ) on a carbonate-free basis in an entire loess-paleosol sequence and P-t , organic P ( P-o ) and inorganic P ( P-i ) in the S-0-L-1-S-1 sequence were investigated in detail with different resolution for the Luochuan loess section from northern China . P-t content varies between 393 and 786 ppm throughout the loess-paleosol sequence , and is generally higher in the loess than in interstratified paleosols , showing fluctuation cycle of 100ka in correspondence to loess-paleosol alternation . P-t variation on a carbonate-free basis in the loess-paleosol sequence could indicate variation in atmosphere precipitation resulting in different leaching loss of P from palcosols . P-i ha an average value of 499 ppm with a range of 324-560 ppm , accounting for more than 70 % of P-t in the S-0-L-1-S-1 sequence , where the minimum of P-i in the Malan loess is higher than the maximum of P-i in S-1 . P-o range between 59 and 233 ppm with an average of 132 ppm in the S-0-L-1-S-1 sequence . Phosphorus ( P ) wa initially delivered to the Luochuan loess section via influx of aeolian dust from the northern desert and Gobi area by the East Asian winter monsoon , and then wa modified by pedogenesis associated with the East Asian summer monsoon during the last 130 ka. '' Preserved P-t '' in the loess L-1 is tightly correlated with grain size without leaching loss of P due to enrichment of P in fine-grained fraction , a well a '' initial P-t '' . '' Leaching P-t '' data show that paleosol S-1 had lost 15-40 % of it '' initial P-t '' , and that there wa much more precipitation in S-1 than in L-1 . P-i subject to slightly weak pedogenesis wa completely transformed into P-o without leaching loss of P in loess L-1 . By contrast , much P-i disappeared from paleosol S , due to strong pedogenesis , partly through leaching and partly through conversion to organic form during P cycling process . P-o variation is similar to those of MS and the < 7.8 mu m fraction in L-1 , but contains more information on the East Asian winter monsoon due to weak pedogenesis without leaching of P. P-o in S-1 lower than L1SS1 , a a consequence of strong decomposition of the organic matter kept constantly in the middle of S-1 where P-i kept at the lowest of 423 ppm , suggesting that there existed a very warm and humid climate related to the enhanced summer monsoon during that period . The mean organic P/inorganic P ratio ( P-o/P-i ) is lower in the L1LL1 and L1LL2 than in the S-0 , S-1 , and L1SS1 , indicating that low P-o/P-i ratio coincide with weak weathering-pedogenesis , and higher P-o/P-i ratio correspond to strong weathering-pedogenesis . P-o/P-i ratio can eliminate the effect of grain size on aeolian dust because of chemical uniformity of aeolian dust and enrichment of P-o and P-i in the fine-grained fraction . Thus , P-o/P-i ratio is solely linked to pedogenesis of the Luochuan loess section . Variation in P-o/P-i ratiois similar to those of MS and the Marine Oxygen Isotope composition , indicating the summer monsoon evolution during the last 130 ka and providing the biogeochemical evidence for further understanding the genetic link between the East Asian monsoon and global climate change .

aVRelatively little research ha been conducted on how climate change may affect the structure and function of arid to semiarid ecosystem of the American Southwest . Along the slope of the San Francisco Peaks of Arizona , USA , I transferred intact soil core from a spruce-fir to a ponderosa pine forest 730 m lower in elevation to ass the potential impact of climate change on soil N cycling and trace gas flux . The low-elevation site ha a mean annual soil temperature about 2.5 degree C higher than the high-elevation site . Net rate of N transformation and trace gas flux were measured in high-elevation soil core incubated in situ and soil core transferred to the low-elevation site . Over a 13-month period , volumetric soil water content wa similar in transferred soil core relative to soil core incubated in situ . Net N mineralization and nitrification increased over 80 % in transferred soil core compared with in situ soil core . Soil transfer significantly increased net CO2 efflux ( 120 % ) and net CH4 consumption ( 90 % ) relative to flux of these gas from soil core incubated in situ . Soil net N2O flux were relatively low and were not generally altered by soil transfer . Although the soil microbial biomass a a whole decreased in transferred soil core compared with in situ soil core after the incubation period , active bacterial biomass increased . Transferring soil core from the low-elevation to the high-elevation site ( i.e . simulated global cooling ) commonly , but not consistently , resulted in the opposite effect on soil pool and process . In general , soil containment ( root trenching ) did not significantly affect soil measurement . My result suggest that small increase in mean annual temperature can have large impact on soil N cycling , soil-atmosphere trace gas exchange , and soil microbial community even in ecosystem where water availability is a major limiting resource .

aVManagement of agricultural soil , most notably tillage , influence wind , and water erosion , which in turn ha implication for non-point source pollution of pesticide , fertilizer , and sediment in agro-ecosystems . No-till ( NT ) practice improve soil , water , and aquatic ecosystem quality by reducing soil erosion and chemical runoff . The ability of cropland soil to sequester C from the atmosphere might help mitigate global warming . Classification of Landsat ETM+ satellite image ha the potential to identify tillage practice and soil disturbance over large area , enabling efficient monitoring of these agricultural practice . Previous study predicting tillage management had relatively small study area ( located in a single county ) , relatively low number of field ( 6-51 ) , and were temporally focused on non-planted field to reduce the potential effect of crop canopy interference and/or field patterning . Our objective were to predict in the presence of crop canopy and over a spatially large , management diverse study area ( 1 ) tillage system ( NT versus tilled ) and ( 2 ) soil disturbance . A farm survey of the study area , north central Montana , wa used to a a mean to obtain extensive field-level farm management data . We compared logistic regression ( LR ) , traditional classification tree analysis ( CTA ) , and boosted classification tree analysis ( BCTA ) for identifying NT field . Logistic regression had an overall accuracy of 94 % , BCTA 89 % , and CTA 87 % , but tillage wa not well distinguished . Soil disturbance wa estimated using linear regression ( LM ) , regression tree analysis ( RTA ) , and stochastic gradient boosting ( SGB ) , an RTA variant . Classification of soil disturbance wa best achieved using RTA ( predicted mean soil disturbance not significantly different than known soil disturbance , p-value = 0.08 ) . Classification of Landsat ETM+ imagery showed promise for predicting tillage and agricultural soil disturbance over large , heterogeneous area . ( c ) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All right reserved .

aV[ 1 ] The global climate model for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report ( IPCC AR4 ) predict very different change of rainfall over the Amazon under the SRES A1B scenario for global climate change . Five of the eleven model predict an increase of annual rainfall , three model predict a decrease of rainfall , and the other three model predict no significant change in the Amazon rainfall . We have further examined two model . The UKMO-HadCM3 model predicts an El Nino-like sea surface temperature ( SST ) change and warming in the northern tropical Atlantic which appear to enhance atmospheric subsidence and consequently reduce cloud over the Amazon . The resultant increase of surface solar absorption cause a stronger surface sensible heat flux and thus reduces relative humidity of the surface air . These change decrease the rate and length of wet season rainfall and surface latent heat flux . This decreased wet season rainfall lead to drier soil during the subsequent dry season , which in turn can delay the transition from the dry to wet season . GISS-ER predicts a weaker SST warming in the western Pacific and the southern tropical Atlantic which increase moisture transport and hence rainfall in the Amazon . In the southern Amazon and Nordeste where the strongest rainfall increase occurs , the resultant higher soil moisture support a higher surface latent heat flux during the dry and transition season and lead to an earlier wet season onset .

aVWe tested the prediction that global warming ha caused recent decrease in body weight ( Bergmann 's rule ) and increase in wing length ( Allen 's rule ) in 14 specie of passerine bird at two locality in England : Wicken Fen ( 1968-2003 ) and Treswell Wood ( 1973-2003 ) . Predicted long-term linear decrease in residual body weight occurred in four specie : dunnock ( Wicken Fen ) , and great tit , blue tit and bullfinch ( Treswell Wood ) . Non-linear decrease also occurred in reed warbler and blackcap at Wicken Fen , which also had a surprising linear increase in residual body weight in blackbird . Residual wing length increased linearly , a predicted , in six of seven specie at Wicken Fen . Whereas there were non-linear long-term increase in wren , dunnock and blackbird in Treswell Wood . Unexpected linear decrease also occurred in residual wing length in willow warbler ( Wicken Fen ) , and blue tit , great tit and chaffinch ( Treswell Wood ) . The most parsimonious explanation for such long-term change in body weight is global warming , a predicted by Bergmann 's rule . Greater site and species-specific effect on wing length ( e.g . non-linear change plus shorter wing in the woodland habitat ) suggest a le straightforward conclusion concerning Allen 's rule , probably because wing length involved variation in both bone and feather growth . Changes in residual body weight and wing length often differed between specie and were sometimes non-linear , perhaps reflecting short-term modification in selection pressure . Human-induced influence are discussed , such a avian predator population density and land-use change . Short-term variation in temperature had little effect , but rainfall did explain the unusual increase in blackbird body weight , possibly a a result of improving food ( earthworm ) availability .

aVWetlands are considered to be the biggest unknown regarding the influence of global climate change on element dynamic , so knowledge of process and condition controlling sink and source function of redox process is crucial . The aim of this study wa to investigate the sink/source function of nitrate , Fe , sulfate reduction and methanogenesis of an upland and a lowland fen within a boreal spruce catchment , southern Germany . We used suction cup and anaerobic dialysis chamber for soil solution sampling , FeS probe for the determination of S oxidation potential and stability of anoxic condition and analysis of the soil solid phase ( content of C , S and Fe specie ) . Both fen had high rate of nitrate reduction and potentially high rate of CH4 production . The upper few cm of all profile were oxic with low CH4 concentration , suggesting low CH4 emission rate from the soil , though emission by vascular plant can not be excluded . Sulfate and Fe reduction process differed significantly in the fen . The upland fen wa characterized by relatively stable anoxic condition , low Fe content but high content of organic S and low C/S ratio . We concluded that the upland fen is an effective sink for sulfate with long-term S storage . In contrast , the lowland fen wa characterized by alternating oxidation-reduction cycle with high Fe content , lower content of organic S and higher C/S ratio . Thus , even though low sulfate and high Fe concentration in soil solution indicated high reduction rate in the lowland fen , long-term storage of S is not likely in this fen . Differences in biogeochemical process between site are most likely not associated with hydrology but rather with the role of vascular plant . ( c ) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVThe aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of meteorological factor on Ambrosia pollen concentration and it impact on medical consultation for allergic rhinitis of resident from various socio-economic level in Montreal ( Quebec , Canada ) between 1994 and 2002 . The study wa conducted to recognize the sensitivity of pollen productivity to daily climate variability in order to estimate the consequence on human health vulnerability in the context of global climate change . Information related to medical consultation for allergic rhinitis due to pollen come from the Quebec Health Insurance Board ( Regie de l'assurance-maladie du Quebec ) . Ambrosia pollen concentration wa measured by the Aerobiology Research Laboratories ( Nepean , Ontario ) . Daily temperature ( maximum , minimum , and mean ) and precipitation data were obtained from the Meteorological Service of Canada . Socio-economic data come from the 1996 and 2001 census data of Statistics Canada . Between 1994 and 2002 , during the Ambrosia pollen season , 7667 consultation for allergic rhinitis due to pollen were recorded . We found a significant association between the number of medical consultation and pollen level . Significant association were detected for over-consultation the day of exposure , 1 , 2 , 3 and 5 day after exposure to high level of pollen . The consultation rate is higher from low-income resident ( 3.10 consultation per 10,000 inhabitant ) than for high-income ( 1.65 consultation per 10,000 inhabitant ) . Considering the demonstrated impact of pollen level on health , it ha become critical to ensure adequate monitoring of Ambrosia and it meteorological sensivity in the context of the anticipated climate change and it potential consequence on human health .

aVGlobal warming ha obtained more and more attention because the global mean surface temperature ha increased since the late 19th century . As more than 50 % of the human population life in city , urbanization ha become an important contributor for global warming . Pearl River Delta ( PRD ) in Guangdong Province , southern China , is one of the region experiencing rapid urbanization that ha resulted in remarkable Urban Heat Island ( UHI ) effect , which will be sure to influence the regional climate , environment , and socio-economic development . In this study , Landsat TM and ETM+ image from 1990 to 2000 in the PRD were selected to retrieve the brightness temperature and land use/cover type . A new index , Normalized Difference Bareness Index ( NDBaI ) , wa proposed to extract bare land from the satellite image . Additionally , Shenzhen , which ha experienced the fastest urbanization in Guangdong Province , wa taken a an example to analyze the temperature distribution and change within a large city a it size expanded in the past decade . Results show that the UHI effect ha become more prominent in area of rapid urbanization in the PRD region . The spatial distribution of heat island ha been changed from a mixed pattern , where bare land , semi-bare land and land under development were warmer than other surface type , to extensive UHI . Our analysis showed that higher temperature in the UHI wa located with a scattered pattern , which wa related to certain land-cover type . In order to analyze the relationship between UHI and land-cover change , this study attempted to employ a quantitative approach in exploring the relationship between temperature and several index , including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ( NDVI ) , Normalized Difference Water Index ( NDWI ) , Normalized Difference Bareness Index ( NDBaI ) and Normalized Difference Build-up Index ( NDBI ) . It wa found that correlation between NDVI , NDWI , NDBaI and temperature are negative when NDVI is limited in range , but positive correlation is shown between NDBI and temperature .

aVComparative analysis of interspecific difference in response to climate change can provide important insight into the factor initiating seasonal onset of reproduction in various specie and subsequent fitness consequence . We present a comparative analysis based on a 30-year breeding survey of two related migratory songbird specie [ Reed Warbler Acrocephalus scirpaceus ( RW ) and Great Reed Warbler A. arundinaceus ( GRW ) ] , which coexist in reedbeds by mean of various interspecific interaction . The RW advanced breeding by 15 day and shortened it breeding time window , which is a combined effect of higher temperature , alleviated competition a a consequence of population decline in the dominant GRW , and reduced RW population . Although the breeding period of GRW changed only slightly , it clutch initiation wa likewise related to temperature . Most probably , advanced breeding in RW is favoured by change in food supply and accelerated reed growth , which provides the necessary nest concealment earlier , whereas this doe not affect the GRW , a specie le vulnerable to nest predation . Clutch size decreased later in the season , so that earlier breeding produced a net increase in both specie . An additional increase of clutch size in GRW can be explained by the use of higher-quality territory in today 's smaller population . The main cause of nest loss were predation in RW and adverse weather in GRW , but reproductive success increased over the study period in both specie , which wa a consequence of larger clutch in RW , but of favourable weather during rearing and fewer total loss in GRW . Our result document that different causal mechanism are involved in the reproductive change of the two congeneric specie living in the same habitat : RW breeding earlier by making use of competitive release and other ecological improvement , and GRW by benefiting from better rearing condition . As specie respond differentially to climate change depending on ecosystem and biotic interaction , prediction of population dynamic will remain vague until the specific response mechanism have been elucidated .

aVAtlantic hurricane and their sensitivity to anthropogenic warming are investigated using very high ( 0.5 degree x0.5 degree over the Atlantic domain ) resolution global simulation . The ARPEGE-Climat variable resolution grid demonstrates it usefulness in regional climate study since resolution can be multiplied by a factor of 2.5 over the domain of interest compared to a uniform grid , for a similar computer cost . The question of hurricane characteristic dependence on anthropogenic warming is tackled trough the implementation of a tracking method . Changes in the total number , a well a location , of hurricane appear to depend more on sea surface temperature ( SST ) spatial pattern anomaly than Atlantic mean intensity , essentially through the change in large scale vertical wind shear . A uniform SST anomaly forcing produce increased and eastward shifted system while a spatially contrasted anomaly lead to a decrease . Comparison between cyclogenesis density calculated from tracking or large scale combined variable ( a a modified Gray parameter ) brings some confidence in the use of the latter to investigate low resolution simulation . Mean hurricane dynamical characteristic are weakly changed by the warming but precipitation core and latent heat flux are enhanced in all scenario .

aVUsing the climate change experiment generated for the Fourth Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , this study examines some aspect of the change in the hydrological cycle that are robust across the model . These response include the decrease in convective mass flux , the increase in horizontal moisture transport , the associated enhancement of the pattern of evaporation minus precipitation and it temporal variance , and the decrease in the horizontal sensible heat transport in the extratropics . A surprising finding is that a robust decrease in extratropical sensible heat transport is found only in the equilibrium climate response , a estimated in slab ocean response to the doubling of CO ( 2 ) , and not in transient climate change scenario . All of these robust response are consequence of the increase in lower-tropospheric water vapor .

aVWe theoretically study the statistic of record-breaking daily temperature and validate these prediction using both Monte Carlo simulation and 126 year of available data from the city of Philadelphia . Using extreme statistic , we derive the number and the magnitude of record temperature event , based on the observed Gaussian daily temperature distribution in Philadelphia , a a function of the number of year of observation . We then consider the case of global warming , where the mean temperature systematically increase with time . Over the 126-year time range of observation , we argue that the current warming rate is insufficient to measurably influence the frequency of record temperature event , a conclusion that is supported by numerical simulation and by the Philadelphia data . We also study the role of correlation between temperature on successive day and find that they do not affect the frequency or magnitude of record temperature event .

aVHydrofluorocarbons are now well established a refrigerant because of their zero ozone depletion potential . Since they have a high global warming potential , other alternative a , e.g . fluorinated ether or cyclic hydrocarbon are considered a next-generation refrigerant . Screening of alternative refrigerant is difficult because mostly no or only few data are available . To evaluate , e.g . the cycle performance , the thermodynamic property of the refrigerant must be known and described accurately by an equation of state . Here , the physically based BACKONE equation are used to describe alternative refrigerant , such a natural refrigerant , hydrofluorocarbon , fluorinated cyclic hydrocarbon , and fluorinated ether . BACKONE need only a few substance specific parameter to describe thermodynamic property with high accuracy . Thus , even alternative refrigerant , with very few available experimental data can be described . Calculations with BACKONE of the performance of many refrigerant show that some hydrocarbon and fluorinated ether are a good alternative . ( c ) 2005 Elsevier Ltd and IIR . All right reserved .

aVThe dynamical basis for seasonal to decadal climate prediction and predictability over South America is reviewed . It is shown that , while global tropical SSTs affect both predictability and prediction over South America , the current lack of SST predictability over the tropical Atlantic represents a limiting factor to seasonal climate prediction over some part of the continent . The model 's skill varies with the continental region : the highest skill is found in the `` Nordeste '' region and the lowest skill over southeastern Brazil . It is also suggested that current two-tier approach to predict seasonal climate variation might represent a major limitation to forecast coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomenon like the South Atlantic convergence zone . Also discussed are the possible effect of global climate change on regional predictability of seasonal climate .

aVHuman impact on the few ancient lake of the world must be assessed , a any change can lead to an irreversible loss of endemic community . In such an assessment , the sensitivity of Lake Ohrid ( Macedonia/Albania ; surface area A = 358 km ( 2 ) , volume V = 55 km ( 3 ) , > 200 endemic specie ) to three major human impacts-water abstraction , eutrophication , and global warming-is evaluated . It is shown that ongoing eutrophication present the major threat to this unique lake system , even under the conservative assumption of an increase in phosphorus ( P ) concentration from the current 4.5 to a potential future 9 mg P m ( -3 ) . Eutrophication would lead to a significant reduction in light penetration , which is a prerequisite for endemic , deep living plankton community . Moreover , a P increase to 9 mg P m ( -3 ) would create deep water anoxia through elevated oxygen consumption and increase in the water column stability due to more mineralization of organic material . Such anoxic condition would severely threaten the endemic bottom fauna . The trend toward anoxia is further amplified by the predicted global warming of 0.04 degree C yr ( -1 ) , which significantly reduces the frequency of complete seasonal deep convective mixing compared to the current warming of 0.006 degree C yr ( -1 ) . This reduction in deep water exchange is triggered by the warming process rather than by overall higher temperature in the lake . In contrast , deep convective mixing would be even more frequent than today under a higher temperature equilibrium , a a result of the temperature dependence of the thermal expansivity of water . Although water abstraction may change local habitat , e.g. , karst spring area , it effect on overall lake property wa shown to be of minor importance .

aVAbrupt global warming and profound perturbation of the carbon cycle during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum ( PETM , ca . 55 Ma ) have been linked to a massive release of carbon into the ocean-atmosphere system . Increased phytoplankton productivity ha been invoked to cause subsequent CO ( 2 ) drawdown , cooling , and environmental recovery . However , interpretation of geochemical and biotic data differ on when and where this increased productivity occurred . Here we present high-resolution nannofossil assemblage data from a shelf section ( the U.S. Geological Survey [ USGS ] drill hole at Wilson Lake , New Jersey ) and an open-ocean location ( Ocean Drilling Program [ ODP ] Site 1209 , paleoequatorial Pacific ) . These data combined with published biotic record indicate a transient steepening of shelf-offshelf trophic gradient across the PETM onset and peak , with a decrease in open-ocean productivity coeval with increased nutrient availability in shelf area . Productivity level recovered in the open ocean during the later stage of the event , which , coupled with intensified continental weathering rate , may have played an important role in carbon sequestration and CO ( 2 ) drawdown .

aVOne proposal for ameliorating global warming is to sequester large amount of carbon dioxide in the deep ocean , but the environmental consequence of sequestration for sediment-dwelling animal are poorly known . In a previous publication , we reported that similar to 80 % of benthic copepod were killed in an experimental release of CO ( 2 ) off northern California at 3262 m. The effect of this release on nematode are reported here . We examined sample of nematode taken inside two 'corrals ' into which CO ( 2 ) wa directly injected ( providing an extreme endpoint for CO ( 2 ) exposure ) and taken near to and far from this CO ( 2 ) source . After 30 day , pore-water pH wa unchanged ( similar to 7.8 ) at the sediment-water interface far ( similar to 40 m ) from corral , but pH profile were reduced by similar to 0.75 near ( similar to 2m ) corral . Corral pH wa highly acidic ( 5.4 in a measurement from a subsequent experiment ) . Fifty randomly selected nematode from each of four vertical layer from the 14 core were photographed . They were assigned to a tail group ( based on morphology ) , and individual biovolume wa estimated from measurement of body length and width . Although nematode abundance ( expressed a total nematode and by tail group ) wa not affected , length , width , and individual biovolume significantly differed between near and far sample . Median nematode biovolume examined across tail group and core layer increased by similar to 48 % inside and near corral . Differences between near and corral sample were always le than difference between near and far sample . However , nematode length : width ratio did not differ between near and far , and the shape of length , width , and biovolume frequency distribution were similar in all sample . We postulate that the nematode community throughout the upper 3 cm suffered a high rate of mortality after exposure to CO ( 2 ) , and that nematode were larger because postmortem expansion in body length and width occurred . Decomposition rate were probably low and corps did not disintegrate in 30 day . The observable effect of a reduction in pH to about 7.0 after 30 day were a great a an extreme pH reduction ( 5.4 ) , suggesting that 'moderate ' CO ( 2 ) exposure , compared to the range of exposure possible following CO ( 2 ) release , cause high mortality rate in the two most abundant sediment-dwelling metazoan ( nematode and copepod ) .

aVSoil carbon sequestration ( SCS ) ha emerged a a technology with significant potential to help stabilize atmospheric CO ( 2 ) concentration and thus reduce the threat of global warming . Methods and model are needed to evaluate and recommend SCS practice based on their effect on carbon dynamic and environmental quality . Environment Policy Integrated Climate ( EPIC ) is a widely used and tested model for simulating many agroecosystem process including plant growth , crop yield , tillage , wind and water erosion , runoff , soil density , and leaching . Here we describe new C and N module developed in EPIC built on concept from the Century model to connect the simulation of soil C dynamic to crop management , tillage method , and erosion process . The added C and N routine interact directly with soil moisture , temperature , erosion , tillage , soil density , leaching , and translocation function in EPIC . Equations were also added to describe the effect of soil texture on soil C stabilization . Lignin concentration is modeled a a sigmoidal function of plant age . EPIC wa tested against data from a conservation reserve program ( CRP ) 6-year experiment at five site in three U.S. Great Plains state and a 61-year long-term agronomic experiment near Breton , Canada . Mean square deviation ( MSD ) calculated for CRP site were le than 0.01 ( kg C m ( -2 ) ) ( 2 ) , except for one site where it reached 0.025 ( kg C m ( -2 ) ) ( 2 ) . MSD value in the 61-year experiment ranged between 0.047 and 0.077 ( kg C m ( -2 ) ) ( 2 ) . The version of the EPIC model presented and tested here contains the necessary algorithm to simulate SCS and improve understanding of the interaction among soil erosion , C dynamic , and tillage . A strength of the model a tested is it ability to explain the variability in crop production , C input and SOC and N cycling over a wide range of soil , cropping and climatic condition over period from 6 to 61 year . For example , at the Breton site over 61 year , EPIC accounted for 69 % of the variability in grain yield , 89 % of the variability in C input and 91 % of the variability in SOC content in the top 15 cm . Continued development is needed in understanding why it overpredicts at low SOC and underpredicts at high SOC . Possibilities now exist to connect the C and N cycling part of EPIC to algorithm to describe denitrification a driven by C metabolism and oxygen availability . ( c ) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

aVThe multi-component `` green '' McGill Paleoclimate Model ( MPM ) , which includes interactive vegetation , is used to simulate the next glacial inception under orbital and prescribed atmospheric CO ( 2 ) forcing . This intermediate complexity model is first run for short-term period with an increasing atmospheric CO ( 2 ) concentration ; the model 's response is in general agreement with the result of GCMs for CO ( 2 ) doubling . The green MPM is then used to derive projection of the climate for the next 100 kyr . Under a constant CO ( 2 ) level , the model produce three type of evolution for the ice volume : an imminent glacial inception ( low CO ( 2 ) level ) , a glacial inception in 50 kyr ( CO ( 2 ) level of 280 or 290 ppm ) , or no glacial inception during the next 100 kyr ( CO ( 2 ) level of 300 ppm and higher ) . This high sensitivity to the CO ( 2 ) level is due to the exceptionally weak future variation of the summer insolation at high northern latitude . The change in vegetation re-inforce the buildup of ice sheet after glacial inception . Finally , if an initial global warming episode of finite duration is included , after which the atmospheric CO ( 2 ) level is assumed to stabilize at 280 , 290 or 300 ppm , the impact of this warming is seen only in the first 5 kyr of the run ; after this time the response is insensitive to the early warming perturbation .

aVEstimation of nitrous oxide ( N2O ) emission from arable soil , in relation to crop fertilization , is essential to devise strategy to mitigate the impact of agriculture on global warming . This paper present the development and test of a N2O model resulting from the linkage of a dynamic soil-crop simulation model ( CERES ) with two sub-models of N2O production and reduction in soil . These sub-models ( NOE and NGAS ) account for both the nitrification and denitrification pathway . The resulting model ( CERES NOE and CERES-NGAS ) were tested against experimental data collected on three contrasting wheat-cropped soil representative of the Beauce agricultural region in France . Although the input variable for the N2O module were correctly simulated , CERES-NGAS wa over-responsive to soil water content in a Haplic Calcisol , and strongly over-estimated the N2O flux a a result . On the other hand , CERES-NOE predicted correct mean N2O emission level for all site , but failed to simulate the peak flux observed in the week following fertilizer application in the most N2O-productive soil . Both model achieved root mean squared error in the 23-26 g N-N2O ha ( -1 ) day ( -1 ) range , significantly higher than the average experimental error on the measurement . On the other hand , their mean deviation were acceptable , being lower than 2.2 g N-N2O ha ( -1 ) day ( -1 ) , compared with a mean observed flux of 7.9 g N-N2O ha ( -1 ) day ( -1 ) . Overall , the response of CERES-NOE to soil type wa more accurate , but this came at the cost of costly , site-specific characterization on the soil ' biological property . The development of pedo-transfer function to infer these parameter from basic soil characteristic appears a a pre-requisite for the use of CERES-NOE on a wider scale .

aVdSequestration and storage of carbon ( C ) by agricultural soil ha been cited a one potential part of the solution to soil degradation and global climate change . However , C sequestration in soil is a slow and dynamic process . The objective of this study wa to evaluate the effect of crop rotation and N fertilizer management on soil organic C ( SOC ) level at several point in time during 18 yr of a long-term study in the Western Corn Belt . Seven cropping system ( three monoculture , two 2-yr , and two 4-yr rotation ) with three level of N fertilizer were compared . Soil sample were taken in the spring in 1984 , 1992 , 1998 , and 2002 to a depth of 30 cm in 0- to 7.5- , 7.5- to 15- , and 15- to 30-cm increment . No difference were obtained in SOC level in 1984 at the beginning of the study . After 8 yr , rotation significantly increased SOC 449 kg ha ( -1 ) across all cropping system . From 1992 to 2002 , SOC level in the 0- to 7.5-cm depth decreased by 516 kg ha ( -1 ) across all cropping system . Soil organic C level in the 7.5- to 15-cm depth in 1992 and 2002 demonstrated similar rotation effect to those in the surface 0- to 7.5-cm , being not significantly affected from 1984 to 1992 but being significantly decreased from 1992 to 2002 ( 568 kg SOC ha ( -1 ) across all cropping system ) . Many of the SOC gain in the surface 30 cm measured during the first 8 yr of the study were lost during the next 10 yr in all but the 4-yr cropping system after 18 yr . The loss of SOC in this latter period occurred when depth of tillage wa increased by using a tandem disk with larger-diameter disk . These result demonstrate that more than one point-in-time measurement from long-term experiment is necessary to monitor SOC change when several management variable , such a cropping system and N fertilizer , are being used . They also indicate that apparent small change in cultural practice , such a in depth of tillage in this experiment , can significantly change SOC dynamic in the soil . Subtle change in cultural practice ( e.g. , tillage depth ) can have significant long-term result , but longterm experiment are required to quantify their impact under variable climatic condition .

aVAmorphous fluorinated carbon ( a-C : F ) film with low-dielectric constant were , prepared using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition ( PECVD ) from C4F8 ( octafluorocyclobutane ) gas , C4F6 ( hexafluoro-1,3-butadiene ) gas , and C5F8 ( octafluorocyclopentene ) gas . C4F8 is now mainly used in ultra large scale integrated ( ULSI ) process , and C4F6 are expected to be substitutional gas in these process due to their low global warming potential ( GWP ) . Here , the effect of C-CF bond ratio in a-C : F film on the dielectric constant and thermal stability of the film wa studied . In all the film , both the orientational polarization and total dielectric constant decreased with decreasing C-CF bond ratio . High C-CF bond ratio of the film , however , resulted in higher residual film thickness after vacuum annealing . Based on these result , film with low dielectric constant that also have thermal and mechanical stability are difficult to achieve . Stable film property , such a leakage current , at high temperature is not le related to the C-CF bond ratio than to the parent gas .

aVThe Pacific oyster , Crassostrea gigas , well known throughout the world because of it ability to adapt to a wide range of environmental condition , wa introduced for cultivation into France on a massive scale in the 1970s . With global warming , the reproductive population , confined at the beginning to the south of the French Atlantic coast , became established at more northern latitude ( above 45 degree 58'N ) , and wild C gigas began to colonize coastal area such a our study site , Bourgneuf Bay ( 1 degrees-2 degree W , 46 degrees-47 degree N ) , an oyster-farming site . An original approach , based on orthophotograph analysis and in situ biomass sampling , revealed that , in the northern part of this bay , more than 70 % of the total C gigas biomass wa composed of wild oyster ( i.e . C gigas not bred by oystermen ) . The analysis of the spatial distribution of wild oyster indicated that 75 % of the stock consisted of wild oyster in natural bed ( rocky area ) and on low retaining wall of former fishery . Wild C gigas also colonized oyster-fanning structure with lower biomass ( 21 % of the stock composed of wild oyster ) , but locally they could reach density of up to 55 kg.m ( -1 ) i.e . 2.5 time the mean biomass of cultivated oyster . The economic and ecological consequence of this colonization by C gigas of an oyster culture site are discussed . Wild oyster seems to be the principal trophic competitor of cultivated oyster in Bourgneuf Bay . This may partly explain the decrease in growth of cultivated oyster observed in this bay during the last decade . Moreover , the trophic and spatial competition exerted by wild oyster may also affect the native biota and , in particular , the honeycomb worm Sabellaria alveolata . The result obtained in this study have led oyster farmer and regional authority to modify oyster-farming practice and to destroy wild oyster stock in concession area . ( c ) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

aVThe feared global climate change could have important effect on various environmental variable including rainfall in many country around the world . Changes in precipitation regime directly affect water resource management , agriculture , hydrology and ecosystem . For this reason it is important to investigate the change in the spatial and temporal rainfall pattern in order to improve water management strategy . In this study a non-parametric statistical method ( Mann-Kendall rank correlation method ) is employed in order to verify the existence of trend in annual , seasonal and monthly rainfall and the distribution of the rainfall during the year . This test is applied to about 250 rain gauge station in Sicily ( Italy ) after a series of procedure finalized to the estimation of missing record and to the verification of data consistency . In order to understand the regional pattern of precipitation in Sicily , the detected trend are spatially interpolated using spatial analysis technique in a GIS environment . The result show the existence of a generalized negative trend for the entire region . ( c ) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aV1 . Vascular plant growth form in northern peatlands differ in their strategy to cope with the harsh climate , low nutrient availability and progressively increasing height of the Sphagnum carpet in which they grow . Climate change may therefore affect growth form differentially , both directly and through change in the length growth of Sphagnum moss . However , the role of moss a modifier of climate-change effect on vascular plant ha been largely overlooked so far . We investigated the direct and Sphagnum-mediated effect of experimental change in summer , winter and spring climate on four specie of contrasting growth form ( evergreen and deciduous shrub , graminoid , forb ) in a subarctic bog , by studying their biomass and nitrogen loss through leaf litter , and the length growth of the two shrub . 2 . Direct and indirect effect of summer warming differed among the growth form . Enhanced Sphagnum overgrowth of leaf due to summer warming initially stimulated leaf litter loss of the evergreen shrub Empetrum nigrum . However , change in it shoot morphology , related to an apparent small increase in it length growth , prevented further effect . A stronger increase in stem growth of the deciduous shrub Betula nana in response to summer warming directly reduced it leaf litter mass , N concentration and N loss . The changed allocation prevented indirect , Sphagnum-mediated effect on it leaf and N dynamic through overgrowth of bud . In contrast , leaf litter mass , N concentration or N loss of the forb Rubus chamaemorus and the graminoid Calamagrostis lapponica were not affected by summer warming or enhanced Sphagnum growth . 3 . Increases in winter snow cover , with or without spring warming , did not affect shrub growth , nor the total shoot leaf litter mass or N dynamic of any of the growth form . 4 . Altogether , summer warming is likely to enhance Sphagnum overgrowth of small shrub with a limited growth response such a Empetrum . Moreover , increased vertical growth may allow Sphagnum to keep pace with inclined growing , responsive shrub such a Betula . This might prevent net longer-term positive effect of summer warming on the vascular plant canopy height . However , leaf litter and N loss are more likely to be affected by direct warming effect on shoot morphology and allocation than by Sphagnum growth . The different response of the growth form to summer warming suggest that both direct and Sphagnum-mediated climate effect have the potential to change the vascular plant community and N dynamic in peatlands .

aVEuropean corn borer ( ECB ) flight and ecotype spread examination were made in Hungary with the help of catching result of 44 agricultural Jermy light trap ( 2004 ) . We wondered about alteration of flight type spread borderline a a function of global climate change . Catching data were evaluated by simple mathematical proportional number . Catching result originating from different point of the country were compared with Walter-Lieth climate diagram ( 2004 ) and Peczely 's Hungarian climate district . Latter wa to reveal correlation of flight type and different climatic district . The previously published flight alteration tendency of ECB ( Keszthelyi 2003 , 2004b ) continued in 2004 . Generation quotient proved this process too . Average generation quotient of population in South-eastem Hungary wa 6 , and the top of the same rate in this district wa 10,84 . The earlier observed , ,one peak flight '' type wa replaced by , two peak flight '' type in North-western Hungary ( average generation quotient of this district : 2,5 ) . The IRIN ( relative individual number per one day ) show regressive tendency from South-eastem Hungary to North-westem Hungary ( 1RIN of 1.district : 6,99 ; 1RIN of 4.district : 4,69 ; 1RIN of 10.district : 2,78 ) , but unequivocal conclusion can not be drawn from these value for place of ecotypes . There is no unambiguous connection between Peczely 's Hungarian climate district and spread of ECB flight type a proved by the statistical examination .

aVDuring fossilization , bone is thought to recrystallize and alter chemically on timescales of kyr to a few ten of kyr , i.e. , similar to the timescale for formation of soil . Therefore , C- and O-isotope composition of bone apatite should correlate with trend in soil water composition and aridity , and serve a paleoclimate indicator . This hypothesis wa tested by analyzing C- and O-isotope composition of the CO3 component of fossil bone apatite from mid-Oligocene through late Pleistocene unit in Oregon and western Idaho , including the John Day ( 19.4-30.0 Ma ) , Mascall ( 15.2-15.8 Ma ) , and Rattlesnake ( 7.2-7.8 Ma ) Formations , whose paleosol sequence have been studied in detail , and the Juntura ( 10-11 Ma ) , Hagerman ( 3.2 Ma ) , and Fossil Lake ( 100 kyr . C-isotopes show negative and strong positive deviation during wet and dry climate respectively , and short-term trend correspond well with change in aridity within the Mascall and Rattlesnake Formations , a inferred from paleosols . A proposed correction to 6180 value based on delta ( 13 ) C anomaly implies a small , similar to 1.5 part per thousand increase in meteoric water delta ( 18 ) O during the late Oligocene global warming event , consistent with a minimum temperature increase of similar to 4 degree C. A strong inferred decrease in delta ( 18 ) O of 4-5 part per thousand after 7 Ma closely parallel compositional change in tooth enamel , and reflects a doubling in the height of the Cascade Range .

aVAn historical objective analysis of subsurface temperature and salinity wa carried out on a monthly basis from 1945 to 2003 using the latest observational database and a sea surface temperature analysis . In addition , steric sea level change were mainly examined using output of the objective analysis . The objective analysis is a revised version of Ishii et al . and is available at 16 level in the upper 700 m depth . Artificial error in the previous analysis during the 1990s have been worked out in the present analysis . The steric sea level computed from the temperature analysis ha been verified with tide gauge observation and TOPEX/Poseidon sea surface height data . A correction for crustal movement is applied for tide gauge data along the Japanese coast . The new analysis is suitable for the discussion of global warming . Validation against the tide gauge reveals that the amplitude of thermosteric sea level becomes larger and the agreement improves in comparison with the previous analysis . A substantial part of local sea level rise along the Japanese coast appears to be explained by the thermosteric effect . The thermal expansion averaged in all longitude from 60 degree S to 60 degree N explains at most half of recent sea level rise detected by satellite observation during the last decade . Considerable uncertainty remain in steric sea level , particularly over the southern ocean . Temperature change within MLD make no effective contribution to steric sea level change along the Antarctic Circumpolar Current . According to statistic using only reliable profile of the temperature and salinity analysis , salinity variation are intrinsically important to steric sea level change in high latitude and in the Atlantic Ocean . Although data sparseness is severe even in the latest decade , linear trend of global mean thermosteric and halosteric sea level for 1955 to 2003 are estimated to be 0.31 +/- 0.07 mm/yr and 0.04 +/- 0.01 mm/yr , respectively . These estimate are comparable to those of the former study .

aVThe penetration of cleaner and energy efficient technology in small power system such a the one in Sri Lanka ha encountered many problem . This ha caused major concern among the policy maker , mainly in the context of the growing need to reduce harmful emission in the electricity supply industry from the point of view of both local environmental pollution a well a the global warming concern . This paper present the outcome of a study involved in identifying and ranking the barrier to the promotion of cleaner and energy efficient technology and strategy to overcome these barrier in Sri Lanka . Barriers for renewable energy based system such a wind and wood fuel fired plant ( dendro thermal power ) and cleaner technology such a liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) fired combined cycle and IGCC ( coal ) were identified based on a survey . A direct assessment multi-criteria decision making method called Analytic Hierarchy Process ( AHP ) wa used to rank the barrier . The most effective strategy are proposed to address the three major barrier for each of these technology based on extensive discussion with all the stakeholder in the electricity industry . It wa found that lack of financing instrument , high initial cost and lack of assurance of resource supply or availability are the main barrier for renewable technology . As for cleaner fuel and technology option associated with conventional generation system , the lack of a clear government policy , uncertainty of fuel supply and their price and the reliability of the technology themselves are the major barrier . Strategies are identified to overcome the above barrier . Establishment of a proper feed in tariff , geographical diversification of installation and capacity building in commercial bank are suggested for wind power . Investment incentive , streamlining of wood production and research on site identification are proposed for wood fuel fired plant . Also the study suggests delayed implementation , combined planning with other sector of the economy , incorporating environmental cost in planning and investment incentive a strategy for IGCC and LNG based technology .

aVCarbon dioxide ( CO2 ) included in the exhaust gas from heat power plant is the chief cause of global warming . In the present study , we focused on the rotary adsorption tower filled with honeycomb-type adsorbent and conducted the following experiment and simulation . 1 . Preliminary experiment for ablation and condensation Of CO2 by thermal swing adsorption ( TSA ) method . 2 . Pilot plant test . 3 . Simulations of adsorption and desorption of CO2 for the system optimization . From the preliminary experiment , it wa clarified that the equilibrium adsorption Of CO2 followed the Langmuir model a a function of concentration and temperature , and the J factor for mass and heat transfer between gas and solid wa obtained a a function of Reynolds number . The CO2 recovery rate of the pilot plant , having an inner diameter of 460 mm , and height of adsorbent is 480 mm , could be greater than 80 % . These experimental result were compared with simulation result and showed good agreement . Furthermore , adsorption and desorption of CO2 were successfully simulated at each adsorption , heating , purge , and cooling stage . These result could be helpful guidance for the system optimization of rotary CO2 plant .

aVThe metric governing the trade-off between different greenhouse gas in the Kyoto Protocol , the Global Warming Potentials ( GWPs ) , ha received ample critique from both scientific and economic point of view . Here we use an integrated climate-economic optimization model to estimate the cost-effective trade-off between CO ( 2 ) , CH ( 4 ) and N ( 2 ) O when meeting a temperature stabilization target . We then estimate the increased cost from using GWPs when meeting the same temperature target . Although the efficient valuation of the gas differs significantly from their respective GWPs , the potential economic benefit of valuing them in a more correct way amount to 3.8 percent of the overall cost of meeting the temperature stabilization target in the base case . In absolute value , this corresponds to an additional net present value cost of US $ ( 2000 ) 100 billion . To corroborate our finding we perform a Monte Carlo-analysis where several key parameter are randomly varied simultaneously . The result from this exercise show that our main result is robust to a wide range of change in the key parameter value , giving a median economic loss from using GWPs of 4.2 percent .

aVThis paper summarises the trend of 943 phenological time-series of plant , fish and bird gathered from 1948 to 1999 in Estonia . More than 80 % of the studied phenological phase have advanced during springtime , whereas change are smaller during summer and autumn . Significant value of plant and bird phase have advanced 5-20 day , and fish phase have advanced 10-30 day in the spring period . Estonia 's average air temperature ha become significantly warmer in spring , while at the same time a slight decrease in air temperature ha been detected in autumn . The growing season ha become significantly longer in the maritime climate area of Western Estonia . The investigated phenological and climate trend are related primarily to change in the North Atlantic Oscillation Index ( NAOI ) during the winter month . Although the impact of the winter NAOI on the phase decrease towards summer , the trend of the investigated phase remain high . The trend of phenophases at the end of spring and the beginning of summer may be caused by the temperature inertia of the changing winter , change in the radiation balance or the direct consequence of human impact such a land use , heat island or air pollution .

aVSince the decomposition rate of soil organic carbon ( SOC ) varies a a function of environmental condition , global climate change is expected to alter SOC decomposition dynamic , and the resulting change in the amount of CO2 emitted from soil will feedback onto the rate at which climate change occurs . While this soil feedback is expected to be significant because the amount of SOC is substantially more than the amount of carbon in the atmosphere , the environmental dependency of decomposition at global scale that determine the magnitude of the soil feedback have remained poorly characterized . In this study , we address this issue by fitting a mechanistic decomposition model to a global dataset of SOC , optimizing the model 's temperature and moisture dependency to best match the observed global distribution of SOC . The result of the analysis indicate that the temperature sensitivity of decomposition at global scale ( Q ( 10 ) =1.37 ) is significantly le than is assumed by many terrestrial ecosystem model that directly apply temperature sensitivity from small-scale study , and that the maximal rate of decomposition occurs at higher moisture value than is assumed by many model . These finding imply that the magnitude of the soil decomposition feedback onto rate of global climate change will be le sensitive to increase in temperature , and modeling of temperature and moisture dependency of SOC decomposition in global-scale model should consider effect of scale .

aVThe 1987 Montreal Protocol is widely seen a a global environmental accord that ha produced tangible result in term of reduction in ozone-depleting substance . In addition , there have been other benefit , largely unrecognized and undocumented , that can best be characterized in a sustainable development framework based on a review of 50 out of 931 project implemented over a 13 year period by one of the four implementing agency of the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol . All investment project have reduced ozone depleting potential and global warming potential . Some project have reduced atmospheric emission and contamination of groundwater . Other project have increased the competitiveness of enterprise in domestic and international market and have sustained and in a few case created employment opportunity . Others , fewer in number , have potentially contributed to environmental problem , have initially created difficulty in maintaining productivity and quality standard and have decreased the number of employment opportunity because of the need to rationalize manufacturing process . The potential contribution from Multilateral Fund investment project to sustainable development could probably have been amplified with project design guidance for the technical staff of all three implementing agency executing investment project . In thinking about other multilateral environmental agreement , one can see the need for similar guidance for Global Environment Facility funded project supporting the focal area of climate change , international water , ozone depletion and persistent organic pollutant . Some of them have the potential to generate multiple beneficial impact in addition to their stated environmental objective if designed and implemented within a sustainable development framework .

aVThe decrease of biodiversity related to the phenomenon of global climate change is stimulating the scientific community towards a better understanding of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning . In ecosystem where marked biodiversity change occur at seasonal time scale , it is easier to relate them with ecosystem functioning . The objective of this work is to analyse the relationship between phytoplankton diversity and primary production in St. Andre coastal lagoon - SW Portugal . This lagoon is artificially opened to the sea every year in early spring , exhibiting a shift from a marine dominated to a low salinity ecosystem in winter . Data on salinity , temperature , nutrient , phytoplankton specie composition , chlorophyll a ( Chl a ) concentration and primary production were analysed over a year . Modelling study based on production-irradiance curve were also conducted . A total of 19 taxon were identified among diatom , dinoflagellate and euglenophyceans , the le abundant group . Lowest diversity ( Shannon-Wiener index ) were observed just before the opening to the sea . Results show a negative correlation ( p 90 % of cell abundance ) and production wa maximal ( up to 234.8 mg C m ( -3 ) h ( -1 ) ) . Maximal photosynthetic rate ( P ( max ) ) ( 2.0-22.5 mg C mg Chl a ( -1 ) h ( -1 ) ) were higher under lower Chl a concentration . The result of this work suggest that decrease in diversity are associated with increase in biomass and production , whereas increase correspond to opposite trend . It is suggested that these trend , contrary to those observed in terrestrial and in some benthic ecosystem , may be a result of low habitat diversity in the water column and resulting competitive pressure . The occurrence of the highest photosynthetic rate when Chl a is low , under some of the highest diversity , suggests a more efficient use of irradiance under low biomass-high diversity condition . Results suggest that this increased efficiency is not explained by potential reduction in nutrient limitation and intraspecific competition under lower biomass and may be a result of niche complementarity .

aVRecovery of CO2 from gas mixture is an important industrial objective in view of several aspect such a natural gas reforming , biomedical application and even global warming . Polyimides consisting of flexible polyethyleneoxide ( PEO ) segment and rigid polyimide segment have been reported in recent year for this application . They exhibit high CO2 permeability coefficient and relatively high CO2/N-2 selectivity due to CO2 strong affinity to the polar PEO segment . In this work a set of copolyimides with different content of PEO have been prepared from 3,3',4,4'-biphenyltetracarboxylic dianhydride , oxydianiline ( ODA ) and a diamine containing the PEO fragment . ODA-PEO ratio ( w : w ) used to prepare the polymer were 1 : 1 , 1:2 , 1:4 and 1:6 . Preliminary permeability measurement established that the membrane with the ODA-PEO ratio ( w : w ) 1:2 , which exhibited permeability of 23.87 and 0.39 Barrers , for CO2 and N-2 respectively , showed the highest ideal selectivity of CO2 over N-2 ( 61.20 ) when compared to the other member of the series . The thermal treatment of this membrane wa carried out in an oven heated at 200 degree C , 250 degree C and 300 degree C. The heating at 200 degree C caused a large increase in N2 and CO2 permeability coefficient ( 1.05 and 57.25 Barrers respectively ) which resulted in a slight decrease of the selectivity . It should be mentioned that while the permeability of CO2 increased considerably ( similar to 300 % ) , the selectivity just suffered a small drop ( similar to 10 % ) , and hence , the productivity of this membrane is much better after the thermal treatment . Thermal treatment of the membrane above 200 degree C produced successive increment on the permeability coefficient of both gas , while ideal selectivity wa maintained .

aVWe evaluated the effect of marine iguana , sally lightfoot crab , and fish on rocky-shore sessile organism at two site at Santa Cruz Island , Galapagos Islands , Ecuador , for 3-5 year during and after the 1997-1998 El Nino , using exclusion cage to separate the effect . Plots exposed to natural grazing were dominated either by encrusting algae or by red algal turf and articulated corallines . Algae fluctuated in response to El Nino in the following way . During an early phase , crustose Gymnogongrus and/or red algal turf were dominant . In the heart of El Nino , grazers had limited effect on algal cover but influenced algal size substantially . Most algae ( particularly edible form ) were scarce or declined , although warm-water ephemeral specie ( notably Giffordia mitchelliae ) flourished , increasing diversity and overgrowing crust . Iguana mortality were high , and crab density low . When normal condition returned , warm-water ephemeral declined , crab density rose , and grazers had significant but site-specific effect on algae . At one site , any combination of grazers diminished most erect specie , reducing diversity and restoring dominance of competitively inferior grazer-resistant crust . At a second site , only the combined effect of all grazers had this effect . Laboratory experiment confirmed that crab could control erect algae and promote crustose form , and crustose Gymnogongrus developed into an erect form in the absence of crab . Differences between site and large-scale temporal change associated with El Nino indicate that tropical shore are not all a constant in time and space a previously suggested . Mobile grazers did affect algal community , but over the period of our observation far greater effect were attributable to intersite difference and temporal shift in oceanographic condition . El Nino event reduce nutrient , intensify wave action , and raise sea level , affecting food availability for intertidal herbivore and their influence on benthic algae . Thus , the dramatic transformation of community during El Nino presage the impact of global climate change .

aVThe link between trade and the environment ha aroused considerable interest both in term of the impact of trade liberalisation on the environment , and also the impact of environmental policy on production and trade . Of key environmental concern at present is global warming and it association with greenhouse gas emission . Agriculture is a sector of the economy that both contributes to , and will be affected by , climate change . This paper model the impact of agricultural trade liberalisation on greenhouse gas emission from agriculture around the world , focusing particularly on the effect on New Zealand , a small economy highly dependent on agricultural trade . A partial equilibrium agricultural multicountry , multicommodity trade model is used for the analysis , extended to include physical production system and their greenhouse gas emission . Two simulation are performed : removal of agricultural policy in the EU and in all OECD country . The result indicate that although producer return in New Zealand increase , greenhouse gas emission also increase significantly . EU producer face lower return but also lower greenhouse gas emission .

aVThe ability of climate model to simulate large-scale temperature change during the twentieth century when they include both anthropogenic and natural forcings and their inability to account for warming over the last 50 yr when they exclude increasing greenhouse gas concentration ha been used a evidence for an anthropogenic influence on global warming . One criticism of the model used in many of these study is that they exclude some forcings of potential importance , notably from fossil fuel black carbon , biomass smoke , and land use change . Herein transient simulation with a new model , the Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model version 1 ( HadGEM1 ) , are described , which include these forcings in addition to other anthropogenic and natural forcings , and a fully interactive treatment of atmospheric sulfur and it effect on cloud . These new simulation support previous work by showing that there wa a significant anthropogenic influence on near-surface temperature change over the last century . They demonstrate that black carbon and land use change are relatively unimportant for explaining global mean near-surface temperature change . The pattern of warming in the troposphere and cooling in the stratosphere that ha been observed in radiosonde data since 1958 can only be reproduced when the model includes anthropogenic forcings . However , there are some discrepancy between the model simulation and radiosonde data , which are largest where observational uncertainty is greatest in the Tropics and high latitude . Predictions of future warming have also been made using the new model . Twenty-first-century warming rate , following policy-relevant emission scenario , are slightly greater in HadGEM1 than in the Third Hadley Centre Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere General Circulation Model ( HadCM3 ) a a result of the extra forcing in HadGEM1 . An experiment in which greenhouse gas and other anthropogenic forcings are stabilized at 2100 level and held constant until 2200 predicts a committed twenty-second-century warming of le than 1 K , whose spatial distribution resembles that of warming during the twenty-first century , implying that the local feedback that determine the pattern of warming do not change significantly .

aVThe hydrologic design standard for urban drainage system are commonly based on the frequency of occurrence of heavy rainfall event . Observations of recent climate history indicate that the frequency of occurrence of heavy rainfall event is increasing . This increasing trend will likely continue in the future due to global warming . In this study , extending from previous analysis result for Chicago , the rainfall intensity-duration-frequency ( IDF ) relationship were determined to represent the climate condition of the first and second half of the last century . Using these IDF relationship , the impact of the observed increase in heavy rainfall event on the design and performance of urban drainage system were quantified . This quantification demonstrated the need for updating rainfall IDF relationship to reflect changing climate condition . In the design of new and retrofitting or replacement of old urban drainage system , up to date IDF relationship need to be used to maintain design standard .

aVThe aim of this work wa to evaluate system making organic farm self-sufficient in farm-produced bio-based fuel . The energy balance and environmental load for system based on rape methyl ester ( RME ) , ethanol and biogas were evaluated using a life cycle perspective . Complete LCAs were not performed . Important constraint when implementing the system in practice were also identified . The RME scenario showed favourable energy balance and produced valuable by-product but wa le positive in some other aspect . The use of land wa high and thereby also the emission associated with cultivation . Emissions , with the exception of CO2 , during utilisation of the fuel were high compared to those of the other fuel in the study . The technology for production and use of RME is well known and easy to implement at farm scale . The production of ethanol wa energy consuming and the by-product were relatively low value . However , the area needed for cultivation of raw material wa low compared to the RME scenario . The production and utilisation of ignition improver and denaturant were associated with considerable emission . Suitable ethanol production technology is available but is more optimal for large scale system . The biogas scenario had a low relative need for arable land , which also resulted in smaller soil emission to air and water . Another advantage wa the potential to recycle plant nutrient . On the other hand , the potential emission of methane from storage of digestate , upgrading of biogas and methane loss during utilisation of fuel produced a negative impact , mainly on global warming . Small scale technology for biogas cleaning and storage is not fully developed and extensive tractor modification are necessary . The global warming effect of all three system studied were reduced by 58-72 % in comparison to a similar farming system based on diesel fuel . However , the fuel cost were higher for all scenario studied compared to current diesel price . In particular , the large cost for seasonal storage of gas meant that the biogas scenario described is currently not financially viable . ( c ) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVGlobal climate change is expected to have broad ecological consequence for specie and community . Attempts to forecast these consequence usually assume that change in air or water temperature will translate into equivalent change in a specie ' organismal body temperature . This simple change is unlikely because an organism 's body temperature is determined by a complex series of interaction between the organism and it environment . Using a biophysical model , validated with 5 year of field observation , we examined the relationship between environmental temperature change and body temperature of the intertidal mussel Mytilus califomianus over 1,600 km of it geographic distribution . We found that at all location examined simulated change in air or water temperature always produced le than equivalent change in the daily maximum mussel body temperature . Moreover , the magnitude of body temperature change wa highly variable , both within and among location . A simulated 1 degree C increase in air or water temperature raised the maximum monthly average of daily body temperature maximum by 0.07-0.92 degree C , depending on the geographic location , vertical position , and temperature variable . We combined these sensitivity with predicted climate change for 2100 and calculated increase in monthly average maximum body temperature of 0.97-4.12 degree C , depending on location and climate change scenario . Thus geographic variation in body temperature sensitivity can modulate specie ' experience of climate change and must be considered when predicting the biological consequence of climate change .

aVAnalysis of monthly mean river temperature , recorded on an hourly basis in the middle reach of the Loire since 1976 , allows reconstruction by multiple linear regression of the annual , spring and summer water temperature from equivalent information on air temperature and river discharge . Since 188 1 , the average annual and summer temperature of the Loire have risen by approximately 0.8 degree C. this increase accelerating since the late 1980s due to the rise in air temperature and also to lower discharge rate . In addition . the thermal regime in the Orleans to Blois reach is considerably affected by the inflow of groundwater from the Calcaires de Beauce aquifer , a shown by the summer energy balance .

aVThe amount of solar irradiance reaching the surface is a key parameter in the hydrological and energy cycle of the Earth 's climate . We analyze 20th Century simulation using nine state-of-the-art climate model and show that all model estimate a global annual mean reduction in downward surface solar radiation of 1-4 W/m ( 2 ) at the same time that the globe warms by 0.4-0.7 degree C. In single forcing simulation using the GISS-ER model , this `` global dimming '' signal is shown to be predominantly related to aerosol effect . In the global mean sense the surface adjusts to change in downward solar flux instantaneously by reducing the upward flux of longwave , latent and sensible heat . Adding increased greenhouse gas forcing trap outgoing longwave radiation in the atmosphere and surface which result in net heating ( although reduced ) that is consistent with global warming over the 20th Century . Over the 1984-2000 period , individual model simulation show widely disparate result , mostly related to cloud change associated with tropical Pacific variation , similar to the change inferred from the satellite data analysis . This suggests that this time period is not sufficient to determine longer term trend .

aVThe sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima host two phylogenetically different symbiotic microalgae , a dinoflagellate Symbiodinium ( zooxanthellae , ZX ) and a chlorophyte ( zoochlorellae , ZC ) . The photosynthetic productivity ( P ) , respiration ( R ) , and contribution of algal carbon translocated to the host ( CZAR ) in response to a year 's seasonal ambient change of natural light and temperature are documented for both ZX- and ZC-bearing anemone . Light and temperature both affect photosynthesis , respiration , and CZAR , a well a various algal parameter ; while there are evident seasonal difference , for the most part the relative effect on P , R , and CZAR by the two environmental variable can not be determined . Net photosynthesis ( P-n ) of both ZX and ZC wa significantly higher during spring and summer . During these season , the P-n of ZX wa always greater than that of ZC . Regardless of algal symbiont , anemone respiration ( R ) wa significantly higher during the spring and summer . The annual net carbon fixation rate of anemone with ZX and ZC wa 325 and 276 mg C anemone ( -1 ) year ( -1 ) , respectively , which translates to annual net community productivity rate of 92 and 60 g C m ( -1 ) year ( -1 ) for anemone with ZX or ZC , respectively . CZAR did not show a clear relationship with season ; however the CZAR for ZX wa always significantly greater than for ZC . Lower ZX growth rate , coupled with higher photosynthetic rate and higher CZAR estimate , compared to ZC , suggest that if A. elegantissima is simply carbon limited , ZX-bearing anemone should be the dominant symbiont in the field . However ZC-bearing anemone persist in low light and reduced temperature microhabitats , therefore more than the translocation of carbon from ZC must be involved . Given that global climate change will increase water temperature , the potential for latitudinal range shift of both ZC and ZX ( S. californium and muscatinei ) might be used a biological indicator of thermal shift in the littoral zone of the Pacific Northwest .

aVThe energy balance of Phaeodactylum tricomutum , cell from photon to biomass have been analysed under nutrient-replete and N-limiting condition in combination with fluctuating ( FL ) and non-fluctuating ( SL ) dynamic light . For this purpose , the amount of photon absorbed ha been related to electron transported by photosystem 11 , to gas exchange rate , and to the newly formed biomass differentially resolved into carbohydrate , protein , and lipid measured by mean of Fourier transform infrared ( FTIR ) spectroscopy . Under high nutrient condition , the quantum efficiency of carbon-related biomass production ( ( Phi c ) and the metabolic cost of carbon ( C ) production were found to be strongly controlled by the light climate . Under N-limited condition , the light climate wa le important for the efficieny of primary production . Thus , the largest range of ( Phi c dependent on the nutrient status of the cell wa observed under non-fluctuating light condition which are comparable with stratified condition in the natural environment . It is evident that N limitation induced pronounced change in the composition of macromolecular compound and , thus , influenced the degree of reduction of the biomass a well a the metabolic cost of C production . However , ( Dc and the metabolic cost are not predictable from the photosynthesis rate . In consequence , the result clearly show that bio-optical method a well a gas exchange measurement during the light phase can severely mismatch the true energy storage in the biomass especially under high nutrient in combination with non-fluctuating light condition .

aVA descriptive study wa carried out in the district of the Lake Geneva between March 1 , 2005 and August 31,2006 to ass the incidence and prevalence of canine babesiosis , to genotype the Babesia specie occurring , to ass the most frequently clinical sign found and to address the potential of autochthonous transmission . This included a data assessment on the different tick-populations occurring in the area and on the prevalence of Babesia-DNA in these tick . A total of 56 veterinary practice participated in the study . By blood smear and PCI , Babesia canis canis wa found in 12 out of 21 case with suspected babesiosis . In an additional 13th case , the parasite could only be detected by PCR . All autochthonous case originated from the Western part of the Lake Geneva region . Clinical sign in affected dog included inappetence , apathy , anemia , fever , hemoglobinuria and thron-ibocytopenia . There were no risk factor with regard to age , sex and breed . Most case were diagnosed during the spring period of 2005 and 2006 ( 11 case ) and two case in autumn 2005 , coinciding with the main activity period of Dermacentor reticulatus , the main vector of B. canis canis . A total of 495 tick were collected on patient by the veterinarian , 473 were identified a Ixodes sp. , 7 a khipicephalus sanguineus and 15 a Dermacentor reticulatus . While Nodes sp . wa found in the whole study area , D. reticulatus and R. sanguineus occurred only in the Western part till Lausanne . PCR and sequencing yielded B. canis canis positivity in 3 D. reticulatus specimen , these three tick were collected from two different dog both suffering from babesiosis . All R. sanguineus were negative by Babesia-PCR . Global warming , ecological change in the potential habitat of tick , increasing host- and vector-populations and increasing mobility of dog owner may be responsible for an emergence situation of infection risk for Babesia spp . by time . E.g. , Dermacentor reticulatus ha become autochtonously prevalent already till Lausanne in the Lake Geneva region , and further surveillance is suggested to tackle this problem .

aVUnderstanding the mechanism of tree anchorage in a forest is a priority because of the increase in wind storm in recent year and their projected recurrence a a consequence of global warming . To characterize anchorage mechanism during tree uprooting , we developed a generic finite element model where real three-dimensional ( 3D ) root system architecture were represented in a 3D soil . The model wa used to simulate tree overturning during wind loading , and result compared with real data from two poplar specie ( Populus trichocarpa and P. deltoides ) . These tree were winched sideways until failure , and uprooting force and root architecture measured . The uprooting force wa higher for P. deltoides than P. trichocarpa , probably due to it higher root volume and thicker lateral root . Results from the model showed that soil type influence failure mode . In frictional soil , e.g. , sandy soil , plastic failure of the soil occurred mainly on the windward side of the tree . In cohesive soil , e.g. , clay soil , a more symmetrical slip surface wa formed . Root system were more resistant to uprooting in cohesive soil than in frictional soil . Applications of this generic model include virtual uprooting experiment , where each component of anchorage can be tested individually .

aV[ 1 ] We propose a methodological approach to characterize the resilience of aquatic ecosystem with respect to the evolution of environmental parameter a well a their aptitude to adapt to forcings . This method that is applied to Lake Annecy , France , proceeds in three stage . First , according to the depth , variation of physicochemical parameter versus time are separated into three component related to ( 1 ) energy transfer through the surface of the lake , ( 2 ) the flow of river and spring that feed the lake , and ( 3 ) long-term evolution of the benthic zone a a consequence of mineral and organic matter load . Second , dynamic of the lake are deduced by analyzing the physicochemical parameter component related to the three boundary condition . Third , a stochastic process associated with the transfer model aim to characterize the resilience of the lake according to forcings . For Lake Annecy , whose dynamic are representative of oligotrophic stratified lake controlled by decarbonation process where turnover and mixing occurring once a year in winter , the major consequence is the impoverishment of dissolved oxygen in deep water in autumn due to a temperature increase of the surface water in summer . The simulation raise relevant question about whether a connection exists between physicochemical parameter and global warming , which should not induce harmful consequence on water quality and biodiversity in deep water . This methodological approach is general since it doe not use any physical conceptual model to predict the hydrosystem behavior but us directly observed data .

aVGlobal warming is a result of increasing anthropogenic CO2 emission , and the consequence will be dramatic climate change if no action is taken . One of the main global challenge in the year to come is therefore to reduce the CO2 emission . Increasing energy efficiency and a transition to renewable energy a the major energy source can reduce CO2 emission , but such measure can only lead to significant emission reduction in the long-term . Carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) is a promising technological option for reducing CO2 emission on a shorter time scale . A model to calculate the CO2 capture potential ha been developed , and it is estimated that 25 billion tonne CO2 can be captured and stored within the EU by 2050 . Globally , 236 billion tonne CO2 can be captured and stored by 2050 . The calculation indicate that wide implementation of CCS can reduce CO2 emission by 54 % in the EU and 33 % globally in 2050 compared to emission level today . Such a reduction in emission is not sufficient to stabilize the climate . Therefore , the strategy to achieve the necessary CO2 emission reduction must be a combination of ( 1 ) increasing energy efficiency , ( 2 ) switching from fossil fuel to renewable energy source , and ( 3 ) wide implementation of CCS .

aVThe current Norwegian climate research structure , policy and priority , mitigation and adaptation option are discussed a well a the development of local climate change projection and adaptation measure . A major difficulty is that Norway 's present energy supply ha a low carbon intensity because a substantial part derives from hydropower , but increasing demand may be met by gas-fired electricity generation , thereby making efficiency and conservation a much higher priority . A National Action Plan on Climate Research recognizes the need for increased research effort in several area , including the impact on the built environment and the more general impact on society . Mitigation opportunity for reducing greenhouse gas emission within the built environment include increased technological efficiency , reduced energy usage through improved design , mandatory labelling scheme and a switch to climate neutral fuel for heating . However , radically lower energy requirement and lower U-values will be problematic , requiring new technical solution and construction method . There is little integration of policy and strategy for adaptation in Norway . The recognition that climate change will further enhance an array of different , harsh microclimates in Norway , which vary according to individual locality , ha led to the development of new adaptation approach and method . These allow for the projected local climate to inform decision on an appropriate design response to meet performance-based code . The development of design guidance for high-performance building envelope will , in future , take account of projected local climate . However , there is a tension between the need for standardized national building solution and the need to adapt to local climatic condition .

aVWhile it is widely appreciated that climate can affect the population dynamic of various specie , a mechanistic understanding of how climate interacts with life-history trait to influence population fluctuation requires development . Here we build a general density-dependent age-structured model that account for differential response in life-history trait to increasing population density . We show that a the temporal frequency of favorable environmental condition increase , population fluctuation also increase provided that unfavorable environmental condition still occur . As good year accumulate and the number of individual in a population increase , successive life-history trait become vulnerable to density dependence once a return to unfavorable condition prevails . The stronger this ratcheting of density dependence in life-history trait by autocorrelated climatic condition , the larger the population fluctuation become . Highly fecund specie , and those in which density dependence occurs in juvenile and adult vital rate at similar density , are most sensitive to increase in the frequency of favorable condition . Understanding the influence of global warming on temporal correlation in regional environmental condition will be important in identifying those specie liable to exhibit increased population fluctuation that could lead to their extinction .

aVRegional precipitation anomaly under El Nino or global warming scenario manifest considerable spatial variability , especially in the vicinity of tropical deep convective zone . Using a simplified set of equation , we develop an analytic prototype of convective margin for tropical land region subject to inflow from adjacent ocean region . The approach yield an expression for the location of the convective margin from which it is straightforward to deduce how climate perturbation impact the margin . We compare the result of the prototype to full model simulation of the equatorial South American precipitation response to El Nino forcing and find general agreement . Analysis of the observation support the convective inflow margin prototype 's applicability to appropriately simple basic state configuration .

aVRuminant livestock system contribute to global warming through the emission of nitrous oxide ( N ( 2 ) O ) , methane ( CH ( 4 ) ) and carbon dioxide ( CO , ) . This paper discus a general framework for a whole-farm approach to develop cost-effective GHG mitigation strategy . A dairy farm is a complex system with different interacting component . Generally , whole-farm approach distinguish at least an animal component and a soil-crop component . Whole-farm model should be able to give an accurate representation of the internal cycling of material and it constituent a well a the exchange between the farming system and it environment . The paper give an overview of current whole-farm model that are able to simulate GHG emission for dairy farm . These model are DairySim , FarmGHG , SIMS ( DAIRY ) and FarmSim . All model are able to calculate CH ( 4 ) and N ( 2 ) O emission , but difference appear in the ability to calculate CO , emission , economics and other parameter . The effect of selected mitigation strategy are demonstrated with some of the model . It is concluded that a whole-farm approach is a powerful tool for the development of cost-effective GHG mitigation option a it reveals relevant interaction between farm component . Model calculation underlined the relationship between farm gate N surplus and GHG emission , and thus the possibility to use N surplus a an indicator for GHG emission . ( C ) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

aVIn this work , the ability of a recently proposed statistical associating fluid theory of variable range ( SAFT VR ) version to estimate thermophysical property of fluorinated compound is demonstrated , focusing specially on second-order derivative property . These property are fundamental in the simulation and design of the industrial process where these family of compound find application a working fluid , but only very recently ha their estimation been accomplished with the desired degree of accuracy , a they have been traditionally considered a a severely stringent test to any thermodynamic model . With this aim , a complete thermophysical characterization of two hydrofluoroethers , included among the so-called third generation of chlorofluorocarbon alternative , with low global warming potential and zero ozone depletion potential , are presented . To achieve this goal , measurement of compressed-liquid density and the speed of sound were performed in high-pressure condition and set a the basis for the determination of molecular parameter of a version of the statistical associating fluid theory for chain molecule with attractive potential of variable range ( SAFT VR ) equation of state . This coupling between accurate experimental determination of high pressure , density , and the speed of sound and the calculation of characteristic molecular parameter in the framework of a physically sound molecular model allows a complete description of the thermophysical behavior of the pure fluid studied , providing a precise simultaneous estimation of phase equilibrium and other first- and second-order derivative property , ensuring the reliability of the proposed characterization procedure . The relevance of the accurate experimental data is to be emphasized , a without the right experimental input , the applied model , accurate a it eventually is shown to be , would never achieve it maximum performance , a it will be discussed in the following .

aVPerspectives are offered for reducing the impact of huge amount of CO2 produced today from power generation and transportation vehicle . The origin of the dilemma between the world 's increasing use of hydrocarbon a an energy source and the cogeneration of CO2 which result a a co-product are discussed . Hydrocarbons will provide much of the fuel need for these major , global industry for the next 20 year and meet 60 % of the world 's energy demand . With the growth of both power generation and transportation vehicle around the world , CO2 level will continue to increase in the atmosphere . Renewables such a wind , dam , and biomass will not be able to handle all the energy demand . Technology breakthrough are needed to reduce the world 's dependence on fossil fuel , which will be aggravated by the drive to use more coal . Current approach for removing CO2 are discussed a well a near term and future option with particular focus on how catalysis can offer some solution . In particular , solar photocatalysis based approach offer a potentially viable energy solution .

aVThe complete meltdown of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheet would raise the sea level 65 meter , whereas a partial meltdown only a few ten of meter . Eustatic sea level rate of change in Greenland since 2003 show a net ice mass reduction of 96 gigatons per year ; with this , geologist are called upon to add a historical perspective upon these change . Pre-Neogene continental rearrangement occurred at numerous episode , masking the net effect of eustatic level fluctuation . Glacial advance is prominent during late Precambrian , late Carboniferous and Pleistocene . Greenhouse event and temperature increase are evident during the Devonian and Cretaceous . Paleo-continental landmass position reveal a direct relationship to icehouse and greenhouse event . The restriction of global oceanic circulation at the equator brings about icehouse event . Absolute rate of change for comparison purpose to the present are currently impossible due to the multivariate effect ( 1 ) tectonic plate motion world wide ; ( 2 ) variation in sedimentary process ; ( 3 ) diagenetic change in sedimentary rock ; ( 4 ) subsidence , on the resultant stratigraphic record . Since carbonate reef reach the top of the subsea or photic zone , carbonate reef grow , t. , It is an ideal indicator of sea level change . Carbonate deposit at the Caribbean - South America plate boundary are a prime example that plate motion can greatly supersede sea level fluctuation . The best area to use carbonate reef data is along the Florida-Babamas-Caribbean passive margin of the Atlantic basin , where Neogene tectonics and carbonate deposition were stable . The carbon dioxide level were much greater above the K/T boundary , creating an environment devoid of significant carbonate buildup . The earliest significant quantitative sea-level rate of change data is derived from well drilled into stable carbonate platform of the late Neogene 2-7 Ma , when carbon dioxide level decreased in the atmosphere . Cores show rate of paleo sea level rise averaging 10 to 20cm/100yr versus currently between 17-32cm/100yr . The rate increase ha nearly doubled within the past 14 year . This increased rate of change in sea-level ha been recently highlighted at the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in Paris , France . In the past , rapid warming caused extreme increase in eustatic sea level rate of change reflected in geochemical data from carbonate Holocene reef core from the west side of Barbados Island , drowned reef off the Florida coast , and from Bermuda . The measuring sea level change of 1-2m/100yr are evident from 13,000-17,000 year ago . The warming is attributed to solar irradiance at glacial maximum during the Wisconsinan 14,000-20,000 year before present when sea level wa a much a -175 meter lower than today . This lowered sea level evidence is derived from Holocene reef south of the Great Barrier Reef in Australia . Bluemle ( 2001 ) characterizes the Holocene a a sequence of ten or more global scale `` little ice age '' fairly irregularly spaced , each lasting a few century and separated by global warming event shown from the ice core data . Friedman ( 2005 ) noted an overall cooling trend in ocean water based on Red Sea beach rock geochemical data from 7,000 to 2,000 year ago . Through all the erratic temperature swing over the past 4,000 year geochemical data from Holocene reef core from Florida show a sea level rise of 12cm/100yr. , typical of stable geological and climatological period . The Questions remains : Is the current rate change of sea level significant or , just another unanswered anomaly from the cycle curve ? .

aVDuring the last century , the refrigeration industry wa forced to change refrigerant technology due to commitment to the Montreal protocol . The industry is redesigning technology towards the application of new environment friendly refrigerant that may be used forum longer period . Refrigerants Should be chlorine free , which mean that they do not have impact on the ozone layer , and at the same time they should have low global warming potential . Emphasis in this paper is given to the use of carbon-dioxide R744 and ammonia R717 because of their low impact oil the atmosphere . The cascade system technology is known with CO2 a the refrigerant in the first stage and NH3 a the refrigerant in the second stage of the cascade . This paper elaborates the use of CO2 in the transcritical area , i.e . above the critical point where there is no vapour condensation . The paper deal also with problem connected with high working pressure of CO2 thermodynamic property and design of transcritical heat pump and their component . Compared to other refrigerant , CO2 ha one specific property : low critical temperature 31,1 degree C at 73,8 bar . The operating pressure for gas cooling will be extremely high , above 100 bar . In the subcritical area the enthalpy change is influenced by the temperature change , while in transcritical area enthalpy change is affected by pressure . In the transcritical area , the coefficient of performance may be controlled by the refrigerant pressure after compression .

aVLooked at in a simplistic way , aerosol have counteracted the warming effect of greenhouse gas ( GHG ) over the past century . This ha not only provided some climate protection ' , but also prevented the true magnitude of the problem from becoming evident . In particular , it may have resulted in an underestimation of the sensitivity of the climate system to the effect of GHG . Over the present century , the role of aerosol in opposing global warming will wane , a there are powerful policy reason to reduce their emission and their atmospheric lifetime are short in contrast to those of the GHG . On the other hand , aerosol will continue to play a role in regional climate change , especially with regard to the water cycle . The end of significant climate protection by atmospheric aerosol , combined with the potentially very high sensitivity of the climate system , make sharp and prompt reduction in greenhouse gas emission , especially CO2 , very urgent .

aVThe increase in the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide is considered to be one of the main cause of global warming . As estimated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) criterion , about 10-15 % of the gas emitted from the combustion coal being in the form of carbon dioxide . Microalgae and cyanobacteria can contribute to the reduction of atmospheric carbon dioxide by using this gas a carbon source . We cultivated the Scenedesmus obliquus and Spirulina sp . at 30 degree C in a temperature-controlled three-stage serial tubular photobioreactor and determined the resistance of these organism to limitation and excess of carbon dioxide and the capacity of the system to fix this greenhouse gas . After 5 day of cultivation under condition of carbon limitation both organism showed cell death . Spirulina sp . presenting better result for all parameter than S. obliquus . For Spirulina sp . the maximum specific growth rate and maximum productivity wa 0.44 d ( -1 ) , 0.22 g L-1 d ( -1 ) , both with 6 % ( v/v ) carbon dioxide and maximum cellular concentration wa 3.50 g L-1 with 12 % ( v/v ) carbon dioxide . Maximum daily carbon dioxide biofixation wa 53.29 % for 6 % ( v/v ) carbon dioxide and 45.61 % for 12 % carbon dioxide to Spirulina sp . corresponding value for S. obliquus being 28.08 % for 6 % ( v/v ) carbon dioxide and 13.56 % for 12 % ( v/v ) carbon dioxide . The highest mean carbon dioxide fixation rate value wa 37.9 % to Spirulina sp . in the 6 % carbon dioxide run . ( c ) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All right reserved .

aVUnderstanding the effect of global climate change on regional air quality is central in future air quality planning . We report here on the use of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies ( GISS ) general circulation model ( GCM ) III to drive the GEOS-CHEM global atmospheric chemical transport model to simulate climatological present-day aerosol level over the United States . Evaluation of model prediction using surface measurement from the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments ( IMPROVE ) network indicates that the GISS GCM III/GEOS-CHEM model is a suitable tool for simulating aerosol over the United States in the present climate . The model reproduces fairly well the concentration of sulfate ( mean bias of -0.36 mu g m ( -3 ) , normalized mean bias ( NMB ) of -25.9 % ) , black carbon ( -0.004 mu g m ( -3 ) , -1.9 % ) , organic carbon that comprises primary and secondary component ( -0.56 mu g m ( -3 ) , -34.2 % ) , and PM ( 2.5 ) ( -0.87 mu g m ( -3 ) , -20.4 % ) . Nitrate concentration are overpredicted in the western United States ( west of 95 degree W ) with a NMB of +75.6 % and underestimated in the eastern United States with a NMB of -54.4 % . Special attention is paid to biogenic secondary organic aerosol ( SOA ) . The highest predicted seasonal mean SOA concentration of 1-2 mu g m ( -3 ) and 0.5-1.5 mu g m ( -3 ) are predicted over the northwestern and southeastern United States , respectively , in the month of June-July-August . Isoprene is predicted to contribute 49.5 % of the biogenic SOA burden over the United States , with the rest explained by the oxidation of terpene . Predicted biogenic SOA concentration are in reasonable agreement with inferred SOA level from IMPROVE measurement . On an annual basis , SOA is predicted to contribute 10-20 % of PM2.5 mass in the southeastern United States , a high a 38 % in the northwest and about 5-15 % in other region , indicating the important role of SOA in understanding air quality and visibility over the United States .

aVIn a burn of 5-year-old secondary forest cleared for agriculture in Roraima , Brazil , carbon partitioning wa measured for above-ground portion of both secondary forest ( regrowth ) and the remains of original forest , felled and burned six year previously . Above-ground dry weight biomass averaged 43.0 +/- 6.5 Mg ( megagrams=metric ton ) per hectare ( Mg ha ( -1 ) ) for secondary forest and 105.8 +/- 23.7 Mg ha ( -1 ) for original forest remains . Pre- and post-burn above-ground biomass loading were estimated by cutting and weighing six 60-m ( 2 ) plot and by line-intersect sampling ( LIS ) done along the axis of each post-burn plot ( three transects ) , plus two supplementary LIS transects . High variability of initial biomass made LIS more reliable for assessing change in material > 10 cm in diameter ; quantity for diameter class < 10 cm relied on direct weighing . Above-ground carbon pool were reduced by 67.8 % in secondary forest and 32.0 % in original forest remains . Burning released 28.8 Mg C ha ( -1 ) ( original forest remains plus secondary forest biomass ) , or 41.6 % of the pre-burn total carbon stock in biomass . The remainder of the carbon either remained a residual biomass ( 39.2 Mg C ha ( -1 ) or 56.5 % of pre-burn C ) or a charcoal and ash ( 1.4 Mg C ha ( -1 ) or 2.0 % ) . Carbon stock in charcoal increased from 0.50 Mg C ha ( -1 ) to 1.07 Mg C ha ( -1 ) , a net gain of 0.57 Mg C ha ( -1 ) , or 0.8 % of the pre-burn above-ground carbon stock . The net gain of charcoal carbon wa composed of 0.21 Mg C ha ( -1 ) from secondary forest biomass and 0.36 Mg C ha ( -1 ) from original forest remains ; 1.1 % of the above-ground secondary forest carbon wa converted to charcoal , while the corresponding percentage for original forest remains wa 0.7 % . Ashes contained an additional 0.29 Mg C ha ( -1 ) , of which 0.11 Mg C ha ( -1 ) can be attributed to secondary forest biomass and 0.18 Mg C ha ( -1 ) to original forest remains . If the carbon in ash is assumed to be finely powdered charcoal , this stock add 0.21 % to the charcoal formation percentage for secondary forest and 0.36 % to that for original forest remains . The overall charcoal-formation percentage wa 1.6 % , or 2.0 % if ash are included . Charcoal-formation percentage in this study are lower than those sometimes assumed in global carbon model ; nevertheless , charcoal can represent an important sink of atmospheric carbon over long time scale .

aVEthanol use in Brazil a a motor fuel ha been largely promoted since the two oil shock of the 1970s , either a a gasoline additive ( anhydrous ethanol ) or a a gasoline substitute ( hydrated ethanol ) . As of today , the uncertainty in the international oil market , the methyl tertiary butyl ether ( MTBE ) ban in the US and the growing concern with global climate change , all justify the quest for a new role to be played by ethanol worldwide . The current prevailing view see ethanol a a real threat to gasoline and , eventually , to oil itself . This paper examines this issue and concludes that by replacing mainly MTBE and not allowing the use of improved Otto engine , E10 ( gasohol blend ) doe not pose any serious treat to the oil industry , nor do flexfuel vehicle using fairly typical gasoline engine and , in the lack of ethanol supply , running on gasoline . On the other hand , if Otto engine at compression ratio found in diesel engine are promoted , then E30 could become a suitable strategy for spreading the use of ethanol fuel in large volume and also for saving gasoline . This paper proposes coupling policy of blending ethanol with gasoline , with policy aiming at saving fuel use in light duty vehicle ( LDV ) . ( C ) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVSoils are responsible for storing up to 75 % of forest carbon uptake making them extremely large carbon pool . However , soil carbon is eventually released to the atmosphere by below ground respiration , consisting of soil respiration ( microbial activity ) and root respiration , which is influenced by environmental climate variable ( soil temperature and moisture ) , soil characteristic ( chemical and physical property ) and stand characteristic ( stand age ) . We investigated the impact of stand age of cool temperate mountain ash forest ( E. regnans ) in Wallaby Creek , Victoria on carbon cycling between the soil and atmosphere using a chronosequence of three site of different age ( regrowth from bushfires in 1730 , 1926 and 1983 ) . Below ground respiration wa measured between January ( Summer ) and May ( Autumn ) in 2005 across all three site , with the highest rate found in the old growth forest ( 5.3 mu mol CO2 m ( -2 ) s ( -1 ) ) and with lowest rate in the youngest site ( 2.9 mu mol CO2 m ( -2 ) S-1 ) . Within site , below ground respiration rate increased with temperature , with Q 10 value ranging between 1.42 and 1.55 . Rates were further influenced by soil moisture , and soil physical and chemical property , including root biomass and level of soil carbon . Litterfall wa also measured and wa highest at the youngest site ( 140 g biomass m ( -2 ) month ( -1 ) ) and lowest ( 92 g biomass m ( -2 ) month ( -1 ) ) at the old growth site . Greater understanding of forest carbon cycling will result in an improved understanding of forest and their influence on global warming . Crown Copyright ( C ) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.

aVThe current issue of global warming and the role of the ocean in global exchange of CO ( 2 ) increase the interest in solid budget of marine carbonate production and dissolution . The present study utilizes grain-size composition of pelagic sediment in order to trace spatial and temporal variability of carbonate sedimentation in the South Atlantic for the Holocene and Last Glacial Maximum ( LGM , 19-23 cal kyr BP ) . A decrease in grain size ( e.g . sand content , mean grain size of coarse carbonate silt ) indicates increased carbonate dissolution a a result of increased fragmentation of calcareous microfossil . The spatial grain-size pattern suggests a threshold water depth below which a gradual grain-size decrease becomes increasingly rapid . This water depth is considered a the sedimentary lysocline . For the Holocene time slice , a constant , gradual decrease of foraminifer carbonate of about 5-10 % per 1000 m water depth above the lysocline give evidence for supra-lysoclinal dissolution . The water depth of the lysocline for the Holocene is tied to the interface of North Atlantic Deep Water and Antarctic Bottom Water ( AABW ) ( ca 4100 m ) . Submarine ridge which restrict intrusion of AABW into the Angola Basin cause an asymmetry in carbonate preservation across the Mid-Atlantic Ridge . The lysocline wa reconstructed at ca 3100 m for the LGM . These data suggest that the ca 1000 m rise of the lysocline eradicated the Holocene east-west asymmetry .

aVThe mechanism by which climate affect recruitment and loss of plant and the interaction between those plant and other organism ( e.g. , pathogen , granivores , seed dispersers ) have seldom been studied in the context of plant response to climate change . We examined how climate influence Jeffrey pine ( Pines jeffreyi ) recruitment , mortality , and specie interaction at three elevation zone ( low , mid , high ) across it elevation range ( 1550-2470 m ) in the semi-arid Carson Range of western Nevada . Local climate wa correlated with several aspect of stand structure , including smaller tree , slower growth rate , greater predation by seed insect , and higher tree mortality at low elevation . Cone crop wa not affected by elevation , but there were more mature tree and more filled seed per cone at mid- and high elevation . Populations of seed-caching rodent were largest at mid-elevation , but sufficient rodent were present at all elevation to cause rapid removal and dispersal of pine seed . Seedling emergence from rodent cache wa greatest at low and middle elevation , but seedling survival wa best at middle and high elevation . The number of sapling wa greatest at mid-elevation site . These result suggest a retracting population at low elevation ( high adult tree mortality and low recruitment ) , a rapidly expanding population at mid-elevation ( low adult tree mortality and high recruitment ) , and a slowly expanding population at high elevation ( low adult tree mortality and low recruitment ) . These demographic pattern foreshadow a shift in distribution upslope over future decade , driven by change in climate and facilitated by biotic interaction . ( c ) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

aVBecause the Khumbu Himal of the Nepal Himalayas lack long-term climate record from weather station , mountain permafrost degradation serf a an important indicator of climate warming . In 1973 , the permafrost lower limit wa estimated to be 5200-5300 m above sea level ( ASL ) on southern-aspect slope in this region . Using ground-temperature measurement , we examined the mountain permafrost lower limit on slope with the same aspect in 2004 . The result indicate that the permafrost lower limit wa 5400-5500 in ASL in 2004 . The permafrost lower limit wa estimated to be 5400 to 5500 to on slope with a southern aspect in the Khumbu Himal in 1991 using seismic reflection sounding . Thus , it is possible that the permafrost lower limit ha risen 100-300 m between 1973 and 1991 , followed by a stable limit of 5400 to 5500 m over the last decade . All increase in mean annual air temperature of approximately 0.2 to 0.4 degree C from the 1970s to the 1990s ha indicated a rise in the permafrost lower limit of 40 to 80 in at the Tibetan Plateau . The rise in the mountain permafrost lower limit in the Khumbu Himal exceeds that of the Tibetan Plateau , suggesting the possibility of greater climate warming in the Khumbu Himal .

aVUrban area are significant contributor to global carbon dioxide emission . Vehicle emission and other anthropogenic related activity are a frequent source Of CO2 to the atmosphere , contributing to global warming . Micrometeorological technique used for observation in Northern Hemisphere city have found that urban CO2 flux are consistently a source . This study investigates CO2 flux in an Australian city , adding to the global database of CO2 flux in a bid to aid in future development of planning policy concerning reduction in CO2 emission . Using the eddy covariance approach , flux Of CO2 were measured at a suburban site ( Preston ) in Melbourne , Australia from February 2004 to June 2005 to investigate temporal variability . A second site ( Surrey Hills ) with differing surface characteristic ( in particular , greater vegetation cover ) wa also established in Melbourne and ran simultaneously for 6 month ( February 2004-July 2004 ) . Results showed that both site were a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere . Diurnal pattern of flux were largely influenced by traffic volume , with two distinct peak occurring at the morning and evening traffic peak hour , with the winter morning peak averaging 10.9 mu mol m ( -2 ) s ( -1 ) at Preston . Summer time flux were lower than during winter due to greater vegetative influence and reduced natural gas combustion . Vegetation limited the source of CO2 in the afternoon , yet wa not enough to combat the strong local anthropogenic emission . Surrey Hills showed higher flux Of CO2 despite greater vegetation cover because of higher local traffic volume . Annual emission from Preston were estimated at 84.9 t CO2 ha ( -1 ) yr ( -1 ) . Magnitudes and pattern of suburban CO2 flux in Melbourne were similar to those observed in Northern Hemisphere suburban area . ( c ) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVA single adult Coccinella novemnotata ( the nine-spotted lady beetle ) wa recently discovered by a Cornell University student amongst a series of specimen collected in early October 2006 in Arlington , Virginia . The specimen is the first individual collected in eastern North America in over fourteen year and is only the sixth of it specie known to be collected anywhere in North America in the last ten year . This discovery reopens question regarding the current status of this once common specie . Interactions with exotic specie , global climate change , and shifting land use pattern have all been postulated a possible factor in this specie decline . This discovery is the first in a new program in the USA designed to educate the public regarding biodiversity and conservation and to engage them in a survey of native and exotic lady beetle specie .

aVPalaeoclimate data show that the Earth 's climate is remarkably sensitive to global forcings . Positive feedback predominate . This allows the entire planet to be whipsawed between climate state . One feedback , the 'albedo flip ' property of ice/water , provides a powerful trigger mechanism . A climate forcing that 'flips ' the albedo of a sufficient portion of an ice sheet can spark a cataclysm . Inertia of ice sheet and ocean provides only moderate delay to ice sheet disintegration and a burst of added global warming . Recent greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emission place the Earth perilously close to dramatic climate chan-e that could run out of our control . with great danger for human and other creature . Carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) is the largest human-made climate forcing , but other trace constituent are also important . Only intense simultaneous effort to Slow CO2 emission and reduce non-Co-2 forcings can keep climate within or near the range of the past million year . The most important of the non-CO2 forcings is methane ( CH4 ) , a it cause the second largest human-made GHG climate forcing and is the principal cause of increased tropospheric ozone ( 03 ) , which is the third largest GHG forcing . Nitrous oxide ( N2O ) should also be a focus of climate mitigation effort . Black carbon ( 'black soot ' ) ha a high global warming potential ( approx . 2000 , 500 and 200 for 20 , 100 and 500 , year , respectively ) and deserves greater attention . Some forcings are especially effective at high latitude , so concerted effort to reduce their emission could preserve Arctic ice , while also having major benefit for human health , agricultural productivity and the global environment .

aVThis paper synthesizes and review literature concerning climate change effect on Mediterranean forest ecology and management a well a the restorative technique necessary to maintain forest health , forest yield and biodiversity . Climate change compounded with trend of rural abandonment are likely to diminish forested area within the Mediterranean basin that will be replaced by fire prone shrub community . This could be favoured by outbreak of pathogen , fire and other large-scale disturbance . Landscape fragmentation is expected to impede specie migration . Annual increment and subsequent income from forest are expected to decrease . Reafforestations are necessary to ensure the presence of propagules of forest specie and their site-specific variety best adapted to future climatic condition even though they may be different from the present forest-plant community . Current challenge in biodiversity conservation can only be met by afforestation whose main objective is to maintain ecosystem functioning . A new silviculture must emerge encompassing these habitat displacement and economic concern while maximizing carbon sequestration .

aVThe Yarlung Zangbo River ( YR ) is the highest great river in the world , and it basin is one of the center of human economic activity in Tibet . Using 10 meteorological station over the YR basin in 1961-2005 , the spatial and temporal characteristic of temperature and precipitation a well a potential evapotranspiration are analyzed . The result are a follows . ( 1 ) The annual and four seasonal mean air temperature show statistically significant increasing trend , the tendency is more significant in winter and fall . The warming in Lhasa river basin is most significant . ( 2 ) The precipitation is decreasing from the 1960s to the 1980s and increasing since the 1980s . From 1961 to 2005 , the annual and four seasonal mean precipitation is increasing but not statistically significant , especially in fall and spring . The increasing precipitation rate are more pronounced in Niyangqu and Palong Zangbo river basin , the closer to the upper YR is , the le precipitation increasing rate would be . ( 3 ) The annual and four seasonal mean potential evapotranspiration ha decreased , especially after the 1980s , and most of it happens in winter and spring . The decreasing trend is most significant in the middle YR and Nianchu river basin . ( 4 ) Compared with the Mt . Qomolangma region , Tibetan Plateau , China and global average , the magnitude of warming trend over the YR basin since the 1970s exceed those area in the same period , and compared with the Tibetan Plateau , the magnitude of precipitation increasing and potential evapotranspiration decreasing are larger , suggesting that the YR basin is one of the most sensitive area to global warming .

aVWe have used the Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamique General Circulation Model ( LMD GCM ) to estimate the contribution of different region to global black carbon ( BC ) atmospheric burden and direct radiative forcing ( DRF ) . On the global scale , fossil fuel and biofuels account for 66 % and 34 % of energy-related BC emission , respectively . East and South Asia together contribute more than 50 % of the global surface , atmospheric , and top-of-atmosphere DRF by BC . The regional contribution to global mean forcings closely follow the respective contribution to atmospheric burden . The global warming potential ( GWP ) of BC for different region range from 374 to 677 with a global mean of 480 . Europe is the largest contributor ( 63 % ) to BC deposition at high latitude . The indirect GWP due to the BC effect on snow albedo is estimated to be largest for Europe ( possibly a large a 1200 ) , suggesting that BC emission reduction from this region are more efficient to mitigate climate change .

aVThis paper demonstrates that we widely prophesied doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide level from natural , pre-industral value will enhance the so-called 'greenhouse effect ' but will almost to le than 1 degree C of global warming . It also point out that such a scenario is unlikely to arise given our limited reserve of fossil fuels-certainly not before the end of this century . Furthermore , the paper argues that general circulation model are a yet insufficiently accurate for civil engineer to rely on their prediction in any forward-planning decisions-the omission of solar wind effect being a potentially significant shortcoming . It concludes that the only certainty is that the world 's fossil fuel resource are finite and should be used prudently and with proper respect to the environment .

aVGlobal warming due to increased greenhouse gas is believed to result in not only higher surface temperature but also an acceleration of the hydrological cycle leading to increased precipitation . Although climate model consistently predict increase in global temperature due to increasing greenhouse gas and the accompanying global warming , observation at the climatic timescales necessary to confirm the model are rare . Multidecadal study at global and regional scale are necessary to determine whether the presently observed change in temperature and precipitation are due to short-term fluctuation or long-term trend . In this study , we address this issue by examining change in temperature and precipitation on Long Island , New York over a 74-year time period ( 1931 to 2004 ) using a network of rain gauge and temperature measurement . The mean annual temperature on Long Island ha increased at a rate of 0.05 degree C per decade , which is le than that of observed global value and is most likely due to the urban warming effect of New York City , not large-scale climate change . The mean total annual precipitation ha increased at a rate of 0.71 cm per decade during the study period , which is consistent with global observation . Intra-annual temperature fluctuation are decreasing at a rate of 0.36 % per decade , while precipitation variation are increasing at a rate of 0 . 91 % per decade . Empirical orthogonal function analysis indicates that variation in temperature and precipitation on Long Island are dominated by island-wide fluctuation that are directly related to the North Atlantic Oscillation , the Arctic Oscillation , and the El Nino Southern Oscillation .

aVWe explore the daily evolution of tropical intraseasonal oscillation in satellite-observed tropospheric temperature , precipitation , radiative flux , and cloud property . The warm/rainy phase of a composited average of fifteen oscillation is accompanied by a net reduction in radiative input into the ocean-atmosphere system , with longwave heating anomaly transitioning to longwave cooling during the rainy phase . The increase in longwave cooling is traced to decreasing coverage by ice cloud , potentially supporting Lindzen 's '' infrared iris '' hypothesis of climate stabilization . These observation should be considered in the testing of cloud parameterizations in climate model , which remain source of substantial uncertainty in global warming prediction .

aV[ 1 ] Cloud water can be a significant hydrologic input to mountain forest . Because it is a precipitation source that is vulnerable to climate change , it is important to quantify amount of cloud water input at watershed and regional scale . During this study , cloud water and rain sample were collected monthly for 2 year at site on windward and leeward East Maui . The difference in isotopic composition between volume-weighted average cloud water and rain sample wa 1.4 % delta ( 18 ) O and 12 % delta ( 2 ) H for the windward site and 2.8 % delta ( 18 ) O and 25 % delta ( 2 ) H for the leeward site , with the cloud water sample enriched in ( 18 ) O and ( 2 ) H relative to the rain sample . A summary of previous literature show that fog and/or cloud water is enriched in ( 18 ) O and ( 2 ) H compared to rain at many location around the world ; this study document cloud water and rain isotopic composition resulting from weather pattern common to montane environment in the trade wind latitude . An end-member isotopic composition for cloud water wa identified for each site and wa used in an isotopic mixing model to estimate the proportion of precipitation input from orographic cloud . Orographic cloud water input wa 37 % of the total precipitation at the windward site and 46 % at the leeward site . This represents an estimate of water input to the forest that could be altered by change in cloud base altitude resulting from global climate change or deforestation .

aVSubsurface temperature profile measured in boreholes can be analyzed to infer depth of thermal disturbance and associated surface warming due to combined global warming and urbanization ( heat island effect ) . Asian city are extremely vulnerable because of rapid increase in population . Average subsurface temperature profile in four Asian city ( Tokyo , Osaka , Seoul , and Bangkok ) were compared and analyzed to evaluate the effect of surface warming . The magnitude of surface warming is largest in Tokyo ( 2.8 degree C ) , followed by Seoul ( 2.5 degree C ) , Osaka ( 2.2 degree C ) , and Bangkok ( 1.8 degree C ) . Comparisons between analytical solution and observation show that the mean depth of deviation from the regional geothermal gradient in each urban area may be one of the indicator of the history of urbanization in each city . The mean depth of deviation from the steady thermal gradient , which is approximately 140 m in Tokyo , 80 m in Osaka , and 50 m in Seoul and Bangkok , indicates the time from the start of the additional heat from urbanization . These result agree qualitatively with air temperature record in the city during the last 100 yr . The heat island effect on subsurface temperature is an important global groundwater quality issue because it may alter the groundwater system chemically and microbiologically . Measurement of subsurface temperature data provides important information for understanding the joint effect of urbanization and global warming on groundwater system .

aVReplacing fossil fuel by renewable source of energy is one approach to address the problem of global warming due to anthropogenic emission of greenhouse gas . Wood combustion can help to replace fuel oil or gas . It is advisable , however , to use modern technology for combustion and exhaust gas after-treatment in order to achieve best efficiency and avoid air quality problem due to high emission level often related to small scale wood combustion . In this study , simultaneous combustion particle deposition and heat recovery from the exhaust of two commercially available wood-fired appliance ha been investigated . The experiment were performed with a miniature pipe bundle heat exchanger operating in the exhaust gas line of a fully automated pellet burner or a closed fireplace . The system ha been characterised for a wide range of aerosol inlet temperature ( 135-295 degree C ) and flow velocity ( 0.13-1.0ms ( -1 ) ) , and particle deposition efficiency up to 95 % have been achieved . Deposition wa dominated by thermophoresis and diffusion and increased with the average temperature difference and retention time in the heat exchanger . The aerosol from the two different appliance exhibited different deposition characteristic , which can be attributed to enhanced deposition of the nucleation mode particle generated in the closed fire place . The measured deposition efficiency can be described by simple linear parameterisations derived from laboratory study . The result of this study demonstrate the feasibility of thermophoretic particle removal from biomass burning flue gas and support the development of modified heat exchanger system with enhanced capability for simultaneous heat recovery and particle deposition .

aVOur failure to understand or predict evolutionary dynamic under climatic change precludes much conservation planning . Evolution may reduce extinction under global warming , but few study have explored how genetic covariation , the norm for most quantitative trait , will affect the course of evolution under rapid climatic change . To draw attention to and begin to fill this gap , we draw from the population genetics literature and explore climate-driven evolution using a multi-trait model under two qualitative scenario of climate change . Under a monotonic change in the mean environment and a change in the amplitude and frequency of a periodic environment , we show that the angle between the direction of the largest genetic covariation and the selection gradient is important in determining a population 's fitness decline , or lag load . When the environment change monotonically in the direction of the greatest covariation , the population is able to more closely track the changing environment resulting in a lower lag load . in contrast , when the environment change in a direction of low covariation , the ability of the population to track the changing environment is lower , and the population experience a higher lag load . In a periodic environment , population suffer a higher lag load under increased environmental amplitude than under increased frequency . These observation suggest that population where the angle between the largest genetic covariation and the selection gradient is large , a well a population experiencing an increased magnitude of environmental extreme , may be vulnerable to extinction and genetic bottleneck and may benefit from conservation effort that enhance the preservation of genetic diversity . To make specific prediction of evolutionary trajectory and obtain estimate of lag load for natural population , climatic change have to be quantified in term of fitness landscape and genetic covariation among climate-related trait must be measured . We performed an extensive review of the literature and found only 24 study that quantify covariation in trait involving climate . ( C ) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVGoal , Scope and Background . Enzymes are biological catalyst with an enormous capacity to increase the speed of a huge variety biochemical reaction . Industrially produced enzyme are used in a broad variety of sector to increase quality , speed and yield of process , and reduce energy consumption and use of hazardous chemical . The present paper provides a methodological framework for analysing environmental impact of enzyme product and environmental data for five characteristic enzyme product . Methods . Life cycle assessment is used a an analytical tool and modelling of enzyme production is facilitated in SimaPro 6.0 software . Detailed data on enzyme production are derived from Novozymes ' production facility in Denmark . Data on ingredient are derived from the literature , publicly available database and from Novozymes ' supplier . Results and Conclusions . Cradle-to-gate environmental data for five representative enzyme product produced by Novozymes in Denmark have been determined , and a basis for further assessment of more of Novozymes ' enzyme product ha been established . Environmental impact induced by producing the considered enzyme product vary by a factor 10 or more depending on the impact category considered . Contributions to global warming range , for example , between one and ten kg CO2-equivalents per kg final product . The variation is explained by difference in fermentation time , formulation type , production yield and strength of the final product . The main source of environmental impact are usually fermentation process due to electricity and ingredient consumption . Enzyme production ha been the subject of significant optimisation during the past decade by implementation of e.g . gene modified production strain , and the provided environmental data are only representative to enzyme product produced by Novozymes at the present optimisation stage . Recommendations and Perspectives . Novozymes produce more than 600 enzyme product for use in a variety of sector , and the established framework for environmental assessment will be used for assessing more product in order to provide a broad basis for environmental comparison of enzyme assisted technology and conventional technology .

aVThis paper present the new ternary non-azeotropic mixture of R32/R125/R161 a an alternative refrigerant to R407C . The physical property of the ternary mixture are similar to those of R407C , and it is environmental friendly , that is , it ha zero ozone-depletion potential ( ODP ) and lower global warming potential ( GWP ) than R407C . Theoretical cycle performance of R32/R125/R161 and R407C are calculated and analyzed firstly . Based on the theoretical study , experimental test are performed on a vapor-compression refrigeration system with a rotor compressor which wa originally designed for R407C ( without any modification to system component for R407C ) . Experimental result under different working condition indicate that the pressure ratio and power consumption of the new refrigerant are lower than those of R407C , and it refrigerating capacity and coefficient of performance ( COP ) are superior to those of R407C , respectively , and it discharge temperature is slightly higher than that of R407C . Therefore , the new refrigerant R32/R125/R161 could be considered a a promising refrigerant to R407C . ( c ) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVIn order to detect the effect of climate change on Erman 's birch ( Betula ermanii Charm . ) , we examined radial growth-climate relationship of Erman 's birch forest at their upper limit of distribution in Changbai Mountain , Northeast China . Thirty Erman 's birch tree from six stand were sampled at an elevation of about 1950 m a.s.l . Correlation and response function coefficient indicated that radial growth of Erman 's birch wa positively influenced by previous August , October and current February temperature , and previous winter , and current March , June and September precipitation . In addition , radial growth showed a negative relationship to previous August and current June sunshine ratio . Precipitation and temperature in annualization period also positively affected the radial growth of Erman 's birch . Regression analysis indicated that precipitation explained more variation in radial growth than minimum temperature . Together , these result suggested that climate affected radial growth of Erman 's birch through altering soil water availability . Therefore , the radial growth of Erman 's birch at the tree line in Changbai Mountain could not be predicted by temperature alone even under a scenario of global warming . ( c ) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

aVPioneering work in the last century ha resulted in a widely accepted paradigm that primary production is strongly positively related to temperature and water availability such that the northern hemispheric forest carbon sink may increase under condition of global warming . However , the terrestrial carbon sink at the ecosystem level ( i.e . net ecosystem productivity , NEP ) depends on the net balance between gross primary productivity ( GPP ) and ecosystem respiration ( TER ) . Through an analysis of European eddy covariance flux data set , we find that the common climate relationship for primary production do not hold for NEP . This is explained by the fact that decrease in GPP are largely compensated by parallel decrease in TER when climatic factor become more limiting . Moreover , we found overall that water availability wa a significant modulator of NEP , while the multivariate effect of mean annual temperature is small and not significant . These result indicate that climate- and particularly temperature-based projection of net carbon balance may be misleading . Future research should focus on interaction between the water and carbon cycle and the effect of disturbance on the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystem .

aVCoral reef are expected to be severely impacted by rising seawater temperature associated with climate change . The fertilization and early embryogenesis of four reef-building coral specie representing three Indo-Pacific family were examined in a series of laboratory experiment where temperature were increased up to 5-6 degree C at ambient . High level of fertilization and normal ernbryogenesis were observed for Favites abdita . Favites chinensis and Mycedium elephantotus at temperature to 32 degree C ( +5 degree C ) and embryo developed normally until the 5th cell cleavage . Acropora millepora wa the only specie to be affected by higher temperature , exhibiting significantly reduced fertilization and a higher frequency of embryonic abnormality at 32 degree C ( +4 degree C ) , and fertilization ceased altogether at 34 degree C ( +6 degree C ) . Early cell cleavage rate increased with temperature up to 32 degree C for all specie .

aVThis paper examines several prominent thermodynamic and dynamic factor responsible for the meridional and vertical warming asymmetry using a moist coupled atmosphere-surface radiative transportive four-box climate model . A coupled atmosphere-surface feedback analysis is formulated to isolate the direct response to an anthropogenic greenhouse gas forcing from individual local feedback ( water vapor , evaporation , surface sensible heat flux , and ice-albedo ) , and from the non-local dynamical feedback . Both the direct response and response to water vapor feedback are stronger in low latitude . The joint effect of the ice-albedo and dynamical greenhouse-plus feedback act to amplify the high latitude surface warming whereas both the evaporation and dynamical greenhouse-minus feedback cause a reduction of the surface warming in low latitude . The enhancement ( reduction ) of local feedback in high ( low ) latitude in response to the non-local dynamic feedback further strengthens the polar amplification of the surface warming . Both the direct response and response to water vapor feedback lead to an increase of lapse rate in both low and high latitude . The stronger total dynamic heating in the mean state in high latitude is responsible for a larger increase of lapse rate in high latitude in the direct response and response to water vapor feedback . The local evaporation and surface sensible heat flux feedback reduce the lapse rate both in low and high latitude through cooling the surface and warming the atmosphere . The much stronger evaporation feedback lead to a final warming in low latitude that is stronger in the atmosphere than the surface .

aVWe developed a 3D ecosystem-biogeochemical model based on NEMURO ( North Pacific Ecosystem Model Used for Regional Oceanography ) and applied it to the western North Pacific in order to predict the effect of global warming on ecosystem dynamic and biogeochemical cycle . Using datasets of observed climatology and simulated field according to a global warming scenario , IS92a ( CO-AGCM developed by CCSR/NIES ) a boundary condition for our ecosystem model , we conducted present-day and global warming experiment and compared their result . Model result in the global warming experiment show increase in vertical stratification due to rising temperature . As a result , the predicted nutrient and chlorophyll-a concentration in the surface water decrease at the end of the 21st century and the dominant phytoplankton group shift from diatom to other small phytoplankton . The P/B ratio slightly increase from that in the present a a result of favorable temperature condition , although nutrient condition become worse . The increase in the P/B ratio cause increase in the NPP and GPP , although new and export production decrease . Increases in the regeneration rate ( i.e. , decrease in the e-ratio ) also contribute to increase in NPP and GPP through nutrient supply within the surface water . Changes in seasonal variation of biomass and the dominant phytoplankton group in the subarctic-subtropical transition region associated with the global warming are large in all region . in the global warming scenario , the onset of the diatom spring bloom is predicted to take place 1.5 month earlier than in the present-day simulation due to strengthened stratification . The maximum biomass in the spring bloom is predicted to decrease drastically compared to the present due to the decrease in nutrient concentration . In contrast , the biomass maximum of the other small phytoplankton at the end of the diatom spring bloom is the same a the present , because they can adapt to the low nutrient condition due to their small half-saturation constant . Therefore , a change in the dominant phytoplankton group appears notably at the end of spring bloom . Since the present nutrient concentration and phytoplankton biomass from summer to winter are low compared with those in spring , these change associated with the global warming are small . That is , it is interesting that the change do not occur uniformly in all season , but occur dramatically at the end of the spring and in the fall bloom . ( c ) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

aVThere ha been a growing concern on the emission of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere , whose consequence is global warming . The source of greenhouse gas have been identified , of which the major contributor is the combustion of fossil fuel . Researchers have intensified effort towards identifying greener alternative fuel substitute for the present fossil fuel . Natural gas is now being investigated a potential alternative fuel for diesel engine . Natural gas appears more attractive due to it high octane number and perhaps , due to it environmental friendly nature . The test result showed that alternative fuel exhibit longer ignition delay , with slow burning rate . Longer delay will lead to unacceptable rate of pressure rise with the result of diesel knock . This work examines the effect of advanced injection timing on the emission characteristic of dual-fuel engine . The engine ha standard injection timing of 30 degree BTDC . The injection wa first advanced by 5.5 degree and given injection timing of 35.5 degree BTDC . The engine performance wa erratic on this timing . The injection wa then advanced by 3.5 degree . The engine performance wa smooth on this timing especially at low loading condition . The ignition delay wa reduced through advanced injection timing but tended to incur a slight increase in fuel consumption . The CO and CO2 emission were reduced through advanced injection timing .

aVThe concern regarding global warming and need for new energy resource brought the concept of biomass and waste a secondary fuel to the power industry . Mercury emission in case of cofiring of chicken manure , olive residue , and B-wood with a high volatile bituminous coal blend are studied in the first part of this paper . The use of secondary fuel significantly affect NOx emission due to different type of nitrogen present in the fuel matrix . Air-staging is a proven in-furnace NOx reduction technology . The present work mainly involves bench scale study to investigate the effect of air-staging on partitioning of mercury in pulverized fuel co-combustion . The combustion experiment are carried out in an entrained flow reactor at 1300 degree C with a 20 % ( th ) share of secondary fuel . Elemental and total gaseous mercury from the reactor is measured on-line , and ash is analyzed for particulate mercury along with elemental and surface property . Reducing the air stoichiometry in the primary zone of the combustor increase unburnt carbon which in turn reduces mercury emission in the gas phase . Ash analysis show the effect of surface area , particle size , and unburnt carbon on mercury capture . Calcium variation in the ash wa observed due to formation of different slag in reducing and oxidizing condition and might have affected the mercury capture in combination with the above parameter . A low iron concentration of ash doe not seem to affect the capture of mercury . The result will help in predicting different form of mercury emitted from the furnace at desired operating condition which will eventually form the basis for the design of the control strategy for mercury emission .

aVImpacts of nutrient management on C mineralization and greenhouse gas ( GHGs ) emission from soil have been of much concern in global change . Using laboratory incubation , the production of CH4 and CO2 were studied from both bulk sample and the particle size fraction ( PSF ) of topsoil from a paddy under a long-term different fertilization trial ( including non ( NF ) , chemical without ( CF ) and with manure ( CFM ) fertilization , respectively ) in the Tai Lake Region , China . Four PSFs ( 2000-200 , 200-20 , 20-2 , < 2 mu m ) were separated from undisturbed sample collected after rice harvest by a low-energy ultrasonic dispersion procedure . Both the bulk sample and PSFs were incubated under submerged condition for 72 day . The concentration of CH4 and CO2 evolved during incubation were determined by gas chromatography . C mineralization rate ranged from 0.13 to 0.52 mg C g ( -1 ) C day ( -1 ) , with different fertilization and size of the PSFs , and were not correlated with C/N ratio . While CO2 , production predominated over CH4 from C mineralization from both bulk sample and the size fraction , CH4 production played a predominant role in the total global warming potential ( GWP ) under all treatment . C mineralization of bulk soil wa significantly higher under CF than under CFM and NF . CH4 production , however , wa 3 time a under CFM and 27 time a under NF , indicating a tremendous effect of chemical fertilization alone on the total GWR CO2 production from the PSFs differed from CH4 under a single treatment , which wa notably from the coarse PSFs larger than 200 mu m. Higher C mineralization and CH4 production with a higher metabolic quotient under CF implicated a vulnerability of soil functioning of GHGs mitigation in the paddy receiving chemical fertilizer only . Thus , rational organic amendment should be undertaken for mitigating the climate change . ( c ) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V .

aVThe response of tropical cyclone activity to global warming is widely debated ( 1-10 ) . It is often assumed that warmer sea surface temperature provide a more favourable environment for the development and intensification of tropical cyclone , but cyclone genesis and intensity are also affected by the vertical thermodynamic property of the atmosphere ( 1,10-13 ) . Here we use climate model and observational reconstruction to explore the relationship between change in sea surface temperature and tropical cyclone 'potential intensity ' - a measure that provides an upper bound on cyclone intensity ( 10-14 ) and can also reflect the likelihood of cyclone development ( 15,16 ) . We find that change in local sea surface temperature are inadequate for characterizing even the sign of change in potential intensity , but that long- term change in potential intensity are closely related to the regional structure of warming ; region that warm more than the tropical average are characterized by increased potential intensity , and vice versa . We use this relationship to reconstruct change in potential intensity over the twentieth century from observational reconstruction of sea surface temperature . We find that , even though tropical Atlantic sea surface temperature are currently at a historical high , Atlantic potential intensity probably peaked in the 1930s and 1950s , and recent value are near the historical average . Our result indicate that - per unit local sea surface temperature change - the response of tropical cyclone activity to natural climate variation , which tend to involve localized change in sea surface temperature , may be larger than the response to the more uniform pattern of greenhouse- gas- induced warming .

aVAim Evolutionary theory predicts that level of genetic variation in island population will be positively correlated with island area and negatively correlated with island isolation . These pattern have been empirically established for oceanic island , but little is known about the determinant of variation on habitat island . The goal of this study were twofold . Our first aim wa to test whether published pattern of genetic variation in mammal occurring on montane habitat island in the American Southwest conformed to expectation based on evolutionary theory . The second aim of this research wa to develop simple heuristic model to predict change in genetic variation that may occur in these population a a result of reduction in available mountaintop habitat in response to global warming . Location Habitat island of conifer forest on mountaintops in the American Southwest . Methods Relationships between island area and isolation with measure of allozyme variation in four specie of small mammal , namely the least chipmunk ( Tamias minimus ) , Colorado chipmunk ( Tamias quadrivittatus ) , red squirrel ( Tamiasciurus hudsonicus ) , and Mexican woodrat ( Neotoma mexicana ) , were determined using correlation and regression technique . Significant relationship between island area and genetic variation were used to develop three distinct statistical model with which to predict change in genetic variation following reduction in insular habitat area arising from global warming . Results Patterns of genetic variation in each specie conformed to evolutionary prediction . In general , island area wa the most important determinant of heterozygosity , while island isolation wa the most important determinant of polymorphism and allelic diversity . The heuristic model predicted widespread reduction in genetic variation , the extent of which depended on the population and model considered . Main conclusion The result support a generalized pattern of genetic variation for any specie with an insular distribution , with reduced variation in smaller , more isolated population . We predict widespread reduction in genetic variation in isolated population of montane small mammal in the American Southwest a a result of global warming . We conclude that climate-induced reduction in the various dimension of genetic variation may increase the probability of population extinction in both the short and long term .

aVThe effect of high temperature on the lichen Evernia prunastri wa investigated by analysing the content of photosynthetic pigment , chlorophyll degradation , and the integrity of cell membrane . Results indicate that E. prunastri can tolerate a temperature of 40 degree C for 24 h , but for longer period a reduction in chlorophyll b is apparent , suggesting that chlorophyll b could be used a a valuable parameter to detect change caused by prolonged exposure to such temperature . Exposure of E. prunastri to a temperature of 80 degree C had strongly negative effect on the content of photosynthetic pigment , causing both inhibition of chlorophyll synthesis and chlorophyll degradation to phaeophytin ; slow acclimation wa not capable of preventing such damage . Damage to cell membrane , a indicated by change in electrical conductivity of the medium , proved to be a useful and simple tool for measuring damage caused by high temperature . Besides the effect of temperature , result also indicate that exposure to a prolonged dark period ha an important negative influence on the chlorophyll alb ratio , suggesting that lichen could be profitably used not only to monitor climate change , but also to monitor the effect of global dimming .

aVThe Skjonhaug constructed wetland ( CW ) is a free surface water ( FSW ) wetland polishing chemically treated municipal wastewater in southeastern Norway and consists of three pond a well a trickling , unsaturated filter with light weight aggregate ( LWA ) . Fluxes of nitrous oxide ( N ( 2 ) O ) and methane ( CH ( 4 ) ) have been measured during the autumn , winter and summer from all three pond a well a from the unsaturated filter . Physicochemical parameter of the water have been measured at the same locality . The large temporal and spatial variation of N ( 2 ) O flux wa found to cover a range of - 0.49 to 110 mg N ( 2 ) O-N m ( -2 ) day ( -1 ) , while the flux of CH ( 4 ) wa found to cover a range of -1.2 to 1900 mg m ( -2 ) day ( -1 ) . Thus , both emission and consumption occurred . Regarding flux of N ( 2 ) O there wa a significant difference between the summer , winter and autumn , with the highest emission occurring during the autumn . The flux of CH ( 4 ) were , on the other hand , not significantly different with regard to season . Both the emission of N ( 2 ) O and CH ( 4 ) were positively influenced by the amount of total organic carbon ( TOC ) . The measured flux of N ( 2 ) O and CH ( 4 ) are in the same range a those reported from other CWs treating wastewater .

aVThe start of the Palaeocene/Eocene thermal maximum - a period of exceptional global warming about 55 million year ago - is marked by a prominent negative carbon isotope excursion that reflects a massive input of C-13-depleted ( `light ' ) carbon to the ocean - atmosphere system ( 1 ) . It is often assumed ( 2 ) that this carbon injection initiated the rapid increase in global surface temperature and environmental change that characterize the climate perturbation ( 3-7 ) , but the exact sequence of event remains uncertain . Here we present chemical and biotic record of environmental change across the Palaeocene/Eocene boundary from two sediment section in New Jersey that have high sediment accumulation rate . We show that the onset of environmental change ( a recorded by the abundant occurrence ( 'acme ' ) of the dinoflagellate cyst Apectodinium ) and of surface- ocean warming ( a evidenced by the palaeothermometer TEX86 ) preceded the light carbon injection by several thousand year . The onset of the Apectodinium acme also precedes the carbon isotope excursion in section from the southwest Pacific Ocean ( 8 ) and the North Sea , indicating that the early onset of environmental change wa not confined to the New Jersey shelf . The lag of similar to 3,000 year between the onset of warming in New Jersey shelf water and the carbon isotope excursion is consistent with the hypothesis that bottom water warming caused the injection of C-13-depleted carbon by triggering the dissociation of submarine methane hydrate ( 1,9,10 ) , but the cause of the early warming remains uncertain .

aVBitter crab disease ( BCD ) is caused by Hematodinium sp. , an endoparasitic dinoflagellate . It life within the hemocoeloms of snow crab Chionoecetes opilio and Tanner crab C. bairdi , making them unmarketable due to their bitter flavor . Two recent outbreak of BCD have occurred in Conception Bay , Newfoundland , one from 1999 to 2000 and another from 2003 to 2005 . In the earlier outbreak , prevalence wa highest in juvenile and primiparous female and juvenile male . It wa thought to be highest in these host because they molt more frequently than larger male and the disease is transmitted to newly molted crab . In the 2003 to 2005 outbreak , the prevalence of BCD changed and wa at it highest , 24 % in trapped male and 13.5 % in trawled male . This apparent shift in the dynamic of the infection between the earlier 1999 to 2000 and later 2003 to 2005 outbreak wa highly correlated with 2 factor : an increase in bottom temperature , associated with the recent climatic warming trend in the Northwest Atlantic , and an increase in molting activity of the snow crab due presumably to the temperature increase within Conception Bay . That is , rising temperature occurring from 2003 to 2005 likely stimulated molting activity in snow crab , which led to an increase in susceptible host in the population . Given the positive correlation between increased bottom temperature , increased molting activity , and the latest outbreak of BCD , we predict that further trend in climatic warming will enhance transmission , spreading the parasite into additional fishing area .

aVWMO-recommended 30-yr normal are no longer generally useful for the design , planning , and decision-making purpose for which they were intended . They not only have little relevance to the future climate , but are often unrepresentative of the current climate . The reason for this is rapid global climate change over the last 30 yr that is likely to continue into the future . It is demonstrated that simple empirical alternative already are available that not only produce reasonably accurate normal for the current climate but also often justify their extrapolation to several year into the future . This result is tied to the condition that recent trend in the climate are approximately linear or have a substantial linear component . This condition is generally satisfied for the U. S. climate-division data . One alternative [ the optimal climate normal ( OCN ) ] is multiyear average that are not fixed at 30 yr like WMO normal are but rather are adapted climate record by climate record based on easily estimated characteristic of the record . The OCN work well except with very strong trend or longer extrapolation with more moderate trend . In these case least square linear trend fit to the period since the mid-1970s are viable alternative . An even better alternative is the use of `` hinge fit '' normal , based on modeling the time dependence of large-scale climate change . Here , longer record can be exploited to stabilize estimate of modern trend . Related issue are the need to avoid arbitrary trend fitting and to account for trend in study of ENSO impact . Given these result , the author recommend that ( a ) the WMO and national climate service address new policy for changing climate normal using the result here a a starting point and ( b ) NOAA initiate a program for improved estimate and forecast of official U. S. normal , including operational implementation of a simple hybrid system that combine the advantage of both the OCN and the hinge fit .

aVSoil moisture trend , particularly during the growing season , are an important possible consequence of global warming . Climate model simulation of future soil moisture change should be made with model that can produce reliable simulation of soil moisture for past climate change . In this paper , we compare soil moisture simulation from Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment climate model forced with observed climate forcings for the past century , and evaluate them using in situ soil moisture measurement from over 140 station or district in midlatitudes of the Northern Hemisphere . To account for the observed spatial scale of soil moisture variation , we used regionally averaged soil moisture for six region . The model showed realistic seasonal cycle for Ukraine , Russia , and Illinois , but generally poor seasonal cycle for Mongolia and China . To explore the summer drying issue for the second half of the 20th century , we analyzed the linear trend of soil moisture for Ukraine and Russia . Observations from both region show increase in summer for the period from 1958-1999 that were larger than most trend in the model simulation . Only two out of 25 model realization show trend comparable to those of observation . These two trend , however , are due to internal model variability rather than a result of external forcing . Changes in precipitation and temperature can not fully explain soil moisture increase for Ukraine and Russia , which indicates that other factor might have played a dominant role on the observed pattern for soil moisture . We suggest that change in solar irradiance ( the dimming effect ) and resultant change in evaporative demand explain most of the observed soil moisture trend . To understand such sensitivity , we analyzed soil moisture output in a special version of the ECHAM5 model that wa capable of capturing the observed radiation pattern a a result of incorporating a sophisticated aerosol scheme . Results suggest that both radiation and precipitation pattern are required to be adequately simulated to reproduce the observed soil moisture trend realistically .

aVMethane is a powerful greenhouse gas and may have played a significant role in global climate change in the geological past . Destabilization of gas hydrate , frozen methane stored within the ocean floor sediment and in permafrost , may have provided an important source of methane to the atmosphere . Ocean Drilling Program Hole 997A ( water depth 2770 m ) , situated on the crest of the Blake Outer Ridge , is a potentially large reservoir of gas hydrate . Methane emission from the Blake Outer Ridge have been reported previously , which ha been suggested a a driver for global climate change . Methane at this site is of biogenic origin , produced by the bacterial decomposition of organic matter . We used benthic foraminifer faunal assemblage ( > 125 mu m size fraction ) and specie diversity , combined with total organic carbon data from Hole 997A , to identify interval of methane release during the late Neogene ( last 5.4 Ma ) . We identified a group of benthic foraminifera , which were taken to indicate methane flux based on previous work on seep-related benthic foraminifera . We then classified 'seep-related ' benthic foraminifera , a well a high organic carbon taxon independent of deep-sea oxygenation . We recognized five interval of increased abundance of the seep-related benthic foraminifera since last 3.6 Ma representing interval of methane release , which coincide with interval of lowered sea level . Changes in benthic foraminifera are more abrupt over the past 3.6 Ma when the northern hemisphere glaciation began to intensify and climate switched to a 41-kyr cycle world .

aVAn integrated view on the possible effect of global climate change is provided while taking into account that not only the rising average temperature is likely to impact natural population but also that increased variation around the mean and higher frequency of extreme event will be important . We propose that complex genetic effect in concert with demographic pattern may affect how focal population react to the environmental challenge in an adaptive way ( if they can ) . In order to aim for an inclusive picture of the ongoing environmental change we argue for a synthesis of knowledge from a range of 'classical ' discipline such a quantitative genetics , conservation genetics and population ecology . A hereto little exposed concern is the importance of the increase in amplitude of environmental fluctuation and how the corresponding evolutionary and ecological reaction are expected to occur . Due to the complex interaction between the ecological and genetic mechanism in the response to climate-induced impact interdisciplinary approach are the most promising path in seeking knowledge about the present and future change in the biosphere .

aVPaleoclimatic record from the climatically sensitive Canadian prairie are relatively rare due to the scarcity of study site with continuous Holocene stratigraphic sequence . Oro Lake , a meromictic lake in the dry grassland of Saskatchewan ( Canada ) , contains a continuous Holocene diatom record spanning the last similar to 10,000 year . Here we present analysis at three different time scale and resolution : ( 1 ) 1-3 yr resolution of the past similar to 80 year , ( 2 ) century-scale analysis of the Holocene , and ( 3 ) decadal-scale analysis of the past similar to 7000 year . Recent change in the diatom assemblage and their respective salinity inference were significantly related to measured effective moisture ( precipitation minus evaporation , P-ET ) . The drought of the 1930s , and a wet period during the 1950s are clearly evident in the diatom record , suggesting the Oro Lake record contains a sensitive archive of past climatic condition . Century-scale analysis of the diatom record during the Holocene is consistent with a cool and moist climate in the early Holocene ( prior to ca 9700cal yr BP , 8600 C-14 yr BP ) . An abrupt increase in diatom-inferred salinity at 9600 cal yr BP ( 8500 C-14 yr BP ) indicates the onset of an and climate , with continuing and condition throughout the mid-Holocene . Decadal-scale analysis of the past similar to 7000 year suggests that the mid-Holocene wa more complex , with extended period of increased variability in precipitation , particularly between ca 5800-3600 cal yr BP ( 5000-3200 C-14 yr BP ) which is characterized by interval of increased effective moisture . The past similar to 2000 year is characterized by reduced salinity and generally wetter condition in comparison to the mid-Holocene . The combination of the different scale of analysis in this study provides a detailed account of the dynamic nature of climate from sub-decadal to millennial scale in the Oro Lake region within the Palliser Triangle . Climate model prediction suggest that the Canadian prairie region may see a higher frequency of extreme drought under projected global warming , potentially similar to the most and period seen during the mid-Holocene when many lake basin completely dried out .

aVA consistent weakening and poleward expansion of the Hadley circulation is diagnosed in the climate change simulation of the IPCC AR4 project . Associated with this widening is a poleward expansion of the subtropical dry zone . Simple scaling analysis support the notion that the poleward extent of the Hadley cell is set by the location where the thermally driven jet first becomes baroclinically unstable . The expansion of the Hadley cell is caused by an increase in the subtropical static stability , which push poleward the baroclinic instability zone and hence the outer boundary of the Hadley cell .

Here , the possibility to blend cottonseed oil directly with fossil diesel a a fuel for diesel engine is examined . This option ha lower cost and larger well-to-wheel greenhouse gas benefit than fatty acid methylesters . The paper present measurement of important fuel property , density , viscosity , cetane number and cold flow characteristic . In addition , a common rail Euro 3 compliant diesel car is tested using 10 % v/v cottonseed oil-diesel blend in order to examine the effect on performance and emission of regulated pollutant and CO2 . Furthermore , particle emission characteristic are studied , including total and solid particle number concentration and particle size distribution over driving cycle and steady state mode . The result indicate that the test fuel present good operating characteristic and limited effect on regulated emission and vehicle performance . These result would justify further research on the direct use of vegetable oil a automotive fuel .

aVWe used stochastic dynamic programming to investigate a spectacular migration strategy in the black brant Branta bernicla nigricans , a specie of goose . Black brant migration is well suited for theoretical analysis since there are a number of existing strategy that easily can be compared . In early autumn , almost the entire population of the black brant gather at Izembek Lagoon on the Alaska Peninsula to stage and refuel before the southward migration . There are at least three distinct strategy , with most goose making a spectacular direct migration more than 5000 km across the Gulf of Alaska to their wintering ground in southern Baja California or mainland Mexico . This is a potentially dangerous strategy since foraging is not possible during the overseas passage . Some individual instead use shorter flight to make a detour along the coast , a longer route that all individual use for northward migration in spring . Since flight cost accelerate with increasing body mass , migration by short flight is energetically cheaper than long-distance flight . A small but increasing part of the population ha recently begun to winter at Izembek . We investigated this migration under two different supposition using a dynamic state variable model . First , if the goose are free to make a strategic choice , under what assumption should they prefer direct migration and under what assumption should they prefer detour migration/winter residency ? Second , provided that the dominating direct migration strategy is optimal , what condition will force the goose to go for detour migration/winter residency ? In the second case the goose may try to follow an optimal direct migration strategy , but stochastic event may force them to choose a suboptimal policy . We also simulated possible effect of global warming . The model suggests that the fuel level at arrival in Izembek and fuel gain rate are key factor and that tail wind must have been reliable in the past , otherwise direct migration could not have evolved . It also suggests that a change to milder winter may promote an unexpectedly abrupt change from long-distance to short-distance migration or winter residency . Finally , it produced a number of prediction that might be testable in the field . ( c ) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVCommercial refrigerating system are mostly based on hydrochlorofluorocarbon ( HCFC ) fluid . The Kyoto Protocol requirement encouraged the promotion of policy for sustainable development and reduction of global warming potential , including the regulation of HCFCs . In that sense , R-744 is the only natural refrigerant replacement known to be nontoxic , nonflammable , and not harmful to the environment . The aim of this work is to aid in the development of new reciprocating compressor for light commercial application that use CO2 a the fluid refrigerant . First , a numerical analysis and experimental validation were developed and carried out , not only for laboratory compressor prototype , but also for the whole transcritical CO2 cycle . The numerical comparative result present a reasonably good agreement and successfully allow the use of these numerical tool to improve the successive design . Consequently , several compressor pre-industrial prototype have been designed , validated , and improved . The experimental result against standard compressor show the possibility that CO2 compressor offer in term of efficiency and COP . Finally , an appliance test is presented to check the performance of the overall system and confirm the preliminary result obtained in the calorimeter test . The appliance platform result prove the feasibility of these light commercial application using R-744 a the fluid refrigerant .

aVFlood/drought series during the past 1000 yr in the Yangtze Delta , China , wa reconstructed based on historical document and local chronology . Continuous wavelet transform wa applied to detect the periodicity and variability of the flood/drought series . Research result indicate that : ( 1 ) Larger fluctuation of climatic change in the Tibetan Plateau result in higher wavelet variance of flood/drought in the Yangtze Delta , for example , during 1400-1700 , the proxy indicator indicate that the annual temperature in Tibet experienced larger variability and that this time interval exactly corresponds to the time when the higher and significant wavelet variance occurred ; ( 2 ) Periods featured by colder temperature in the Tibetan Plateau usually correspond to period characterized by higher wetness with higher probability of flood event ; ( 3 ) Variability of heating feature of the Tibetan Plateau exerted great influence on intensity and onset of Indian monsoon and south Asian summer monsoon , and these atmospheric activity are in direct connection with precipitation in Eastern China . Current global warming may alter the snow mass of Tibetan Plateau and then alters the heating feature of Tibetan Plateau , which may in turn impact flood/drought condition in the Yangtze Delta .

aVincreasing evidence suggests that lichen are responding to climate change in Western Europe . More epiphytic specie appear to be increasing , rather than declining , a a result of global warming . Many terricolous specie , in contrast , are declining . Changes to epiphytic flora are markedly more rapid in formerly heavily polluted , generally built-up or open rural area , a compared to forested region . Both the distribution ( southern ) and ecology ( warmth-loving ) of the newly established or increasing specie seem to be determined by global warming . Epiphytic temperate to boreo-montane specie appear to be relatively unaffected . Vacant niche caused by other environmental change are showing the most pronouced effect of global warming . Species most rapidly increasing in forest , although taxonomically unrelated , all contain Trentepohlia a phycobiont in addition to having a southern distribution . This suggests that in this habitat , Trentepohlia algae , rather than the different lichen symbioses , are affected by global warming . ( c ) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVGlobal climate change may have large impact on water supply , drought or flood frequency and magnitude in local and regional hydrologic system . Water authority therefore rely on computer model for quantitative impact prediction . In this study we present kernel-based learning machine river flow model for the Upper Gallego catchment of the Ebro basin . Different learning machine were calibrated using daily gauge data . The model posed two major challenge : ( 1 ) estimation of the rainfall-runoff transfer function from the available time series is complicated by anthropogenic regulation and mountainous terrain and ( 2 ) the river flow model is weak when only climate data are used , but additional antecedent flow data seemed to lead to delayed peak How estimation . These type of model , together with the presented downscaled climate scenario , can be used for climate change impact assessment in the Gallego , which is important for the future management of the system .

aVWe statistically analyzed both the reproducibility of the present climate , and future climate projection in the Asian monsoon region , using two Regional Climate Models ( RCMs ) , nested into the MRI-CGCM2.2 to ass regional climate projection associated with global warming . Both GCM-RCM system reproduced the present regional surface air temperature well . Also , they indicated about the same temperature increase a that of GCM for all region over the Asian continent . The reproducibility of the present-climate precipitation amount , in the lower-latitude region wa not a good a that of the surface air temperature , although it wa better simulated in the higher-latitude region . The future precipitation increase wa not statistically significant . It wa also statistically revealed that precipitation in future projection , with GCM-RCM system , tended to converge in region where the model bias were small . This result suggests the importance of an accurate reproduction of the present regional climate using physically based dynamical model , in order to analyze regional climate change .

aVKnown occurrence based on natural history museum voucher specimen for three genus of African forest squirrel were used to develop a detailed , fine-scale distributional under-standing of each specie . Considerations of specie ' autecology , effect of land use change , and effect of global climate change were all included in our analysis , and negative effect of land use and climate change on specie ' distributional area were roughly equivalent across the specie surveyed . We describe geographic pattern of distribution and endemism , and identify area of potential occurrence of unknown specie . Comparing with coarse grid-based approach currently in vogue in African biodiversity conservation effort , we suggest that the point-based method offer significant advantage in fine resolution and avoiding loss of information , and yet are feasibly implemented for many vertebrate group .

aV[ 1 ] Glaciers in Iceland began retreating around 1890 , and since then the Vatnajokull ice cap ha lost over 400 km 3 of ice . The associated unloading of the crust induces a glacio-isostatic response . From 1996 to 2004 a GPS network wa measured around the southern edge of Vatnajokull . These measurement , together with more extended time series at several other GPS site , indicate vertical velocity around the ice cap ranging from 9 to 25 mm/yr , and horizontal velocity in the range 3 to 4 mm/yr . The vertical velocity have been modeled using the finite element method ( FEM ) in order to constrain the viscosity structure beneath Vatnajokull . We use an axisymmetric Earth model with an elastic plate over a uniform viscoelastic half-space . The observation are consistent with prediction based on an Earth model made up of an elastic plate with a thickness of 10-20 km and an underlying viscosity in the range 4-10 x 10 ( 18 ) Pa s. Knowledge of the Earth structure allows u to predict uplift around Vatnajokull in the next decade . According to our estimate of the rheological parameter , and assuming that ice thinning will continue at a similar rate during this century ( about 4 km 3/year ) , a minimum uplift of 2.5 meter between 2000 to 2100 is expected near the current ice cap edge . If the thinning rate were to double in response to global warming ( about 8 km 3/year ) , then the minimum uplift between 2000 to 2100 near the current ice cap edge is expected to be 3.7 meter .

aVThe knowledge of how and why marine Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio changed help understand the impact of many process on the global biogeochemical cycle in the geological past . Here we examine the possible influence of global cooling on the evolution of marine Sr-87/Sr-86 curve by a kinetic approach . The importance of mica weathering is emphasized due to it high content of radiogenic strontium and low activation energy in weathering reaction . Since the activation energy determines the sensitivity of weathering rate in response to temperature change , global cooling will increase the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio of continental flux by relatively preferential weathering of mica . Based on the average strontium content and Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio of the mica mineral in the exposed upper continental crust , a kinetic model is established to survey the response of riverine Sr-87/Sr-86 to the change of global temperature . The model result indicates that the increase of riverine Sr-87/Sr-86 caused by global cooling can solely account for most of the increase in seawater Sr-87/Sr-86 since 3.4 Myr B.P . This finding emphasizes that the weathering kinetics is an important mechanism relating the global climate change to marine Sr-87/Sr-86 curve ; and the marine Sr-87/Sr-86 curve should be used with great care in the climate-weathering-tectonic connection .

aVPurpose - Using two different conceptual approach to environmental life-cycle assessment , attributional and consequential , the purpose wa to test the hypothesis that a typical lead free solder paste Sn95.5Ag3.8CuO.7 is worse than Sn63Pb37 a far a global environmental impact are concerned . Design/methodology/approach - Single index weighting index within the impact methodology Life cycle Impact Assessment Method based on Endpoint Modelling ( LIME ) impact methodology , were applied to the flow of three life cycle inventory model and their globally related flow . The LIME result based on three environmental impact category , i.e . resource consumption , global warming and ozonelayer depletion are presented and discussed . Findings - The attributional LCA ( ALCA ) result point towards a larger impact for Sn95.5Ag3.8Cu0.7 than Sn63Pb37 mostly due to the higher Sn and Ag content . This study confirms earlier similar ALCAs . The system expansion for the Consequential LCA ( CLCA ) did not change this conclusion . Research limitations/implications - The present study ha not included the affected microelectronics packaging part of electronic product , nor ha it included toxic effect a they are local . ALCA wa considered to be equal to CLCA for Sn95.5Ag3.8Cu0.7 , where no Ag nor Sn recycling wa included . Originality/value - For the first time a global environmental impact assessment of the shift to Pb-free solder paste using the LIME weighting method applied to a CLCA is reported . Environmental life-cycle investigation intended to support decision of an ecological nature in the microelectronics packaging industry should benefit from the consequential approach .

aVAnthropogenic climate change is widely expected to drive specie extinct by hampering individual survival and reproduction , by reducing the amount and accessibility of suitable habitat , or by eliminating other organism that are essential to the specie in question . Less well appreciated is the likelihood that climate change will directly disrupt or eliminate mutually beneficial ( mutualistic ) ecological interaction between specie even before extinction occur . We explored the potential disruption of a ubiquitous mutualistic interaction of terrestrial habitat , that between plant and their animal pollinator , via climate change . We used a highly resolved empirical network of interaction between 1420 pollinator and 429 plant specie to simulate consequence of the phenological shift that can be expected with a doubling of atmospheric CO ( 2 ) . Depending on model assumption , phenological shift reduced the floral resource available to 17-50 % of all pollinator specie , causing a much a half of the ancestral activity period of the animal to fall at time when no food plant were available . Reduced overlap between plant and pollinator also decreased diet breadth of the pollinator . The predicted result of these disruption is the extinction of pollinator , plant and their crucial interaction .

aVThe gonad histology , gonado-somatic index ( GSI ) , 17 beta-estradiol ( E-2 ) level and acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) activity in the carp specie Chalcalburnus tarichi from Lake Van and the Karasu river , eastern Turkey , have been investigated . Fish between 5 and 7 year old were sampled from November 2003 to February 2004 . The ratio of female fish caught in Lake Van with abnormal ovary ( AbOF ) wa 43.3 % , but the fork length and body weight of these fish were not correlated with this abnormality . The weight of the ovary and the GSI value of AbOF were very low ( P < 0.05 ) . Histological observation on the sample caught each month revealed that the oocyte had degenerated in the perinucleolus and early cortical alveolus stage and that the ovary were full of somatic stromal tissue . In addition , the seminiferous tubule of male fish with abnormal testis did not contain male reproductive cell at any stage . The ovary of the fish caught from the Karasu river were also full of oocyte in the perinucleolus and early cortical alveolus stage , but there were fewer atretic follicle . Furthermore , apoptosis wa observed in the ovary cell of these fish , in particular in the follicular cell , and the plasma E-2 level of the AbOF wa very low ( P < 0.05 ) . AChE activity wa inhibited only in liver ( P < 0.05 ) . We conclude that our sample of C. tarichi must have been exposed to various polluting chemical or another unknown factor ( such a global warming ) and that these factor have irreversibly impaired oocyte development in a high percentage of fish .

aVWith global warming , flowering at many location ha shifted toward earlier date of bloom . A steady increase in average annual temperature since the late 1890s make it likely that flowering also ha advanced in the northern Sonoran Desert of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico . In this study , phenological model were used to predict annual date of spring bloom in the northern Sonoran Desert from 1894 to 2004 ; then , herbarium specimen were assessed for objective evidence of the predicted shift in flowering time . The phenological model were derived from known flowering requirement ( trigger and heat sum ) of Sonoran Desert shrub . According to the model , flowering might have advanced by 20-41 d from 1894 to 2004 . Analysis of herbarium specimen collected during the 20 ( th ) century supported the model prediction . Over time , there wa a significant increase in the proportion of shrub specimen collected in flower in March and a significant decrease in the proportion collected in May . Thus , the flowering curve - the proportion of individual in flower in each spring month - shifted toward the start of the calendar year between 1900 and 1999 . This shift could not be explained by collection activity : collector showed no tendency to be active earlier in the year a time went on , nor did activity toward the end of spring decline in recent decade . Earlier bloom eventually could have substantial impact on plant and animal community in the Sonoran Desert , especially on migratory hummingbird and population dynamic of shrub .

aVBackground : The hot summer of 2003 brought about increased mortality in southern and western Europe , highlighting the health impact of heatwaves . No Austrian mortality data have yet been reported for this summer period . Methods : Daily mortality data for Vienna between 1998 and 2004 were obtained from Statistics Austria and meteorological data from the Austrian Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics . Heatwaves were defined using the Kysely criterion . Daily mortality for May to September wa predicted by a generalized additive model considering over- dispersion with Poisson deviate and a log link . Seasonal trend wa accounted for by a natural spline , weekday were modeled by dummy variable and heatwave day were included a dichotomous predictor . Results : The average seasonal temperature for May to September in Vienna ha increased by more than 1.7 C during the last 35 year . In 2003 there wa an excess of heatwave day , 44 overall , that resulted in an increased number of death , approximately 180 , most of which were not due to ` harvesting ' . Heatwave day between 1998 and 2004 were associated with a significantly increased relative mortality risk of 1.13 [ 95 % confidence interval 1.09 - 1.17 ] . This increase wa stronger in female than in male . Although excess mortality wa seen in all age group , it reached significance only in the elderly population over 65 year . Discussion : An impact of heatwaves on mortality wa apparent in Vienna , although not a pronounced a in France and south- western Europe . In 2003 at least 130 heatwave- related death in Vienna could have been avoided by prompt medical assistance and proper advice about how to cope with excessive thermal condition . Preventive program are warranted during heatwaves , especially to target elderly people , because the likelihood of heatwaves a a consequence of global warming is increasing .

aVAim The assumedly anomalous occurrence of savanna and forest-savanna mosaic in the Gran Sabana - a neotropical region under a climate more suitable for tropical rain forest - ha been attributed to a variety of historical , climatic , and anthropogenic factor . This paper describes a previously undocumented shift in vegetation and climate that occurred during the early Holocene , and evaluates it significance for the understanding of the origin of the Gran Sabana vegetation . Location A treeless savanna locality of the Gran Sabana ( 4 degree 30'-6 degree 45 ' N and 60 degree 34'-62 degree 50 ' W ) , in the Venezuelan Guayana of northern South America , at the headwater of the Caroni river , one of the major tributary of the Orinoco river . Methods Pollen and charcoal analysis of a previously dated peat section spanning from about the Pleistocene/Holocene boundary until the present . Results Mesothermic cloud forest dominated by Catostemma ( Bombacaceae ) occupied the site around the Pleistocene/Holocene boundary . During the early Holocene , a progressive but relatively rapid trend towards savanna vegetation occurred , and eventually the former cloud forest were replaced by a treeless savanna . Some time after the establishment of savanna , a marked increase in charcoal particle indicates the occurrence of the first local fire . Main conclusion The occurrence of cloud forest at the Pleistocene/Holocene boundary contradicts the historical hypothesis according to which the Gran Sabana is a relict of the hypothetical widespread savanna that have been assumed to have dominated the region during the last glaciation . The first local fire recorded in the Holocene were on savanna vegetation , which is against the hypothesis of fire a the triggering factor for the establishment of these savanna . Climate change , in the form of global warming and a persistently drier climate , emerges a the most probable cause for the forest-savanna turnover .

aVThe temperature in large part of Europe have been record high during the meteorological autumn of 2006 . Compared to 1961-1990 , the 2m temperature wa more than three degree Celsius above normal from the North side of the Alps to southern Norway . This made it by far the warmest autumn on record in the United Kingdom , Belgium , the Netherlands , Denmark , Germany and Switzerland , with the record in Central England going back to 1659 , in the Netherlands to 1706 and in Denmark to 1768 . The deviation were so large that under the obviously false assumption that the climate doe not change , the observed temperature for 2006 would occur with a probability of le than once every 10 000 year in a large part of Europe , given the distribution defined by the temperature in the autumn 1901-2005 . A better description of the temperature distribution is to assume that the mean change proportional to the global mean temperature , but the shape of the distribution remains the same . This includes to first order the effect of global warming . Even under this assumption the autumn temperature were very unusual , with estimate of the return time of 200 to 2000 year in this region . The lower bound of the 95 % confidence interval is more than 100 to 300 year . Apart from global warming , linear effect of a southerly circulation are found to give the largest contribution , explaining about half of the anomaly . SST anomaly in the North Sea were also important along the coast . Climate model that simulate the current atmospheric circulation well underestimate the observed mean rise in autumn temperature . They do not simulate a change in the shape of the distribution that would increase the probability of warm event under global warming . This implies that the warm autumn 2006 either wa a very rare coincidence , or the local temperature rise is much stronger than modelled , or non-linear physic that is missing from these model increase the probability of warm extreme .

aVDuring the hot summer of 2003 , reduction of an ice field in the Swiss Alps ( Schnidejoch ) uncovered spectacular archaeological hunting gear , fur , leather and woollen clothing and tool from four distinct window of time : Neolithic Age ( 4900 to 4450 cal . yr BP ) , early Bronze Age ( 4100-3650 cal . yr BP ) , Roman Age ( 1st-3rd century AD ) , and Medieval time ( 8-9th century AD and 14-15th century AD ) . Transalpine route connecting northern Italy with the northern Alps during these slot is consistent with late Holocene maximum glacier retreat . The age cohort of the artefact are separated which is indicative of glacier advance when the route wa difficult and not used for transit . The preservation of Neolithic leather indicates permanent ice cover at that site from ca . 4900 cal . yr BP until AD 2003 , implying that the ice cover wa smaller in 2003 than at any time during the last 5000 year . Current glacier retreat is unprecedented since at least that time . This is highly significant regarding the interpretation of the recent warming and the rapid loss of ice in the Alps .

aVClimate-change model predicta more intense hydrological cycle , with both increased and decreased amount of rainfall in area covered with temperate deciduous forest . These change could alter rate of litter decomposition , with consequence for rate of nutrient cycling in the forest ecosystem . To examine impact of predicted change in precipitation on the rate of decay of canopy leaf , we placed litterbags in replicated , fenced 14 m ( 2 ) low-rainfall and high-rainfall plot located under individual rainout shelter . Unfenced , open plot served a an ambient treatment . Litter in the high-rainfall and ambient plot decayed 50 % and 78 % faster , respectively , than litter in the low-rainfall plot . Litter in the ambient plot disappeared 20 % faster than in the high-rainfall treatment , perhaps via greater leaching during heavy rainfall event . Ambient rainfall during the experiment wa similar in total amount to the high-rainfall treatment , but wa more variable in intensity and timing . We used litterbags of different mesh size to examine whether change in rainfall might alter the impact of major category of the fauna on litter decay . However , we found no consistent evidence that excluding arthropod of different size affected litter decay rate within any of the three rainfall treatment . This research reveals that change in rainfall predicted to occur with global climate change will likely strongly alter rate of litter decay in deciduous forest . ( c ) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

aVThe issue of climate change ha surfaced a a potential impediment to effective long-range policy and management of water resource . The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) recently published a report substantiating the argument that global warming is occurring . The IPCC reported that while sustainable water yield may or may not be reduced in the long-term average , they will almost certainly be le reliable in the short term . Climate change challenge existing water resource management practice by adding uncertainty . This will be an especially troubling issue for transboundary water sharing agreement . The risk imposed by climate change to transboundary water sharing agreement are discussed and the agreement most at risk are identified by the region in which they are located .

aVThe impact of external forcing , including natural and anthropogenic , on the 20th century global warming were assessed with the use of the Grid Atmospheric Model of IAP/LASG Version 1.1.0 , following the standard coordinated experiment design of the Climate Variability and Predictability ( CLIVAR ) International Climate of the Twentieth Century Project ( C20C ) , Phase II . The result indicate that external forcing play an important role in the evolution of the land surface air temperature on interannual , decadal , and interdecadal time scale , and contributes greatly to the global warming in the following two period : the early twentieth century between the 1910s and the 1940s and the late twentieth century after the 1970s . External forcing also ha strong impact on the regional temperature change during the two warming period except for part of the Eurasia and the North America continent . In the cooling period , however , the impact of internal variability is dominant .

aVWe assessed the temporal change in and the relationship between the structure of the macroinvertebrate community and the environmental condition of the French Rhone River ( the river from Lake Geneva to the Mediterranean Sea ) over the last 20 year ( 1985-2004 ) . Multisite environmental and biological datasets were analysed using multiple CO-inertia analysis ( MCOA ) and Procrustean analysis . Changes in environmental condition were mainly marked by an improvement in water quality between 1985 and 1991 and by an increase in water temperature from 1985 onwards due to climate change . Improvement in water quality seemed to delay change in community structure under global warming . We then observed trend in community structure coupled with high temperature and a decrease in oxygen content . Interestingly , we observed both gradual change and rapid switch in community state . These shift seemed coupled to extreme hydroclimatic event ( i.e . pulse disturbance ) . Floods and the 2003 heatwave enhanced the development of eurytolerant and invasive taxon which were probably able to take advantage of gradual warming environmental condition . Despite various site-specific `` press '' constraint ( e.g . hydropower scheme , nuclear power plant ) , similar change in community structure were observed along the French Rhone River . Such consistency in temporal process at large geographical scale underlined the strength of hydroclimatic constraint on community dynamic compared to specific local disturbance . Finally , community structure did not show any sign of recovery , and their relative sensitivity to extreme hydroclimatic event seemed to increase with time . Thus , our result suggest that global change may reduce the resilience of current community state .

aVThe advent of global warming ha given rise to question about the impact of temperature/pollution interaction on the integrity of certain benthic organism like bivalve . This interaction wa examined in intertidal Mya arenaria clam from the Saguenay Fjord using the concept of cellular energy allocation and temperature-dependent mitochondrial electron transport ( METT ) activity . Clams were collected at low tide from six site ( two clean , four polluted ) for determination of condition factor ( weight/shell length ) , growth index ( age-to-length ratio ) , gonadal lipid and maturation index , gonad MET at various habitat temperature , METT , gill xanthine oxidase and gill DNA damage . Condition factor wa generally lower at the four polluted site , with growth index being severely affected at two of them . Gonadal maturation wa also significantly dampened at two of the four pollution-impacted site . Gill xanthine oxidase ( purine base salvage pathway ) and DNA strand break were significantly increased at most of the polluted site , confirming pollution-mediated damage in clam . Moreover , MET at 20 degree C , METT and gonad lipid were significantly induced at the polluted site . Clam condition factor wa negatively correlated with most of the biomarkers for cellular energy allocation ( gonadal lipid , MET and METT ) but not with gonadal maturation . DNA damage and xanthine oxidase were positively correlated with MET at 20 degree C and METT . This is the first report of electron transport in mitochondrion being more sensitive to incremental temperature increase in clam under pollution stress . The gradual warming of clam habitat would likely worsen the impact of pollution in feral clam population . Crown Copyright ( c ) 2006 Published by Elsevier Inc. All right reserved .

aVPolicies that attempt to curb greenhouse gas emission , allocate emission right , or distribute compensation to those most damaged by climate change must explicitly incorporate the international heterogeneity of the climate change threat . To capture the distinct susceptibility associated with lack of infrastructure , potential property loss , and gross human exposure , we develop an integration of climate change projection and poverty , wealth , and population metric . Our analysis show that most nation of the world are threatened by the interaction of regional climatic change with one or more relevant socioeconomic factor . Nations that have the highest level of poverty , wealth , and population face greater relative exposure in those dimension . However , for each of those socioeconomic indicator , spatial heterogeneity in projected climate change determines the overall international pattern of socioclimatic exposure . Our synthesis provides a critical missing piece to the climate change debate and should facilitate the formulation of climate policy that account for international variation in the threat of climate change across a range of socioeconomic dimension .

aVThe evolution of the Earth 's climate over the twenty- first century depends on the rate at which anthropogenic carbon dioxide emission are removed from the atmosphere by the ocean and land carbon cycle ( 1 ) . Coupled climate - carbon cycle model suggest that global warming will act to limit the land- carbon sink ( 2 ) , but these first generation model neglected the impact of changing atmospheric chemistry . Emissions associated with fossil fuel and biomass burning have acted to approximately double the global mean tropospheric ozone concentration ( 3 ) , and further increase are expected over the twenty- first century ( 4 ) . Tropospheric ozone is known to damage plant , reducing plant primary productivity and crop yield ( 5 ) , yet increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration are thought to stimulate plant primary productivity ( 6 ) . Increased carbon dioxide and ozone level can both lead to stomatal closure , which reduces the uptake of either gas , and in turn limit the damaging effect of ozone and the carbon dioxide fertilization of photosynthesis ( 6 ) . Here we estimate the impact of projected change in ozone level on the land- carbon sink , using a global land carbon cycle model modified to include the effect of ozone deposition on photosynthesis and to account for interaction between ozone and carbon dioxide through stomatal closure ( 7 ) . For a range of sensitivity parameter based on manipulative field experiment , we find a significant suppression of the global land- carbon sink a increase in ozone concentration affect plant productivity . In consequence , more carbon dioxide accumulates in the atmosphere . We suggest that the resulting indirect radiative forcing by ozone effect on plant could contribute more to global warming than the direct radiative forcing due to tropospheric ozone increase .

aV[ 1 ] A comprehensive set of hydrological parameterizations without any basin-scale calibration wa recently introduced into the global ISBA land surface model in order to improve the simulation of the hydrological impact of both seasonal climate anomaly and global warming . In this study , the same approach is introduced into the Noah land surface model , in order to improve the representation of surface runoff . The Dunne runoff is computed using topographic information via a TOPMODEL approach and the Horton runoff using an explicit distinction between frozen and unfrozen soil , while land surface heterogeneity are introduced via a tile approach . The validation is conducted at a 1 degree by 1 degree horizontal resolution using global off line simulation that were driven by Global Soil Wetness Project atmospheric forcing . The simulated runoff is converted into discharge using the TRIP river routing model and compared to observation from a dense network of gauging station distributed over the world 's largest river basin . Results confirm that the relationship between the Dunne runoff and the topography , a well a between the Horton runoff and the frozen soil , are among the main hydrological process to simulate realistic global river discharge . The comparison between the old and the new version of Noah and ISBA reveal that the model disparity , in term of water flux production , is globally reduced due to the use of similar surface hydrology that lead to comparable improvement of discharge score . This confirms the relevance of these surface hydrological process for regional and global application .

As a result of regulation intended to reduce human exposure , crop contamination with aflatoxin cause significant economic loss for producer , marketer , and processor of diverse susceptible crop . Aflatoxin contamination occurs when specific fungi in the genus Aspergillus infect crop . Many industry frequently affected by aflatoxin contamination know from experience and anecdote that fluctuation in climate impact the extent of contamination . Climate influence contamination , in part , by direct effect on the causative fungi . As climate shift , so do the complex community of aflatoxin-producing fungi . This includes change in the quantity of aflatoxin-producers in the environment and alteration to fungal community structure . Fluctuations in climate also influence predisposition of host to contamination by altering crop development and by affecting insect that create wound on which aflatoxin-producers proliferate . Aflatoxin contamination is prevalent both in warm humid climate and in irrigated hot desert . In temperate region , contamination may be severe during drought . The contamination process is frequently broken down into two phase with the first phase occurring on the developing crop and the second phase affecting the crop after maturation . Rain and temperature influence the phase differently with dry , hot condition favoring the first and warm , wet condition favoring the second . Contamination varies with climate both temporally and spatially . Geostatistics and multiple regression analysis have shed light on influence of weather on contamination . Geostatistical analysis have been used to identify recurrent contamination pattern and to match these with environmental variable . In the process environmental condition with the greatest impact on contamination are identified . Likewise , multiple regression analysis allow ranking of environmental variable based on relative influence on contamination . Understanding the impact of climate may allow development of improved management procedure , better allocation of monitoring effort , and adjustment of agronomic practice in anticipation of global climate change .

aVAn approach to considering change in flooding probability in the integrated assessment of climate change is introduced . A reduced-form hydrological model for flood prediction and a downscaling approach suitable for integrated assessment modeling are presented . Based on these component , the fraction of world population living in river basin affected by change in flooding probability in the course of climate change is determined . This is then used a a climate impact response function in order to derive emission corridor limiting the population affected . This approach illustrates the consideration of probabilistic impact within the framework of the tolerable window approach . Based on the change in global mean temperature , a calculated by the simple climate model used in integrated assessment , spatially resolved change in climatic variable are determined using pattern scaling , while natural variability in these variable is considered using twentieth century deviation from the climatology . Driven by the spatially resolved climate change , the hydrological model then aggregate these change to river basin scale . The hydrological model is subjected to a sensitivity analysis with regard to the water balance , and the uncertainty arising through the different projection of change in mean climate by differing climate model is considered by presenting result based on different model . The result suggest that up to 20 % of world population live in river basin that might inevitably be affected by increased flood event in the course of global warming , depending on the climate model used to estimate the regional distribution of change in climate .

aVThis study present a modeling tool to ass emission of greenhouse gas ( GHG ) from the agricultural sector a affected by land-use and residue utilization option . The overall purpose of this tool is twofold : ( i ) a spreadsheet model for comprehensive compilation of the direct and indirect emission from land management , residue-burning and fossil fuel consumption through on-farm and off-farm operation and ( ii ) a decision support tool to explore economically viable mitigation option through detailed cost-benefit analysis of different technological option . We developed TechnoGAS ( technical coefficient generator for mitigation technology of greenhouse gas emission from agricultural sector ) , which integrates analytical and expert knowledge with regional database on bio-physical , agronomic and socio-economic feature to establish input-output relationship ( 'Technical Coefficients ' ) related to GHG emission in agriculture . The approach includes emission of methane ( CH4 ) from rice field , rice straw burning and cattle ; carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) from fossil fuel and soil organic carbon decline a well a nitrous oxide ( N2O ) from soil , rice straw burning and fertilizer use . To illustrate the approach of the spreadsheet model for comprehensive compilation of emission , we applied TechnoGAS for an entire rice-wheat cropping cycle in the state of Haryana in northern India a a case study . Twenty technology of rice production , which can be adopted by farmer , are analysed for their operation-specific emission including their global warming potential ( GWP ) . The technology differ in term of water regime , residue management/utilization , soil management and additive , which represent different mitigation option for GHG emission . With the current farmer ' practice in various district in Haryana , soil-borne emission are the major source of GHG contributing 53 % of the average GWP ( 3288 kg CO2 equivalent ha ( -1 ) ) in rice followed by burning of rice straw ( 13 % of the GWP ) . Cattle , farm operation , off-farm and inorganic fertilizer contributes 12 % , 10 % , 10 % and 2 % of the GWP , respectively . Emissions from wheat are relatively low ( 1204 kg CO , equivalent ha-1 ) a there is no CH4 emission and wheat straw is not burnt . Different mitigation technology show pronounced effect on the GWP of the rice crop and varied between 1715 kg CO2 equivalent ha ( -1 ) with continuous flooding , urea and rice straw used for building material and 10,020 kg CO2 equivalent ha ( -1 ) with continuous flooding , and application of nutrient through organic manure . Compared to current farmer ' practice , 13 technology are found to have the potential to reduce the GWP by 8-51 % , but they also reduce the net income of farmer . Upscaling of the estimate to the entire state of Haryana show that the GWP with the current farmer ' practice in rice is 2617 Gg CO2 equivalent . Modification of water management from continuous flooding to alternate flooding or application of urea alone instead of urea plus FYM will reduce the GWP by 15 % and 29 % , respectively , while feeding of rice straw to cattle and supplying N through urea will reduce it by 41 % compared to the current practice of burning rice straw and use of FYM . The study show that the TechnoGAS tool can be used for estimating GHG emission from various land-use type and for identifying promising mitigation option .

aVOne of the most significant anticipated consequence of global climate change is the increased frequency of hydrologic extreme . Predictions of climate change impact on the regime of hydrologic extreme have traditionally been conducted using a top-down approach . The top-down approach involves a high degree of uncertainty associated with global circulation model ( GCM ) output and the choice of downscaling technique . This study attempt to explore an inverse approach to the modelling of hydrologic risk and vulnerability to changing climatic condition . With a focus targeted at end-users , the proposed approach first identifies critical hydrologic exposure that may lead to local failure of existing water resource system . A hydrologic model is used to transform inversely the main hydrologic exposure , such a flood and drought , into corresponding meteorological condition . The frequency of critical meteorological situation is investigated under present and future climatic scenario by mean of a generic weather generator . The weather generator , linked with GCMs at the last step of the proposed methodology , allows the creation of an ensemble of different scenario , a well a an easy updating , when new and improved GCM output become available . The technique ha been applied in Ontario , Canada . The result show significant change in the frequency of hydro-climatic extreme under future climate scenario in the study area .

aVGlobal climate change is generally expected to increase net primary production , resulting in increased soil carbon ( C ) input . To gain an understanding of how such increased soil C input would affect C cycling in the vast grassland of northern China , we conducted a field experiment in which the response of plant and microbial biomass and respiration were studied . Our experiment included the below-ground addition of particulate organic matter ( POM ) at rate equivalent to 0 , 60 , 120 and 240 g C m ( -2 ) , under either natural precipitation or under enhanced precipitation during the summer period ( a predicted for that region in recent simulation using general circulation model ) . We observed that addition of POM had a large effect on soil microbial biomass and activity and that a major part of the added C wa rapidly lost from the system . This suggests that microbial activity in the vast temperate grassland ecosystem of northern China is energy-limited . Moreover , POM addition ( and the associated nutrient release ) affected plant growth much more than the additional water input . Although we performed no direct fertilization experiment , the response of plant productivity to POM addition ( and associated release of nutrient ) lead u to believe that plant productivity in the semiarid grassland ecosystem of northern China is primarily limited by nutrient and not by water .

aVRecent observation based on ocean colour show that summer productivity in the western Arabian Sea ha been increasing during the last seven year , reportedly due to the warming of the Eurasian land mass . Our analysis of eight year ' record of satellite ocean colour data over northeastern Arabian Sea suggests that chlorophyll concentration ha not changed significantly in this region , and is thrice that in the southeastern part . Although we see some seasonal variation in different part of the Arabian Sea , a significant secular trend is not discernible . The reported trend in Chla in the western Arabian Sea is not observed in the eastern Arabian Sea . Hence , we conclude that the increasing trend in the western Arabian Sea may not be entirely attributable to global warming .

aVBackground , Aims and Scope . This study aim to compare the energy requirement and potential environmental impact associated with three different commercial laundry process for washing microbiologically contaminated hospital and care home laundry . Thermal disinfection relies mainly on a 90 degree C washing temperature and hydrogen peroxide , while the chernothermal disinfection us a combination of chemical ( mainly peracetic acid ) and 70 degree C washing temperature . The chemical disinfection process relies on a combination of chemical used at 40 degree C. Currently , chernothermal process are the most commonly used in professional laundry . Traditional chemical process are uncommon due to drawback of longer residence time and high chemical requirement . However , the innovative Sterisan chemical process based on plithalimidoperoxyhexanoic acid ( PAP ) which is the key subject of this Life Cycle Assessment - wa designed to overcome these technical limitation . Methods . This study is based on a screening Life Cycle Assessment ( LCA ) prepared in 2002 by Oko-Institut ( Germany ) , which wa carried out following the requirement of the ISO 14040 series standard . It includes energy resource consumption , water resource consumption , climate change , eutrophication and acidification potential a relevant environmental indicator . In 2004/2005 , the study wa further updated and broadened to include the aquatic eco-toxicity potential , photochemical oxidant formation and ozone depletion potential in order to represent the environmental burden associated with the chemical used . Based on available data , the system boundary include detergent manufacturing , the professional wash process , waste water treatment , but excluding the laundry finishing process . The selected functional unit wa 1 kg washed hygiene laundry . Results and Discussion . The LCA indicates that the Sterisan chemical process ha a lower potential environmental impact than thermal or chernothermal treatment for six out of seven key indicator . This includes a 55 % lower energy and a 46 % lower water consumption . The global warming potential and acidification potential are approximately halved , while the photochemical oxidant formation potential and eutrophication potential are almost reduced to one third . By contrast , for the aquatic eco-toxicity , the thermal- and chernothermal process have an approximately 17-fold lower impact . The worse aquatic toxicity score for the Sterisan process is mainly caused by a solvent component in the formulation . Conclusion . The comparison of the thermal , chernothermal and Sterisan commercial laundry process show that the Sterisan process allows for very substantial reduction in energy and water consumption , a well a significant reduction in climate change , photochemical oxidant formation potential , air acidification potential and eutrophication potential . Yet , Sterisan ha a clear disadvantage with regard to aquatic eco-toxicity potential . Recommendation and Perspective . Based on a current hygiene laundry volume of approx . 584,000 ton of linen washed per year by commercial laundry in Germany , a full substitution of the market to the Sterisan process could potentially allow a primary energy saving of similar to 750,000 GJ/year ( roughly equivalent to the residential primary energy consumption of 23,500 German citizen or the overall energy demand of approx . 6,000 German citizen ) . In term of improvement to the respective process , the chernothermal and thermal process could benefit from a reduction of water volume , and change of detergent composition to reduce the eutrophication potential . As the washing temperature is an essential factor , only slight improvement for the energy consumption indicator can be obtained , e.g . by choosing green electricity and reducing the amount of water to be heated . The Sterisan process could be improved by lowering the solvent use , although for perspective , the current aquatic eco-toxicity score of the Sterisan process is still lower than that of a typical domestic laundry product .

aVTwo disposal method for MSWI bottom ash were assessed in a new life cycle assessment ( LCA ) model for road construction and disposal of residue . The two scenario evaluated in the model were : ( i ) landfilling of bottom ash in a coastal landfill in Denmark and ( ii ) recycling of bottom ash a subbase layer in an asphalted secondary road . The LCA included resource and energy consumption , and emission associated with upgrading of bottom ash , transport , landfilling process , incorporation of bottom ash in road , substitution of natural gravel a road construction material and leaching of heavy metal and salt from bottom ash in road a well a in landfill . Environmental impact associated with emission to air , fresh surface water , marine surface water , groundwater and soil were aggregated into 12 environmental impact category : Global Warming , Photochemical Ozone Formation , Nutrient Enrichment , Acidification , Stratospheric Ozone Depletion , Human Toxicity via air/water/soil , Ecotoxicity in water/soil , and a new impact category , Stored Ecotoxicity to water/soil that account for the presence of heavy metal and very persistent organic compound that in the long-term might leach . Leaching of heavy metal and salt from bottom ash wa estimated from a series of laboratory leaching test . For both scenario , Ecotoxicity ( water ) wa , when evaluated for the first 100 yr , the most important among the twelve impact category involved in the assessment . Human Toxicity ( soil ) wa also important , especially for the Road scenario . When the long-term leaching of heavy metal from bottom ash wa evaluated , based on the total content of heavy metal in bottom ash , all impact category became negligible compared to the potential Stored Ecotoxicity , which wa two order of magnitude greater than Ecotoxicity ( water ) wa the constituent that gave the strongest contribution to the ecotoxicities . The most important resource consumed were clay a liner in landfill and the groundwater resource which wa potentially spoiled due to leaching of salt from bottom ash in road . The difference in environmental impact between landfilling and utilization of bottom ash in road wa marginal when these alternative were assessed in a life cycle perspective .

aVLife cycle assessment wa performed to evaluate environmental impact of two municipal solid waste ( MSW ) to energy scheme currently practiced in Thailand : incineration and anaerobic digestion . Potential impact such a global warming , acidification , stratospheric ozone depletion , and photo-oxidant formation were avoided due to net electricity production and also fertilizer production a by-product from the anaerobic digestion scheme . In addition , the anaerobic digestion resulted in the higher net energy output compared to the incineration scheme . However , the incineration had le potential impact for nutrient enrichment . The LCA result were also useful in determining where the improvement could be made for both the scheme . In order to adopt a sustainable waste management system elsewhere in the country , decision maker may need to consider a combination of technique , or an integrated method of management . LCA could serve a an invaluable tool for such an analysis . ( C ) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVGoal , Scope and Background . The environmental sustainability is one of the current priority of the Portuguese pulp and paper industry . Life Cycle Assessment ( LCA ) wa the methodology chosen to evaluate the sustainability of the printing and writing paper production activity . This paper grade represents about 60 % of the total production of paper in Portugal and it production is expected to increase in the near future . The main goal of this study wa to ass the potential environmental impact associated with the entire life cycle of the printing and writing paper produced in Portugal from Eucalyptus globulus pulp and consumed in Germany , in order to identify the process with the largest environmental impact . Another goal of this study wa to evaluate the effect on the potential environmental impact of changing the market where the Portuguese printing and writing paper is consumed : German market vs. Portuguese market . Methods . The main stage considered in this study were : forestry , pulp production , paper production , paper distribution , and paper final disposal . Transports and production of chemical , fuel and energy in the grid were also included in these stage . Whenever possible and feasible , average or typical data from industry were collected . The remaining data were obtained from the literature and specialised database . A quantitative impact assessment wa performed for five impact category : global warming over 100 year , acidification , eutrophication , non-renewable resource depletion and photochemical oxidant formation . Results . In the German market scenario , the paper production stage wa a remarkable hot spot for air emission ( non-renewable CO2 , NOx and SO2 ) and for non-renewable energy consumption , and , consequently , for the impact category that consider these parameter : global warming , acidification and non-renewable resource depletion . These important environmental impact are due to the energy requirement in the printing and writing paper production process , which are fulfilled by on-site fuel oil burning and consumption of electricity from the national grid , which is mostly based on the use of fossil fuel . The pulp production stage wa identified a the largest contributor to water emission ( COD and AOX ) and to eutrophication . Considering that energy consumed by the pulp production process come from renewable fuel , this stage wa also the most contributing to renewable energy consumption . Discussion . The paper distribution stage showed an important contribution to NOx emission , which , however , did not result in a major contribution to acidification or eutrophication . The final disposal stage wa the main contributor to the photochemical oxidant formation potential due to CH4 emission from wastepaper landfilling . On the other hand , paper consumption in Portugal wa environmentally more favourable than in Germany for the parameters/impact category where the paper distribution stage ha a significant contribution ( non-renewable CO2 , NOx , non-renewable energy consumption , acidification , eutrophication and nonrenewable resource depletion ) due to shorter distance needed to deliver paper to the consumer . For the remaining parameters/impact category , the increase observed in the final disposal stage in the Portuguese market wa preponderant , and resulted from the existence of significant difference in the final disposal alternative in the analysed market ( recycling dominates in Germany , whereas landfilling dominates in Portugal ) . Conclusions . The pulp and paper production stage were found to be of significance for almost all of the inventory parameter a well a for the impact assessment category . The paper distribution and the final disposal stage were only of importance for some of the inventory parameter and some of the impact category . The forestry stage played a minor role in the environmental impact generated during the paper life cycle . The consumption of paper in Portugal led to a decrease in the environmental burden of the paper distribution stage , but to an increase in the environmental burden of the final disposal stage , when compared with the consumption of paper in Germany . Recommendations and Perspectives . This study provides useful information that can assist the pulp and paper industry in the planning of future investment leading to an increase in it sustainability . The result of inventory analysis and impact assessment show the process that play an important role in each impact category , which allow the industry to improve it environmental performance , making change not only in the production process itself , but also in the treatment of flue gas and liquid effluent . Besides that concern regarding pollution prevention , other issue with relevance to the context of sustainability , such a the energy consumption , can also be dealt with .

aVThe waste hierarchy is being widely discussed these day , not only by cost-benefit analyst , but a growing number of life cycle assessment ( LCA ) have also begun to question it . In this article , we investigate the handling of waste paper in Denmark and compare the present situation with scenario of more waste being recycled , incinerated or consigned to landfill . The investigation are made in accordance with ISO 14040-43 and based on the newly launched methodology of consequential LCA and following the recent guideline of the European Centre on Waste and Material Flows . The LCA concern the Danish consumption of paper in 1999 , totalling 1.2 million ton . The result of the investigation indicate that the waste hierarchy is reliable ; from an environmental point of view recycling of paper is better than incineration and landfilling . For incineration , the reason for the advantage of landfilling mainly come from the substitution of fossil fuel , when incinerator provide heat and electricity . For recycling , the advantage is related to the saved wood resource , which can be used for generating energy from wood , i.e. , from renewable fuel which doe not contribute to global warming .

aVMicrogrids-generating system incorporating multiple distributed generator set linked together to provide local electricity and heat-are one possible alterative to the existing centralized energy system . Potential advantage of microgrids include flexibility in fuel supply option , the ability to limit emission of greenhouse gas , and energy efficiency improvement through combined heat and power ( CHP ) application . As a case study in microgrid performance , this analysis us a life cycle assessment approach to evaluate the energy and emission performance of the NextEnergy microgrid Power Pavilion in Detroit , Michigan and a reference conventional system . The microgrid includes generator set fueled by solar energy , hydrogen , and natural gas . Hydrogen fuel is sourced from both a natural gas steam reforming operation and a a by-product of a chlorine production operation . The chlorine plant receives electricity exclusively from a hydropower generating station . Results indicate that the use of this microgrid offer a total energy reduction potential of up to 38 % , while reduction in non-renewable energy use could reach 51 % . Similarly , emission Of CO ( 2 ) , a key global warming gas , can be reduced by a much a 60 % relative to conventional heat and power system . Hydrogen fuel are shown to provide a net energy and emission benefit relative to natural gas only when sourced primarily from the chlorine plant . Copyright ( c ) 2006 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd .

aVThis paper give an overview of the potential on multi-criteria assessment of fuel . In order to apply the multi-criteria approach to fuel , it wa necessary to use the multi-criteria procedure based on the sustainability index rating composed of linear aggregative function of all indicator with weighting function . The example under consideration are conventional gasoline ( CG ) , conventional diesel oil ( CD ) , compressed natural gas ( CNG ) , mixture of 85 % methanol ( derived from natural gas ) and 15 % gasoline by volume ( M85 ) , mixture of 85 % ethanol ( derived from corn ) and 15 % gasoline by volume ( E85 ) , and pure cassava-based ethanol ( E100 ) . These option are evaluated with the multi-criteria method comprising the following indicator : life cycle cost ( LCC ) , global warming potential ( GWP ) , net energy yield ( NE ) , non-renewable resource depletion potential ( NRDP ) indicator . The evaluation of option under consideration wa performed under constraint expressing non-numeric relation among the indicator . ( c ) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd .

aVLithoglyphus naticoides wa observed for the first time in the north of France at the beginning of the 19th century , but since then this gastropod ha only succeeded in colonising the eastern half of this country . A map showing it distribution in France is proposed . In the Saone river , L. naticoides is an annual specie : spawning occurs from March to June and the juvenile that Generally appear in May Grow rapidly during the summer then spawn and disappear in the spring of the following year . Different observation suggest that increased water temperature occurring in the context of global warming and potential/possible interspecific competition are the main reason for the disappearance of L. naticoides in the Saone river at Lyon since November 2004 .

aVBackground and Aims Germination and seedling establishment , which are critical stage in the regeneration process of plant population , may be subjected to natural selection and adaptive evolution . The aim of this work were to ass the main limitation on offspring performance of Silene ciliata , a high mountain Mediterranean plant , and to test whether local adaptation at small spatial scale ha a significant effect on the success of establishment . Methods Reciprocal sowing experiment were carried out among three population of the specie to test for evidence of local adaptation on seedling emergence , survival and size . Studied population were located at the southernmost margin of the specie ' range , along the local elevation gradient that lead to a drought stress gradient . Key Results Drought stress in summer wa the main cause of seedling mortality even though germination mainly occurred immediately after snowmelt to make the best use of soil moisture . The result support the hypothesis that specie perform better at the centre of their altitudinal range than at the boundary . Evidence wa also found of local adaptation in seedling survival and growth along the whole gradient . Conclusions The local adaptation acting on seedling emergence and survival favour the persistence of remnant population on the altitudinal and latitudinal margin of mountain specie . In a global warming context , such process may help to counteract the contraction of this specie ' range and the consequent loss of habitat area .

aV[ 1 ] The sampling error of Global Positioning System ( GPS ) radio occultation ( RO ) derived temperature climatology is computed over a representative time span of 2 year and compared for Sun-synchronous and non-Sun-synchronous Low Earth Orbit ( LEO ) satellite . The main focus lie on the sampling error 's local time component , which is caused by incomplete sampling of the diurnal cycle and which depends on the geometry of the satellite orbit . The Sun-synchronous satellite MetOp ( Meteorological Operational European weather satellite ) and the non-Sun-synchronous satellite CHAMP ( Challenging Minisatellite Payload ) , both carrying GPS RO instrument on board , serve a representative case . For the Sun-synchronous satellite MetOp the local time component remains constant during the whole observation period such that the magnitude of the local time error in monthly mean or longer-term mean RO climatology is generally lower than +/- 0.1 K. Except for potential long-term effect of global warming on the diurnal cycle , which might require calibration , this small local time component is stable on decadal timescales and is mainly positive in the Northern Hemisphere and at low latitude , whereas it is mainly negative in the Southern Hemisphere . These feature are attributable to a slight orbit-determined asymmetry in local time sampling . The typical ( temporally stable ) local time error of an annual mean MetOp climatology resolved into 18 zonal band amount to similar to 0.04 K. For the non-Sun-synchronous satellite CHAMP the local time error component in monthly mean RO climatology is also small ( up to about +/- 0.15 K ) but more variable ( about zero mean ) at middle and high latitude . At low latitude it result in sinusoidally varying positive and negative deviation with a several-months period , resulting from the local time drift of the satellite . The magnitude of local time error is slightly larger compared to MetOp since the monthly averaging period is too short for CHAMP to entirely sample a diurnal cycle ; a longer averaging period further decrease CHAMP 's local time component . An annual mean climatology resolved into 18 zonal band show for CHAMP a typical local time residual error component of similar to 0.03 K. The overall evidence is that even with single RO satellite , monthly climatology of high accuracy ( sampling error < 0.3 K ) with the local time component being a minor part ( < 0.1 K to 0.15 K ) can be obtained .

aVRising atmospheric carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) concentration and air temperature are of major concern when considering the possible effect of global climate change on vegetation . Although production ha been found to increase in many case , other experiment have also indicated increased hazard for plant growth because of the increased frequency of weather extreme , such a drought , flood , and extreme temperature . Thus at the same time elevated CO2 and the extreme climatic event , intra- and interannual climatic variability alone can be foreseen a an indirect constraint , which separately influence significantly the carbon cycling in ecosystem , too . In the shorter term the effect Of CO2 is direct and is mediated by photosynthesis . In the longer term the effect of elevated CO2 became more and more indirect and it effect are mediated by source-sink interaction within plant , resource ( nutrient , water ) , temperature , microbe , herbivore , and land-use management practice . In fact , the plant can make use of their general stress coping mechanism to avoid or compensate possible negative effect of elevated CO2 . One ha to consider that all the classical abiotic , biotic , and anthropogenic stressor are threatening plant growth and development also under elevated CO2 , although at possibly different dos compared to ambient CO2 concentration . Therefore , the knowledge of the general stress coping , stress avoiding , and tolerance mechanism is needed to understand the regulation of the plant ' metabolism under normal and elevated CO2 level .

aVSince the rate of global climate change began to accelerate in the 1980s , the coastal sea of Britain have warmed by tip to l degree C. Locations close to the northern range edge of a southern trochid gastropod Osilinus lineatus in Britain previously surveyed in the 1950s and 1980s were resurveyed during 2002-2004 to determine whether change in the success of near-limit population had occurred during the period of climate warming . Between the 1980s and the 2000s , the range limit had extended by up to 55 krn . Populations sampled over a latitudinal extent of 4 degree from northern limit towards the centre of the range showed synchronous increase in abundance throughout the year sampled , suggesting a large-scale factor such a climate wa driving the observed change . These increase in abundance and change in range limit are likely to have occurred via increased recruitment success in recent year .

aVMuggelsee , a shallow eutrophic lake ( Berlin , Germany ) , ha been subject to global warming and concurrent reduction of anthropogenic nutrient loading during the past decade . Here , we focus on the recent increase in abundance of Dreissena polymorpha larva . We aimed at ascertaining whether the change in abundance of larva wa driven by change in climate , especially by climate warming , and/or by the concurrent change in trophic state of the lake . Both the number of small , newly developed larva and their length have increased in recent year , suggesting that condition for overall reproductive success have improved . The timing of the increase in abundance of larva wa matched by change in nutrient loading and phytoplankton biomass , induced by a reduced inflow of nutrient into the lake . Besides a correlation between the first appearance of larva each year and the timing of the requisite temperature for first spawning ( 12 degree C ) , no relationship between change in water temperature and abundance , length and survival rate of larva wa found . However , a sudden drop in abundance of larva in 2003 may be primarily attributed to low dissolved oxygen condition during an unusually long period of stratification , induced by anomalous meteorological condition . The increase in length and survival rate of larva wa most likely due to change in food composition , which followed the decrease in nutrient availability , and to change in the occurrence of planktivorous fish . The result suggest that the first appearance of larva per year and the decline in abundance of larva in 2003 were driven by climatic influence , while the overall increase in abundance and length of D. polymorpha larva in Muggelsee wa more likely caused by change in the trophic state of the lake rather than by climate warming .

aVRelict endangered population may be especially vulnerable to the effect of climate change . A data series for the period 1974-2003 wa used to examine shift in brown bear Ursus arctos food habit in it south-westernmost European population . This focused on the hyperphagic season , when bear gain the fat that is essential for winter dormancy and reproduction . General climatic indicator were predictor of diet trend . Other variable potentially able to modify brown bear food habit at the local scale were accounted for by considering two area where local condition changed in different way during the study period . General climatic indicator such a temperature and the winter North Atlantic Oscillation index were good predictor of some diet trend , although local factor seemed to modulate the potential response of food habit to recent climate change . Boreal and temperate food item decreasingly contributed to brown bear diet , replaced by increasing contribution of southern food , which suggested that warmer temperature might determine the occurrence of some food item in the diet of Cantabrian brown bear through effect on plant distribution and phenology . At the local scale , high cattle density in one of the study area limited food source available for brown bear . Important food source for brown bear , such a heath-like Vaccinium formation and old-growth oak forest in the Cantabrian Mountains , require increased level of protection .

aVThe east coast of India and the coast of Bangladesh , Myanmar and Sri Lanka are vulnerable to the incidence of tropical cyclone of the Bay of Bengal . Every year these cyclone inflict heavy loss of life and property in this region . Global climate change resulting from anthropogenic activity is likely to manifest itself in the weather and climate of the Bay of Bengal region also . The long-term trend in the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclone of the Bay of Bengal during intense cyclonic month May , October and November is one such problem which ha been addressed in the present paper . Utilizing the existing data of 129 year ( 1877-2005 ) pertaining to the tropical cyclone frequency and intensity in the Bay of Bengal during May , October and November , a study wa undertaken to investigate the trend in the frequency of Severe Cyclonic Storms ( SCS ) during past decade . The result of the trend analysis reveal that the SCS frequency over the Bay of Bengal ha registered significant increasing trend in past 129 year during the intense cyclonic month . It may be emphasized that these trend are long-term trend for more than hundred year based on statistical analysis which do not necessarily imply that SCS frequency ha increased continuously decade after decade . As a matter of fact there ha been a slight decrease in SCS frequency after peaking in the pentad 1966-1970 , but this doe not alter the long-term trend much . The intensification rate during November , which account for highest number of intense cyclone in the north Indian Ocean , ha registered a steep rise of 26 % per hundred year , implying that a tropical depression forming in the Bay of Bengal during November ha a high probability to reach to severe cyclone stage . A regional climate model simulation revealed the enhanced cyclogenesis in the Bay of Bengal during May , October and November a a result of increased anthropogenic emission in the atmosphere .

This glacial record provides the first terrestrial evidence linking middle Miocene global climate cooling to a permanent reorganization of the Antarctic cryosphere and to subsequent growth of the polar East Antarctic Ice Sheet . The composite stratigraphic record constructed from field mapping and analysis of 281 soil excavation show a classic wet-based till ( Circe till , including an extensive melt-out facies ) , overlain by a weathered colluvial deposit ( Electra colluvium ) , and then a series of stacked till deposited from cold-based ice ( Dido drift ) . Chronologic control come from Ar-40/Ar-39 analysis of concentrated ash-fall deposit interbedded within glacial deposit . The shift from wet- to cold-based glaciation reflects a drop in mean annual temperature of 25-30 degree C and is shown to precede one or more major episode of ice-sheet expansion across the region , the youngest of which occurred between 13.62 and 12.44 Ma . One implication is that atmospheric cooling , following a relatively warm mid-Miocene climatic optimum ca . 17 to 15 Ma , may have led to , and thus triggered , maximum ice-sheet overriding .

aVCadaverine , the expected raw material of polyamide , is produced by decarboxylation Of L-lysine . If we could produce cadaverine from the cheapest sugar , and a a renewable resource , it would be an effective solution against global warming , but there ha been no attempt to produce cadaverine from glucose by fermentation . We focused on Corynebacterium glutamicum , whose L-lysine fermentation ability is superior , and constructed a metabolically engineered C glutamicum in which the L-homoserine dehydrogenase gene ( hom ) wa replaced by the L-lysine decarboxylase gene ( cadA ) of Escherichia coli . In this recombinant strain , cadaverine wa produced at a concentration of 2.6g/l , equivalent to up to 9.1 % ( molecular yield ) of the glucose transformed into cadaverine in neutralizing cultivation . This is the first report of cadaverine fermentation by C. glutamicum .

aVDue to global warming , water is expected to become scarce especially in semiarid region . Therefore , there is a need to increase the efficiency in water use by crop under rainfed agriculture . The effect of nutrient availability on the growth , production , root development , water relation and water use efficiency ( WUE ) by the intercrop maize/cowpea wa investigated in 2 contrasting year ( dry and wet ) in the semiarid region of Brazil . The crop were grown on a strongly acidic , sandy soil with three treatment : ( i ) application of NPK fertilizer plus lime ( NPK + lime ) , ( ii ) application of NPK fertilizer ( NPK ) and ( ii ) control ( Contr . ) in low and high input regime . The soil water balance wa calculated with the crop model EPICSEAR . Application of fertilizer and lime increased biomass production and grain yield of the intercrop up to 400 % and 550 % , respectively , and maize suffered more from the effect of low nutrient availability and soil acidity than cowpea . The root development of both crop wa strongly improved by the application of NPK and lime and cowpea developed a deeper root system which enabled this crop to keep a higher transpiration rate in the dry year . As a consequence of the shallow root system , maize wa prone to water stress caused by the dry spell and it harvest index wa reduced when dry spell occurred during flowering and grain filling . Fertilizers and lime application reduced deep percolation and soil evaporation while increasing the productive transpiration flow . WUE were improved through the application of nutrient and lime and maize showed higher WUE than cowpea . The omission of lime showed only minor effect on the evaporation and transpiration WUE . The model probably over-emphasizes the effect of high At saturation on the root growth and water uptake and consequently underestimated the transpiration rate of the crop . Nevertheless , the gross WUE wa reduced up to 58 % when lime wa omitted and NPK applied at high input . A balanced fertilization in combination with lime improves the root development of a maize/cowpea intercrop in acid Acrisols of the semiarid NE of Brazil . The improved root development allows a better use of soil water reserve and increase the WUE of the system . ( c ) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V .

aVThe forecasted shortage of fossil fuel and the ever-increasing effect of greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emission on global warming and environmental stability are two international problem with major technical , economic and political implication in the 21st century . Therefore , it is urgent to restructure present energy production and utilization system in order to ensure that fossil fuel are used with high efficiency and low to zero emission . Polygeneration energy system combine power generation and chemical fuel synthesis in a single plant ( producing both electricity and fuel ) and thus provide a promising alternative pathway towards achieving sustainable and flexible economic development . Mixed-Integer programming ( MIP ) is useful in constructing long-term decision model that are suitable for investment planning and design of polygeneration infrastructure system . This paper present a model for the investment planning of a polygeneration energy system and a case study addressing a system for production of methanol and electricity in China during the period from 2010 to 2035 . It contains five different feedstock and twelve polygeneration technology . ( C ) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All right reserved .

aVWe examined the vulnerability of 34 specie of oak ( Quercus ) and pine ( Pinus ) to the effect of global climate change in Mexico . We regionalized the HadCM2 model of climate change with local climatic data ( mean annual temperature and rainfall ) and downscaled the model with the inverse distance-weighted method . Databases of herbarium specimen , genetic algorithm ( GARP ) , and digital cover of biophysical variable that affect oak and pine were used to project geographic distribution of the specie under a severe and conservative scenario of climate change for the year 2050 . Starting with the current average temperature of 20.2 degree C and average precipitation of 793 mm , under the severe warming scenario mean temperature and precipitation changed to 22.7 degree C and 660 mm , respectively , in 2050 . For the conservative warming scenario , these variable shifted to 21.8 degree C and 721 mm . Responses to the different scenario of climate change were predicted to be species-specific and related to each specie climate affinity . The current geographic distribution of oak and pine decreased 7-48 % and 0.2-64 % , respectively . The more vulnerable pine were Pinus rudis , P. chihuahuana , P. oocarpa , and P. culminicola , and the most vulnerable oak were Quercus crispipilis , Q. peduncularis , Q. acutifolia , and Q. sideroxyla . In addition to habitat conservation , we think sensitive pine and oak specie should be looked at more closely to define ex situ strategy ( i.e. , seed preservation in germplasm bank ) for their long-term conservation . Modeling climatic-change scenario is important to the development of conservation strategy .

aVDeveloping country ' energy use is rapidly increasing , which affect global climate change and global and regional energy setting . Energy model are helpful for exploring the future of developing and industrialised country . However , energy system of developing country differ from those of industrialised country , which ha consequence for energy modelling . New requirement need to be met by present-day energy model to adequately explore the future of developing country ' energy system . This paper aim to ass if the main characteristic of developing country are adequately incorporated in present-day energy model . We first discus these main characteristic , focusing particularly on developing Asia , and then present a model comparison of 12 selected energy model to test their suitability for developing country . We conclude that many model are biased towards industrialised country , neglecting main characteristic of developing country , e.g . the informal economy , supply shortage , poor performance of the power sector , structural economic change , electrification , traditional bio-fuels , urban-rural divide . To more adequately address the energy system of developing country , energy model have to be adjusted and new model have to be built . We therefore indicate how to improve energy model for increasing their suitability for developing country and give advice on modelling technique and data requirement . ( c ) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

aVDespite their economic and environmental impact , there have been relatively few attempt to model the distribution of invasive ant specie . In this study , the potential distribution of six invasive ant specie in New Zealand are modelled using three fundamentally different method ( BIOCLIM , DOMAIN , MAXENT ) . Species record were obtained from museum collection in New Zealand . There wa a significant relationship between the length of time an exotic specie had been present in New Zealand and it geographic range . This is the first time such a time lag ha been described for exotic ant specie , and show there is a considerable time lag in their spread . For example , it ha taken many specie several decade ( 40-60 year ) to obtain a distribution of 17-25 % of New Zealand region . For all six specie , BIOCLIM performed poorly compared to the other two modelling method . BIOCLIM had lower AUC score and higher omission error , suggesting BIOCLIM model under-predicted the potential distribution of each specie . Omission error wa significantly higher between model fitted with all 19 climate variable compared to those model with fewer climate variable for BIOCLIM , but not DOMAIN or MAXENT . Widespread specie had a greater commission error . A number of region in New Zealand are predicted to be climatically suitable for the six specie modelled , particularly coastal and lowland area of both the North and South Islands .

aVDuring recent reinvestigations in the Great Cave of Niah in Borneo , the 'Hell Trench ' sedimentary sequence seen by earlier excavator wa re-exposed . Early excavation here yielded the earliest anatomically-modern human remains in island Southeast Asia . Calibrated radiocarbon date , pollen , algal microfossil , palynofacies , granulometry and geochemistry of the 'Hell Trench ' sequence provide information about environmental and vegetational change , element of geomorphic history and information about human activity . The 'Hell ' sediment were laid down episodically in an ephemeral stream or pool . The pollen suggests cyclically changing vegetation with forest habitat alternating with more open environment ; indicating that phase with both temperature and precipitation reduced compared with the present . These event can be correlated with global climate change sequence to produce a provisional dating framework . During some forest phase , high count of Justicia , a plant which today colonises recently burnt forest area , point to fire in the landscape . This may be evidence for biomass burning by human , presumably to maintain forest-edge habitat . There is evidence from palynofacies for fire on the cave floor in the 'Hell ' area . Since the area sampled is beyond the limit of plant growth , this is evidence for human activity . The first such evidence is during an episode with significant grassland indicator , suggesting that people may have reached the site during a climatic phase characterised by relatively open habitat similar to 50 ka . Thereafter , people were able to maintain a relatively consistent presence at Niah . The human use of the 'Hell ' area seems to have intensified through time , probably because change in the local hydrological regime made the area dryer and more suitable for human use .

aVThe termination of the last ice age ( Termination 1 ; T I ) is crucial for our understanding of global climate change and for the validation of climate model . There are still a number of open question regarding for example the exact timing and the mechanism involved in the initiation of deglaciation and the subsequent interhemispheric pattern of the warming . Our study is based on a well-dated and high-resolution alkenone-based sea surface temperature ( SST ) record from the SE-Pacific off southern Chile ( Ocean Drilling Project Site 1233 ) showing that deglacial warming at the northern margin of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current system ( ACC ) began shortly after 19,000 year BP ( 19 kyr BP ) . The timing is largely consistent with Antarctic ice-core record but the initial warming in the SE-Pacific is more abrupt suggesting a direct and immediate response to the slowdown of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation through the bipolar seesaw mechanism . This response requires a rapid transfer of the Atlantic signal to the SE-Pacific without involving the thermal inertia of the Southern Ocean that may contribute to the substantially more gradual deglacial temperature rise seen in Antarctic ice-cores . A very plausible mechanism for this rapid transfer is a seesaw-induced change of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system of the ACC and the southern westerly wind belt . In addition , modelling result suggest that insolation change and the deglacial CO ( 2 ) rise induced a substantial SST increase at our site location but with a gradual warming structure . The similarity of the two-step rise in our proxy SSTs and CO ( 2 ) over T I strongly demand for a forcing mechanism influencing both , temperature and CO ( 2 ) . As SSTs at our coring site are particularly sensitive to latitudinal shift of the ACC/southern westerly wind belt system , we conclude that such latitudinal shift may substantially affect the upwelling of deepwater mass in the Southern Ocean and thus the release Of CO ( 2 ) to the atmosphere a suggested by the conceptual model of [ Toggweiler , JR. , Rusell , J.L. , Carson , S.R. , 2006 . Midlatitude westerly , atmospheric CO ( 2 ) , and climate change during ice age . Paleoceanography 21. doi : 10 . 1029/2005PA001154 ] . ( c ) 2007 Elsevier B.V.. All right reserved .

aVThe Kenya rift valley is the classic example of an active continental rift zone . We report the rift flank cooling history based on a combination of previous apatite fission track ( AFT ) and new ( U-Th ) /He ( AIIe ) data . Our result corroborate the Late Cretaceous rapid cooling episode of continent-wide significance revealed previously by AFT dating . Post-Cretaceous cooling of the eastern rift flank wa slow with net cooling of 3400 m in central Kenya . This timing also largely coincides with the uplift of the Western Rift flank in Uganda and Congo and with the change toward drier condition and grassland-dominated vegetation in East Africa . We propose that the regional morphotectonic evolution of the Kenyan rift flank contributed to late Cenozoic environmental change in East Africa , thus superimposing a pronounced local effect on global climate change at that time .

aVIt is generally assumed that region glaciated by continental ice sheet offer little promise for long paleoenvironmental record due to erosional process associated with glaciation . We show that beneath portion of the northeastern Laurentide Ice Sheet , characterized by cold-based glaciation , sediment sequence representing multiple interglaciations have been preserved within extant lake basin . Radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence dating confirm the antiquity of the sediment , thereby extending the terrestrial paleoenvironmental record of the Canadian Arctic by hundred of thousand of year . The lake sediment record presented here corroborates numerous recent cosmogenic exposure dating study indicating complex pattern of erosion beneath polar ice sheet . It also demonstrates that the presence of intact interglacial sediment doe not demand unglaciated refugia . Similarly ancient sediment may be preserved in many region formerly covered by Pleistocene ice sheet .

aVThe terrestrial carbon cycle is one of the focus in global climate change research . Simulating net primary productivity ( NPP ) of terrestrial ecosystem is important for carbon cycle research . In this study , China 's terrestrial NPP wa simulated using the Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator ( BEPS ) , a carbon-water coupled process model based on remote sensing input . For these purpose , a national-wide database ( including leaf area index , land cover , meteorology , vegetation and soil ) at a I km resolution and a validation database were established . Using these database and BEPS , daily map of NPP for the entire China 's landmass in 2001 were produced , and gross primary productivity ( GPP ) and autotrophic respiration ( RA ) were estimated . Using the simulated result , we explore temporal-spatial pattern of China 's terrestrial NPP and the mechanism of it response to various environmental factor . The total NPP and mean NPP of China 's landmass were 2.235GtC and 235.2gCm ( -2 ) yr ( -1 ) , respectively ; the total GPP and mean GPP were 4.418 GtC and 465 gCm m ( -2 ) yr ( -1 ) 1 ; and the total RA and mean RA were 2.227 GtC and 234 gC m-2 yr-1 , respectively . On average , NPP wa 50.6 % of GPP . In addition , statistical analysis of NPP of different land cover type wa conducted , and spatiotemporal pattern of NPP were investigated . The response of NPP to change in some key factor such a LAI , precipitation , temperature , solar radiation , VPD and AWC are evaluated and discussed . ( C ) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVNewly discovered specimen of alagomyids , mostly isolated teeth collected by screenwashing at the Gashatan ( Late Paleocene ) Subeng locality in Inner Mongolia , document considerable intraspecific variation in Tribosphenomys minutus that ha not been appreciated previously because of limited sample size . P4s of Tribosphenomys are described for the first time , which help to clarify the posterior premolar identification of alagomyids . Some of the alagomyid specimen are referred to Tribosphenomys cf . T secundus and Neimengomys qii gen. and sp . nov. Based on the new data , Tribosphenomys borealis from the Bumban Member of the Naran Bulak Formation , Mongolia , is considered to be a junior synonym of Alagomys inopinatus , and T tertius from the Zhigden Member of the Naran Bulak Formation is regarded a a junior synonym of T minutus . Alagomyidae , consisting of Tribosphenomys , Alagomys and Neimengomys , is maintained a a valid family . The presence of a diversity of alagomyids and other recently obtained fossil and stratigraphic evidence from the Erlian Basin suggest that the Gashatan and Bumbanian of Asia are probably correlative to the late Tiffanian-early Wasachian of North America . The faunal turnover during the Gashatan and Bumbanian in Asia is probably related to the Late Paleocene-Early Eocene global warming , but current evidence is insufficient to link any specific event with the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum .

aVThis study investigated the current distribution of an invasive tropical fern , Thelypteris dentata , and it habitat type in three Japanese prefecture ( Osaka , Kyoto , and Shiga ) in the Kinki District . The result showed that T. dentata ha expanded it distribution into highly urbanized area in Osaka Prefecture and ha reached southern Kyoto Prefecture and central Shiga Prefecture . The distribution of T. dentata population thus seems to have expanded northward based on comparison with the distribution that wa determined in the 1980s . Because the fern 's habitat type were mainly the side wall or bottom of drainage channel , crevice in stone wall and roadside , the urban matrix ha not served a a barrier to the expansion of the range of T. dentata ; on the contrary , it may be serving a a type of heat island corridor that is facilitating the spread of this specie .

aVGlobal oceanic deposit of methane gas hydrate ( clathrate ) have been implicated a the main culprit for a repeated , remarkably rapid sequence of global warming effect that occurred during the late Quaternary period . However , the behavior of contemporary oceanic methane hydrate deposit subjected to rapid temperature change , like those predicted under future climate change scenario , is poorly understood , and existing study focus on deep hydrate deposit under equilibrium condition . In this study , we simulate the dynamic response of several type of oceanic gas hydrate accumulation to temperature change at the seafloor and ass the potential for methane release into the ecosystem . The result suggest that while many deep hydrate deposit are indeed stable under the influence of rapid seafloor temperature variation , shallow deposit , such a those found in arctic region or in the Gulf of Mexico , can undergo rapid dissociation and produce significant carbon flux over a period of decade .

aVDetermining trend and implementing detrending operation are important step in data analysis . Yet there is no precise definition of `` trend '' nor any logical algorithm for extracting it . As a result , various ad hoc extrinsic method have been used to determine trend and to facilitate a detrending operation . In this article , a simple and logical definition of trend is given for any nonlinear and nonstationary time series a an intrinsically determined monotonic function within a certain temporal span ( most often that of the data span ) , or a function in which there can be at most one extremum within that temporal span . Being intrinsic , the method to derive the trend ha to be adaptive . This definition of trend also presumes the existence of a natural time scale . All these requirement suggest the Empirical Mode Decomposition ( EMD ) method a the logical choice of algorithm for extracting various trend from a data set . Once the trend is determined , the corresponding detrending operation can be implemented . With this definition of trend , the variability of the data on various time scale also can be derived naturally . Climate data are used to illustrate the determination of the intrinsic trend and natural variability .

aVThe Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change ( IPCC ) analyzing global climate change tendency and their possible impact on the natural environment and human lifestyle ha determined that the ocean and sea level fluctuation are among the indicator of climate change . Annual variation of hydrometeorological condition were found to have been predetermined not by a steady increase or decrease of one parameter but by their variation within season . Therefore the present paper deal with the long-term seasonal Baltic Sea level fluctuation near the Lithuanian coast . Mean monthly value of sea level measured in the port of Klaipeda were chosen for detailed analysis of sea level fluctuation in the Baltic Sea . The long-term dynamic pattern of mean sea level fluctuation near Klaipeda includes two time span distinguished by pronounced difference of sea level rise intensity : 1898-1975 and 1976-2005 . The 51-year time span for a detailed analysis of long-term seasonal sea level fluctuation ( 1955-2005 ) wa chosen purposefully because it best reflects the change of sea level rise intensity . The analysis of long-term seasonal sea level fluctuation revealed cyclic character . Yet the monthly cycle phase not always coincide . Also it wa determined that the character of maximal mean monthly sea level dynamic in cold season had changed . Generalized comparative analysis of monthly sea level dynamic and climate variation showed that the sea level dynamic wa a good reflection of the climate change in cold season ( October-March ) , whereas in warm season ( April-September ) , sea level fluctuation were not so well reflected in climate change .

aVGlobal climate change is likely to alter the phenological pattern of plant due to the controlling effect of climate on plant ontogeny , especially in an urbanized environment . We studied relationship between various phenophases ( i.e. , seasonal biological event ) and interannual variation of air temperature in three woody plant specie ( Prunus davidiana , Hibiscus syriacus , and Cercis chinensis ) in the Beijing Metropolis , China , based on phenological data for the period 1962-2004 and meteorological data for the period 1951-2004 . Analysis of phenology and climate data indicated significant change in spring and autumn phenophases and temperature . Changes in phenophases were observed for all the three specie , consistent with pattern of rising air temperature in the Beijing Metropolis . The changing phenology in the three plant specie wa reflected mainly a advance of the spring phenophases and delay in the autumn phenophases , but with strong variation among specie and phenophases in response to different temperature index . Most phenophases ( both spring and autumn phenophases ) had significant relationship with temperature of the preceding month . There existed large inter- and intra-specific variation , however , in the response of phenology to climate change . It is clear that the urban heat island effect from 1978 onwards is a dominant cause of the observed phenological change . Differences in phenological response to climate change may cause uncertain ecological consequence , with implication for ecosystem stability and function in urban environment .

aVGlobal temperature ha been increased by 0.6 degree C over the past century and is predicted to increase by 1.4-5.8 degree C by the end of this century . It is unclear what impact global warming will have on tallgrass specie . In the present study , we examined leaf net photosynthetic rate ( P-n ) and leaf respiration rate in darkness ( R-d ) of Aster ericoides ( L. ) Nesom , Ambrosia psilostachya DC. , Helianthus mollis Lam. , and Sorghastrum nutans ( L. ) Nash in response to experimental warming in a taligrass prairie ecosystem of the Great Plains , USA , in the autumn ( fall ) of 2000 and through 2001 . Warming ha been implemented with infrared heater since 21 November 1999 . The P-n increased significantly in spring , decreased in early fall , and did not change in summer and late fall in the four specie under warming compared with control . The R-d of the four specie increased significantly until mid-summer and then did not change under warming . Measured temperature-response curve of P-n showed that warming increased the optimum temperature of P-n ( T-opt ) by 2.32 and 4.59 degree C for H. mollis and S. nutans , respectively , in August , whereas there were no change in May and September , and A. ericoides and A. psilostachya also showed no change in any of the 3 month . However , P-n at optimum temperature ( P-opt ) showed downregulation in September and no regulation in May and August for all four specie . The temperature-response curve of R-d illustrate that the temperature sensitivity of R-d , Q ( 10 ) , wa lower in the warmed plot compared with the control plot , except for A. ericoides in August , whereas there were no change in May and September for all four specie . The result of the present study indicate that photosynthetic and respiratory acclimation varies with specie and among season , occurring in the mid-growing season and not in the early and late growing season .

aV1 . The consequence of global warming and change in resource availability were investigated in subalpine grassland in the Pyrenees . These community are considered to be especially vulnerable to climate change because of their position at the south-western edge of the semi-natural grassland biome in Europe . 2 . Changes in pattern of above- and below-ground biomass were assessed for different plant guild in two experiment , in which turf were transplanted from upland to lowland location . The first experiment aimed to evaluate general response to warming and drought , and the second to disentangle the effect of possible underlying mechanism through resource manipulation by mean of a nitrogen x phosphorus fertilization experiment . 3 . The increased above-ground biomass in grassland turf transplanted to lowland suggested that biomass production wa more temperature-limited than water-limited . The enhancement effect found in the upland turf following phosphorus addition supported the hypothesis of a strong limitation arising from reduced nutrient availability , confirming the central role played by phosphorus in these grassland and it potential importance in the response to global change . 4 . Nitrogen addition did not stimulate total biomass but affected guild composition . Grasses dominated the upland and at high resource level , while forbs dominated the lowland and when water and nutrient decreased . The counterintuitive effect of increased biomass with decreased water in the lowland wa related to shift in dominance from grass to forbs , probably enabled by decreased nutrient availability under drought condition . 5 . Synthesis and application . Environmental factor interacted in complex way , producing change in biomass distribution and guild proportion in subalpine grassland . In addition , the result suggested that the capability of high-altitude grassland to provide quality forage in summer time could be threatened in the northern Mediterranean region under climate change condition because of : ( i ) a decrease in their reliability a a result of complex biomass interaction with temperature , water and nutrient dynamic ; ( ii ) expected feedback mechanism ; and ( iii ) compositional shift .

aVPlasma kinetics of silicon dioxide plasma cleaning is investigated with C2F6 and CF3CF2OCF=CF2 ( perfluoroethyl vinyl ether , PEVE ) in this work . Perfluorocompounds ( PFCs ) are widely used in the semiconductor industry , and they are known to have long atmospheric lifetime and high global warming potential ( GWP ) due to their chemical stability and large cross section for infrared radiation absorption . The silicon dioxide ( SiO2 ) cleaning process in a plasmaenhanced chemical vapor deposition ( PECVD ) chamber is known to be the largest PFC emission source for the semiconductor industry . Silicon-dioxide removal rate by surface reaction in plasma were measured in the temperature range from room temperature to 400 degree C by using laser interferometry , and the fluorine density wa determined by using an optical emission spectroscopy ( OES ) actinometry technique . The ion density and the ion energy were determined by using an impedance analysis and an equivalent circuit model . The activation energy wa determined from Arrehenius plot to be 0.163 eV and 0.169 eV for C2F6 and PEVE plasma , respectively , in the PECVD chamber cleaning condition . It is shown here that silicon-dioxide removal rate is linearly proportional to the fluorine concentration for the PECVD chamber cleaning condition of 300 400 degree C and that the removal rate depends on the ion flux and the ion energy below 100 degree C. The combined etch rate model is suggested to explain this temperature dependence in this work . From this plasma kinetic study , we can conclude that the atomic fluorine concentration is the dominant factor in silicon-dioxide removal for the PECVD chamber cleaning condition .

aVAlthough Antarctica is still considered a one of the most pristine area of the world , the growing tourist and fishery activity a well a scientific operation and their related logistic support are responsible for an increasing level of pollutant in this fragile environment . Soils and coastal sediment are significantly affected near scientific station particularly by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( PAHs ) . In this work sediment and soil were sampled in two consecutive summer Antarctic expedition at Potter Cove and peninsula , in the vicinity of Jubany Station ( South Shetland Islands ) . Two- and 3-ring PAHs ( methylnaphthalene , fluorene , phenanthrene and anthracene ) were the main compound found in most site , although total PAH concentration showed relatively low level compared with other human-impacted area in Antarctica . Pattern distribution of PAHs observed in sample suggested that low-temperature combustion process such a diesel motor combustion and open-field garbage burning are the main source of these compound . An increase in PAH concentration wa observed from surface to depth into the active soil layer except for a unique sampling site where a fuel spill had been recently reported and where an inverted PAH concentration gradient wa observed . The highest level wa detected in the upper layer of permafrost followed by a sharp decrease in depth , showing this layer is acting a a barrier for downward PAH migration . When PAH level in soil from both sampling program were compared a significant decrease ( p < 0.01 ) wa observed in summer 2005 ( range at 75-cm depth : 12 +/- 1-153 +/- 22 ng/g ) compared to summer 2004 ( range at 75-cm depth : 162 +/- 15-1182 +/- 113 ng/g ) whereas concentration in surface sediment collected nearby the station PAHs increased drastically in 2005 ( range : 36 +/- 3-1908 +/- 114 ng/g ) compared to 2004 ( range : 28 +/- 3-312 +/- 24 ng/g ) . Precipitation regime and water run off suggest that an important wash out of soil-PAHs occurred during the interval time between sampling . Results showed that the present PAH contamination level of Jubany Station is relatively low compared to other reported case in Antarctica but also suggests that an increase in rain and in thawing process caused by the global warming could result in an important soil-associated PAH mobilization with unpredictable consequence for the biota of Potter Cove .

aVA high temporal resolution pollen diagram from a lake in the mid-Arctic region of the Boothia Peninsula , Nunavut , Canada , document the history of the regional vegetation and climate for the past 7200 yr. Major tundra pollen taxon in the core include Cyperaceae and Salix , with Cyperaceae comprising over 50 % of the pollen in the early and late Holocene . Tree pollen , transported from far to the south , comprised a large percentage of the pollen sum , with Pinus accounting for 30 % of the pollen in some level of the core . Pollen percentage and concentration of taxon typical of the mid-Arctic were highest in the mid-Holocene , corresponding to warm condition . Decreasing pollen concentration indicate cooling temperature , with more rapid decrease occurring around 4200 , 3800-3400 , and 2500 cal yr BP . Pollen percentage of Salix , Cyperaceae , and Artemisia increased in the past 35 yr in response to global warming . Reconstructions of July temperature using the modem analog technique showed that the mid-Holocene ( 5800-2800 cal yr BP ) wa approximately 1 degree C higher than during the past 1000 yr.

aVAn analysis of the elevational distribution of Southeast Asian bird over a 28-year period provides evidence for a potential upward shift for 94 common resident specie . These specie might have shifted their lower , upper , or both lower and upper boundary toward a higher elevation in response to climate warming . These upward shift occurred regardless of habitat specificity , further implicating climate warming , in addition to habitat loss , a a potentially important factor affecting the already imperiled biota of Southeast Asia .

aVProjected temperature increase under global warming could benefit southern tree specie by providing them the optimal growing temperature and could be detrimental to northern specie by exposing them to the supra optimal growing temperature . This benefit-detriment trade-off could increase the competitive advantage of southern specie in the northern specie range and cause the increase or even dominance of southern specie in the northern domain . However , the optimum temperature for photosynthesis of C3 plant may increase due to CO ( 2 ) enrichment . An increase in the optimum temperature could greatly reduce the benefit-detriment effect . In this study , we coupled a forest ecosystem process model ( PnET-II ) and a forest GAP model ( LINKAGES ) with a spatially dynamic forest landscape model ( LANDIS-II ) to study how an optimum temperature increase could affect forest landscape response due to global warming . We simulated 360 year of forest landscape change in the Boundary Water Canoe Area ( BWCA ) in northern Minnesota , which is transitional between boreal and temperate forest . Our result showed that , under the control scenario of continuing the historic 1984-1993 mean climate ( mainly temperature , precipitation and CO ( 2 ) ) , the BWCA will become a spruce-fir dominated boreal forest . However , under the scenario of predicted climatic change [ the 2000-2099 climate are predicted by Canadian Climate Center ( CCC ) , followed by 200 year of continuing the predicted 2090-2099 mean climate ] , the BWCA will become a pine-dominated mixed forest . If the optimum temperature increase gradually with [ CO ( 2 ) ] ( the increase in optimum temperature is assumed to change gradually from O degree C in year 2000 to 5 degree C in year 2099 when [ CO ( 2 ) ] reach 711ppm and stabilizes at 5 degree C after year 2099 ) , the BWCA would remain a fir-dominated boreal forest in area with relatively high water-holding capacity , but not in area with relatively low water-holding capacity . Our result suggest that the [ CO ( 2 ) ] induced increase in optimum temperature could substantially reduce forest landscape change caused by global warming . However , not all tree specie would be able to successfully adapt to future warming a predicted by CCC , regardless of optimum temperature acclimation .

aVDiminishing fossil fuel reserve and growing concern about global warming indicate that sustainable source of energy are needed in the near future . For fuel to be useful in the transportation sector , they must have specific physical property that allow for efficient distribution , storage and combustion ; these property are currently fulfilled by non-renewable petroleum-derived liquid fuel . Ethanol , the only renewable liquid fuel currently produced in large quantity , suffers from several limitation , including low energy density , high volatility , and contamination by the absorption of water from the atmosphere . Here we present a catalytic strategy for the production of 2,5-dimethylfuran from fructose ( a carbohydrate obtained directly from biomass or by the isomerization of glucose ) for use a a liquid transportation fuel . Compared to ethanol , 2,5-dimethylfuran ha a higher energy density ( by 40 per cent ) , a higher boiling point ( by 20 K ) , and is not soluble in water . This catalytic strategy creates a route for transforming abundant renewable biomass resource ( 1,2 ) into a liquid fuel suitable for the transportation sector , and may diminish our reliance on petroleum .

aVProteomic analysis provides a powerful method for studying plant response to stress at the protein level . To study stress-responsive molecular mechanism for Pinus armandii Franch , one of the most important forest plantation tree specie in subalpine region of Asia , we analyzed the response of 2-year-old P. armandii seedling to drought and high temperature using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis . More than 550 reproducible needle protein were detected in the control and treatment , and the abundance of 27 protein were found to change noticeably . We identified five protein affected by drought stress and eight protein affected by high temperature . These protein are functionally quite diverse and are involved in photosynthesis , cell division and elongation , antioxidant metabolism , ammonia assimilation , growth and development , and protein folding . Our result provide fundamental data for future research on response to drought and high temperature . As drought and high temperature are two major factor limiting the growth of subalpine forest during summer under recent global warming , this research may contribute to an understanding of the development of stress tolerance in tree .

aVConcerns about the impact of hydrocarbon use on climate and global warming are significantly growing . Furthermore , we are all well aware that security of supply is increasingly an issue . In this context , it is now principally recognised that nuclear energy ha to be back on the agenda . All in all , the prospect for the nuclear power industry and thus for the uranium activity is very positive for the coming year . The change that have taken place in the international uranium market during the past several year are remarkable . Since 2002 , the uranium price have increased more than tenfold . The spot market price of uranium began an increase from about USD 9/lb U3O8 in mid 2001 following a fire at the Olympic Dam mill ( Australia ) in October 2001 and wa propelled in subsequent year by a series of interrupting event , such a the mine shaft flooding at the McArthur River mine ( Canada ) in April 2003 , the threat of the early shutdown of the Rossing mine ( Namibia ) and the Ranger mine ( Australia ) in 2003 , the decision of Techsnabexport ( Tenex , Russia ) in October 2003 to terminate sale of UF6 to the US trading company Globe Nuclear Services and Supply GNSS Ltd. ( GNSS ) , and finally the complete flooding at the developing Cigar Lake mine ( Canada ) in October 2006 . With the emergence of hedge fund and investor , that began in late 2004 , increased uranium demand and upward pressure on market price were further stimulated . What about the recent event and trend in the uranium industry ? Are the uranium producer and the utility well prepared to meet all the challenge associated with development in the uranium business ? And what about the risk , uncertainty and other factor that could affect the development in the uranium industry and uranium market ? .

aVAs a consequence of global warming and an enhanced water cycle , the climate changed in northwest China , most notably in the Xinjiang area in the year 1987 . Precipitation , glacial melt water and river runoff and air temperature increased continuously during the last decade , a did also the water level of inland lake and the frequency of flood disaster . As a result , the vegetation cover is improved , number of day with sand-dust storm reduced . From the end of the 19th century to the 1970s , the climate wa warm and dry , and then changed to warm and wet . The effect on northwest China can be classified into three class by using the relation between precipitation and evaporation increase . If precipitation increase more than evaporation , runoff increase and lake water level rise . We identify region with : ( 1 ) notable change , ( 2 ) slight change and ( 3 ) no change . The future climate for doubled CO2 concentration is simulated in a nested approach with the regional climate model-RegCM2 . The annual temperature will increase by 2.7 degree C and annual precipitation by 25 % . The cooling effect of aerosol and natural factor will reduce this increase to 2.0 degree C and 19 % of precipitation . As a consequence , annual runoff may increase by more than 10 % .

aVWith mounting evidence that global warming is taking place , the cause of this warming ha come under vigorous scrutiny . Recent study have lead to a debate over what contributes the most to regional temperature change . We investigated air temperature pattern in California from 1950 to 2000 . Statistical analysis were used to test the significance of temperature trend in California subregions in an attempt to clarify the spatial and temporal pattern of the occurrence and intensity of warming . Most region showed a stronger increase in minimum temperature than with mean and maximum temperature . Areas of intensive urbanization showed the largest positive trend , while rural , non-agricultural region showed the least warming . Strong correlation between temperature and Pacific sea surface temperature ( SSTs ) particularly Pacific Decadal Oscillation ( PDO ) value , also account for temperature variability throughout the state . The analysis of 331 state weather station associated a number of factor with temperature trend , including urbanization , population , Pacific oceanic condition and elevation . Using climatic division mean temperature trend , the state had an average warming of 0.99 degree C ( 1.79 degree F ) over the 1950-2000 period , or 0.20 degree C ( 0.36 degree F ) decade . Southern California had the highest rate of warming , while the NE Interior Basins division experienced cooling . Large urban site showed rate over twice those for the state , for the mean maximum temperature , and over 5 time the state 's mean rate for the minimum temperature . In comparison , irrigated cropland site warmed about 0.13 degree C decade ( -1 ) annually , but near 0.40 degree C for summer and fall minimum . Offshore Pacific SSTs warmed 0.09 degree C decade ( -1 ) for the study period .

aVOrganisms are responding to recent climate warming by changing different aspect of their biology , including morphology . The present work examines the way in which dipper ( Cinclus cinclus ) morphology ha varied over the past 20 year ( 1985-2005 ) in Sierra Nevada ( south-eastern Spain ) . Tarsus length ha decreased , but wing and tail length have increased in the same period . These opposite trend have provoked change in the allometric relationship among the different part of the body in the dipper . A decrease in body size is predicted by Bergmann 's rule , and similar result have been found in other bird . However , although this study found a decrease in tarsus length , no change wa found for body mass . The increase in wing and tail length may be related to a variation in the trophic niche in response to the decrease in water volume of river that occurred during the study period . Other study show that the dipper 's diet varies with water flow , and water flow ha decreased in the study area a a consequence of climatic warming .

aVWe present evidence of a recent drying in the eastern Mediterranean , based on weather and tree-ring data for Samos , an island of the eastern Aegean Sea . Rainfall declined rapidly after the late 1970s following trend for the entire Mediterranean and wa associated with reduced tree-ring width in Pinus brutia . The most recent decline led to the lowest annual radial stem increment after the last 100 year ( a far a record reach ) . As moisture availability decreased best correlation of tree growth with rainfall were obtained for progressively longer integration period ( 1-2 year in moister period , 5-6 year during the severe dryness of 20th century 's last decade ) , suggesting increasing dependency in deep soil water . Such long-term integration period of tree-growth response to precipitation have not been reported before . They may reflect a tree-rooting pattern adapted to cope with even several successive dry year . In late summer 2000 , moisture reserve became exhausted , however , and a substantial fraction of low altitude pine died , including some 80-year-old tree , which underline the exceptional extent this trend had reached . Our finding provide empirical support for Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projection derived from global circulation model that the Mediterranean , it eastern basin in particular , should become drier a temperature rise , a wa the case in the recent past .

aV1 . As a result of global warming , specie may spread into previously cool region . Species that disperse faster than their natural enemy may become released from top-down control . We investigated whether plant originating from southern Europe and recently established in north-western Europe experience le soil pathogen effect than native specie . 2 . We selected three plant specie originating from southern Europe that have immigrated into the Netherlands and three similar native Dutch specie . All six plant specie were grown in sterilized soil with a soil inoculum collected from the rhizospheres of field population . As a control we grew a series of all six plant specie with a sterilized rhizosphere inoculum . 3 . We harvested the plant , added the conditioned soil to sterilized soil and grew a second generation of all six plant specie in order to test for each plant pair feedback effect from the conditioned soil community to conspecific and heterospecifics . 4 . The effect of the soil community is dependent on plant specie , and is dependent on soil fertility in only one of the three pair . 5 . Soil conditioning caused le biomass reduction to exotic plant specie than to native specie , suggesting that exotic immigrant are le exposed to soil pathogen than similar native plant specie . 6 . Our result suggest that plant specie that expand their range a a result of climate change may become released from soil pathogenic activity . Whether the exotics are released from soil pathogen , or whether they experience enhanced benefit from mutualistic symbionts remains to be studied . We conclude that range expansion may result in enemy release pattern that are similar to artificially introduced invasive exotic plant specie . 7 . The escape from enemy through range shift change key biotic interaction and complicates prediction of future distribution and dominance .

aVHuman-induced global warming ha significantly increased the importance of satellite monitoring of land surface temperature ( LST ) on a global scale . The MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) provides a 1-km resolution LST product with almost daily coverage of the Earth , invaluable to both local and global change study . The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission Reflection Radiometer ( ASTER ) provides a LST product with a high spatial resolution of 90-m and a 16-day recurrent cycle , simultaneously acquired at the same height and nadir view a MODIS . ASTER and MODIS are complementary in resolution , offering a unique opportunity for scale-related study . ASTER and MODIS LST have been widely used but the error in LST were mostly disregarded . Correction of ASTER-to-MODIS LST discrepancy is essential for study reliant upon the joint use of these sensor . In this study , we compared three correction approach : the Wan et al . 's approach , the refined Wan et al . 's approach , and the generalized split window ( GSW ) algorithm based approach . The Wan et al . 's approach corrects the MODIS 1-km LST using MODIS 5-km LST . The refined approach modifies the Wan et al . 's approach through incorporating ASTER emissivity and MODIS 5-km data . The GSW algorithm approach doe not use MODIS 5-km but only ASTER emissivity data . We examined the case over a semi-arid terrain area for the part of the Loess Plateau of China . All the approach reduced the ASTER-to-MODIS LST discrepancy effectively . With terrain correction , the original ASTER-to-MODIS LST difference reduced from 2.7 +/- 1.28 K to -0.1 +/- 1.87 K for the Wan et al . 's approach , 0.2 +/- 1.57 K for the refined approach , and 0.1 +/- 1.33 K for the GSW algorithm based approach . Among all the approach , the GSW algorithm based approach performed best in term of mean , standard deviation , root mean square root , and correlation coefficient .

aVThe Inner Mongolia grassland of China is representative of semi-arid grassland in temperate zone . Studying land surface process in this region will improve the understanding of regional climate formation and the feedback with global climate change . Satellite remote sensing provides an excellent opportunity to study land-atmosphere interaction at the regional scale . It is necessary to develop feasible and reasonable remote sensing-based method to map surface energy flux for a specific study area . In this paper , previously published algorithm and empirical formula were tested with Landsat 7 ETM+ data to derive the regional distribution of land surface reflectance , surface temperature , NDVI and land surface energy flux ( net radiation , soil heat flux , sensible heat flux and latent heat flux ) over the upper Xilin River watershed in Inner Mongolia , China . A new land use/land cover classification wa developed and applied for regionalization analysis . Validation of remote sensing derived surface reflectance , surface temperature , net radiation and sensible heat flux with field measurement show difference of about 13 , 4 , 1 , and 28 % , respectively . This study provides valuable guidance for further investigation of the whole watershed .

aVThe data of 160 national meteorological observatory ( NMO ) station with long-term monthly temperature data for China were analyzed in this study to show the basin-centered summer temperature decrease against global warming in the past half century . The summer and winter isotherm structure Of 1950s and 1990s worked out by interpolation show the isotherm structure variation : the isotherm structure generally move northward in winter , but in summer it is characterized with separate high-temperature and low-temperature center and the isotherm structure move inward the center with global warming , indicating that the temperature in the highland area increase but that in the lowland area decrease in the summer of the duration . The possible mechanism of the basin-centered temperature decrease in summer is discussed in this paper .

aVThe frequency of moderate to heavy rainfall event is projected to change in response to global warming . Here we show that these hydrologic change may have a profound effect on mosquito population dynamic and rate of mosquito-borne disease transmission . We develop a simple model , which treat the mosquito reproductive cycle a a phase oscillator that responds to rainfall frequency forcing . This model reproduces observed mosquito population dynamic and indicates that mosquito-borne disease transmission can be sensitive to rainfall frequency . These finding indicate that change to the hydrologic cycle , in particular the frequency of moderate to heavy rainfall event , could have a profound effect on the transmission rate of some mosquito-borne disease .

aVThe importance of efficaciously assessing the risk for introduction and establishment of pest specie is an increasingly important ecological and economic issue . Evaluation of climate is fundamental to determining the potential success of an introduced or invasive insect pest . However , evaluating climatic suitability pose substantial difficulty ; climate can be measured and assessed in a bewildering array of way . Some physiological filter , in essence a lens that focus climate through the requirement and constraint of a potential pest introduction , is required . Difficulties in assessing climate suitability are further exacerbated by the effect of climate change . Gypsy moth ( Lymantria dispar L. ) is an exotic , tree-defoliating insect that is frequently introduced into the western United States . In spite of an abundance of potential host specie , these introduction have yet to result in established population . The success of eradication effort and the unsuccessful establishment of many detected and undetected introduction may be related to an inhospitable climate . Climatic suitability for gypsy moth in the western United States , however , is potentially improving , perhaps rapidly , due to a general warming trend that began in the mid 1970s and continues today . In this work , we describe the application of a physiologically based climate suitability model for evaluating risk of gypsy moth establishment on a landscape level . Development of this risk assessment system first required amassing database that integrated the gypsy moth climatic assessment model , with host specie distribution , and climate ( historical , present , and future ) . This integrated system wa then used to evaluate climate change scenario for native host specie in Utah , with the result that risk of establishment will dramatically increase during the remainder of the 21st century under reasonable climate change scenario . We then applied the risk assessment system to several case history of detected gypsy moth introduction in Utah . These application demonstrated the general utility of the system for predicting risk of establishment and for designing improved risk detection strategy .

aVThe paper review critical process for the landsea flux of biogenic element ( C , N , P , Si ) in the Baltic Sea catchment and discus possible future scenario a a consequence of improved sewage treatment , agricultural practice and increased hydropower demand ( for N , P and Si ) and of global warming , i.e. , change in hydrological pattern ( for C ) . These most significant driver will not only change the total amount of nutrient input and flux of organic and inorganic form of carbon to the Baltic Sea , their ratio ( C : N : P : Si ) will alter a well with consequence for phytoplankton specie composition in the Baltic Sea . In summary , we propose that N flux may increase due to higher livestock density in those country recently acceded to the EU , whereas P and Si flux may decrease due to an improved sewage treatment in these new EU member state and with further damming and still eutrophic state of many lake in the entire Baltic Sea catchment . This might eventually decrease cyanobacteria bloom in the Baltic but increase the potential for other nuisance bloom . Dinoflagellates could eventually substitute diatom that even today grow below their optimal growth condition due to low Si concentration in some region of the Baltic Sea . C flux will probably increase from the boreal part of the Baltic Sea catchment due to the expected higher temperature and heavier rainfall . However , it is not clear whether dissolved organic carbon and alkalinity , which have opposite feedback to global warming , will increase in similar amount , because the spring flow peak will be smoothed out in time due to higher temperature that cause le snow cover and deeper soil infiltration .

aVMechanisms of soil organic carbon ( C ) and nitrogen ( N ) stabilization are of great interest , due to the potential for increased CO2 release from soil organic matter ( SOM ) to the atmosphere a a result of global warming , and because of the critical role of soil organic N in controlling plant productivity . Soil protein are recognized increasingly a playing major role in stabilization and destabilization of soil organic C and N. Two category of protein are proposed : detrital protein that are released upon cell death and functional protein that are actively released into the soil to fulfill specific function . The latter include microbial surface-active protein ( e.g. , hydrophobins , chaplin , SC15 , glomalin ) , many of which have structure that promote their persistence in the soil , and extracellular enzyme , responsible for many decomposition and nutrient cycling transformation . Here we review information on the nature of soil protein , particularly those of microbial origin , and on the factor that control protein persistence and turnover in the soil . We discus first the intrinsic property of the protein molecule that affect it stability , next possible extrinsic stabilizing influence that arise a the protein interact with other soil constituent , and lastly control on accessibility of protein at coarser spatial scale involving microbial cell , clay particle , and soil aggregate . We conclude that research at the interface between soil science and microbial physiology will yield rapid advance in our understanding of soil protein . We suggest a research priority determining the relative abundance and turnover time ( age ) of microbial versus plant protein and of functional microbial protein , including surface-active compound .

aVSandy beach line most of the world 's ocean and are highly valued by society : more people use sandy beach than any other type of shore . While the economic and social value of beach are generally regarded a paramount , sandy shore also have special ecological feature and contain a distinctive biodiversity that is generally not recognized . These unique ecosystem are facing escalating anthropogenic pressure , chiefly from rapacious coastal development , direct human us - mainly associated with recreation - and rising sea level . Beaches are increasingly becoming trapped in a 'coastal squeeze ' between burgeoning human population from the land and the effect of global climate change from the sea . Society 's intervention ( e.g . shoreline armouring , beach nourishment ) to combat change in beach environment , such a erosion and shoreline retreat , can result in severe ecological impact and loss of biodiversity at local scale , but are predicted also to have cumulative large-scale consequence worldwide . Because of the scale of this problem , the continued existence of beach a functional ecosystem is likely to depend on direct conservation effort . Conservation , in turn , will have to increasingly draw on a consolidated body of ecological theory for these ecosystem . Although this body of theory ha yet to be fully developed , we identify here a number of critical research direction that are required to progress coastal management and conservation of sandy beach ecosystem .

aVPrior to the 10 ( th ) International Coral Reef Symposium in Okinawa , Japan , in June 2004 , symposium participant and member of the International Society for Reef Studies were surveyed to obtain their opinion about the major threat facing coral reef ecosystem . Responses from 286 participant were analyzed and compared to result obtained in a similar survey conducted in 1993 . Respondents tended to rank highest those threat associated with human population growth , coastal development , and overfishing . While coral bleaching wa ranked much more highly than in the 1993 survey , about two-thirds of the respondent felt that direct human impact were worse threat than those associated with global climate change .

aVThe global warming issue ha resulted in a great demand in zero emission power generation system . Recently a few new concept have been proposed that promise to achieve zero emission while delivering unprecedentedly high efficiency . In these concept , CO2 adsorbing material ( CAM ) is a key component . This paper review briefly the current development in CO2 adsorbing material , screen the potential material under the condition relevant to those in zero emission power generation system , and identifies the best candidate and the optimum operating condition for the production of high-purity hydrogen . It is found that CaO is thermodynamically the best candidate among metal oxide for CO2 capture in zero emission power generation system . There exists a region within which high-purity H-2 can be produced in steam methane reforming and carbon gasification .

aVBased on best current estimate that the world need to reduce global carbon dioxide emission by 70 % by 2050 , and that there is at best a 10-year window of opportunity available to initiate the enormous change needed , this paper proposes a set of seven self-contained step that can be taken at a global level to tackle the problem with some prospect of success . The step are self-financing and practicable , in that they are based on existing technology . They involve agreement to create a new international agency charged with formulating and policing a global carbon pricing regime ; a complementary step involving global monitoring of greenhouse gas emission utilizing satellite resource ; taking step to compensate developing country for preserving rainforest a carbon sink ; the dismantling of newly created trade barrier holding back global trade in biofuels ; global promotion of a transition to renewable source of electricity through facilitation of grid interconnection with independent power producer ; a global moratorium on the building of new coal-fired power station ; and recycling of carbon revenue to promote uptake of renewable energy source in developing country , particularly Brazil , India and China . Taken a a group , it is argued that these step are both necessary and sufficient . They call for institutional innovation at a global level that are politically difficult but feasible , given the magnitude of the problem addressed . ( c ) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd .

aVDuring the last three decade , oil crisis , agricultural surplus and global climate change enhanced the interest in short-rotation forestry ( SRF ) . In this study , the biomass production of birch ( Betula pendula Roth ) , maple ( Acer pseudoplatanus L.-Tintigny ) , poplar ( Populus trichocarpa x deltoides -Hoogvorst ) and willow ( Salix viminalis-Orm ) growing under a short-rotation ( SR ) management system were compared after a 4 year period . The plantation wa established on former agricultural land . The sandy soil had a mean pH of 4.5 and a mean carbon content of 1.0 % . Survival rate after 4 year were 75.8 % , 96.8 % , 86.3 % and 97.6 % for birch , maple , poplar and willow , respectively . The mean actual annual biomass production for these four specie amounted to 2.6 , 1.2 , 3.5 and 3.4 t DM ha ( -1 ) yr ( -1 ) , respectively . The large variation in biomass production at the different plot of the plantation could not be explained by the measured soil parameter . Biomass production result found here were in the lower range of value reported in literature . However , in contrast to most other study , no weed control , fertilisation or irrigation wa applied in this experiment . As marginal agricultural soil are suboptimal for the growth of poplar and willow , birch can be considered a a very interesting alternative for the establishment of SR plantation in Flanders .

aVThe fore-sighting exercise undertaken at the Australian Rangeland Society Conference at Port Augusta 10 year ago in 1996 developed four scenario : 'economic growth ' , 'best practice ' , 'extra green ' and 'partial retreat ' . These were later collapsed into two broad direction , ` looking out ' ( the economic reward generated by a full application of free market policy with rangeland enterprise having strong external linkage will result in production and management efficiency which benefit the Australian economy ) and 'looking in ' ( rangeland Australia and it human , economic and ecological resource will be best served by the development and maintenance of strong local community in each rangeland region ) . It wa anticipated that ` looking out ' would apply to only a few rangeland region where pastoral production is highly valued and rangeland are resilient ; ` looking in ' would apply to the majority of the rangeland where other value might outweigh pastoral production in the future and where the rangeland resource is considered le resilient . Given the world 's embrace of economic and trade globalisation , and the dominance in the federal sphere of one coalition government and one prime minister , it seems inevitable that across Australia the last 10 year were dominated by the ` looking out ' direction , while many marginal rangeland had few option but to 'look in ' . The 1996 discussion failed to appreciate fully the importance in shaping today 's world of singular issue such a terrorism , global climate change , potential disease pandemic , the emergence of China and India and , in an Australian rangeland context , the continuing success of the northern beef industry . In the interim , rangeland science ha produced an impressive underpinning of integrative information led both by industry investment and government funding . However , long-term resilience is still not assured in many area of Australia 's rangeland . It continues to be outpaced by those four horseman of the ( rangeland ) apocalypse : the need for growth , periodic drought , personal gain and introduced organism . During the next 2 decade the rangeland will be buffeted by many of the same old issue and well a obvious emerging one . Important human-centric one will be the tension between European and Aboriginal demographic trend , the increased economic dominance of mining , tourism and defence in the rangeland , and the 'sponge effect ' of successful town and particular enterprise . Ecological and bio-physical issue will include carbon trading , energy generation , water catchment , weed and disease and agricultural incursion into the northern rangeland . The broad direction of 'looking out ' and 'looking in ' still retain some currency for today 's rangeland decision maker but are now embedded in far stronger and shifting current that are frequently determined by global and national dynamic , rather than local issue . A distinguishing feature of the Australian rangeland is that they are still essentially intact ( apart from their fauna ) in a world context and may gain future ecological and economic advantage by remaining so . How to retain this status remains one of the great challenge for the next generation of Australian rangelanders .

aVAgricultural management of grassland result in sequestration and emission of greenhouse gas ( GHGs , particularly CO2 , N2O and CH4 ) . Here , we used a process-based model ( DNDC ) to estimate the flux of the major GHGs from grassland at 0.5 degree resolution across Europe , and combined these to produce a spatially explicit estimate of the total global warming potential ( GWP , expressed in CO2 equivalent ) . The DNDC model [ Li , C. , Frolking , S. , Crocker , G.J. , Grace , P.R. , Klir , J. , Korchens , M. , Poulton , P.R. , 1997 . Simulating trend in soil organic carbon in long-term experiment using the DNDC model . Geoderma 81 , 45-60 ] simulates carbon and nitrogen cycling in agroecosystems at a sub-daily time step and consists of four interacting submodels : soil and climate ( including water flow and leaching ) , plant growth , decomposition , and denitrification . Input data set for grassland area , climate , nitrogen deposition , and soil property were collated . The typical current grassland management regime wa established for ten biogeographical region on the basis of questionnaire sent to national expert , and used to derive model input data . A 20-year simulation wa carried out using DNDC for each site . Simple estimate of methane emission from grazing livestock were made according to the IPCC Tier 1 method . Most grassland area are net source for GHGs in term of total global warming potential-the beneficial effect of sequestering carbon in soil is outweighed by the emission of N2O from soil and ( predominantly ) CH4 emission from livestock . The net effect of European grassland on GWP ( emission of 23 Tg C year ( -1 ) ) corresponds to a 2.5 % increase on the EU-15 fossil fuel CO2 emission ( 907 Tg C year ( -1 ) ) .

aVEquilibrium carbon stock is the result of a balance between input and outflow to the pool . Changes in land-use are likely to alter such balance , resulting in different carbon store under different land-use type in addition to the impact of global climate change . In an agro-pastoral ecotone of Inner Mongolia , northern China , we investigated productivity and belowground carbon and nitrogen store under six different type of land-uses , namely free grazing ( FG ) , grazing exclusion ( GE ) , mowing ( MW ) , corn plantation ( CP ) , fallow ( FL ) , and alfalfa pasture ( AP ) , and their impact on litter and fine root in semiarid grassland ecosystem . We found that there were great variation in aboveground net primary production ( ANPP ) across the six land-use type , with CP having markedly high ANPP ; the FG had significantly reduced soil organic carbon ( SOC ) and nitrogen store ( SON ) to 100 cm depth compared with all other type of land us , while very little litter accumulation wa found on site of the FG and CP . The top 20 cm of soil accounted for about 80 % of the root carbon and nitrogen , with very little root being found below 50 cm . About 60 % of SOC and SON were stored in the top 30 cm layer . Land-use change altered the input of organic matter , thus affecting SOC and SON store accordingly ; the MW and GE site had 59 and 56 % more SOC and 61 % more SON than the FG . Our estimation suggested that restoring severely degraded and overgrazed grassland could potentially increase SOC and SON store by more than 55 % ; conversion from the native grass to alfalfa could potentially double the aboveground biomass production , and further increase SOC and SON store by more than 20 % . Our study demonstrated significant carbon and nitrogen storage potential of the agro-pastoral ecotone of northern China through land-use change and improved management in the context of mitigating global climate change .

aVDecomposition of soil organic carbon ( SOC ) is a critical component of the global carbon cycle , and accurate estimate of SOC decomposition are important for forest carbon modeling and ultimately for decision making relative to carbon sequestration and mitigation of global climate change . We determined the major pool of SOC in four site representing major forest type in China : temperate forest at Changbai Mountain ( CBM ) and Qilian Mountain ( QLM ) , and sub-tropical forest at Yujiang ( YJ ) and Liping ( LP ) county . A 90-day laboratory incubation wa conducted to measure CO2 evolution from forest soil from each site , and data from the incubation study were fitted to a three-pool first-order model that separated mineralizable soil organic carbon into active ( C-a ) , slow ( C-s ) and resistant ( C-r ) carbon pool . Results indicate that : ( 1 ) the rate of SOC decomposition in the sub-tropical zone wa faster than that in the temperature zone , ( 2 ) The C-a pool comprised similar to 1-3 % of SOC with an average mean residence time ( MRT ) of 219 day . The C-s pool comprised similar to 25-65 % with an average MRT of 78 yr . The C-r pool accounted for similar to 35-80 % of SOC , ( 3 ) The YJ site in the sub-tropical zone had the greatest C-a pool and the lowest MRT , while the QLM in the temperature zone had the greatest MRT for both the C-a and C-s pool . The result suggest a higher capacity for long-term C sequestration a SOC in temperature forest than in subtropical forest . ( C ) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVHigh-resolution sampling , measurement of organic carbon content and ( 14 ) C signature of selected four soil profile in the Haibei Station situated on the northeast Tibetan Plateau , and application of ( 14 ) C tracing technology were conducted in an attempt to investigate the turnover time of soil organic carbon and the soil-CO ( 2 ) flux in the alpine meadow ecosystem . The result show that the organic carbon stored in the soil varies from 22.12x10 ( 4 ) kg C hm ( -2 ) to 30.75x10 ( 4 ) kg C hm ( -2 ) in the alpine meadow ecosystem , with an average of 26.86x10 ( 4 ) kg C hm ( -2 ) . Turnover time of organic carbon pool increase with depth from 45 a to 73 a in the surface soil horizon to hundred of year or millennium or even longer at the deep soil horizon in the alpine meadow ecosystem . The soil-CO ( 2 ) flux range from 103.24 g C m ( -2 ) a ( -1 ) to 254.93 gC m ( -2 ) a ( -1 ) , with an average of 191.23 g C m ( -2 ) a ( -1 ) . The CO ( 2 ) efflux produced from microbial decomposition of organic matter varies from 73.3 g C m ( -2 ) a ( -1 ) to 181 g C m ( -2 ) a ( -1 ) . More than 30 % of total soil organic carbon resides in the active carbon pool and 72.8 % . 81.23 % of total CO ( 2 ) emitted from organic matter decomposition result from the topsoil horizon ( from 0 cm to 10 cm ) for the Kobresia meadow . Responding to global warming , the storage , volume of flow and fate of the soil organic carbon in the alpine meadow ecosystem of the Tibetan Plateau will be changed , which need further research .

aVIncreased release of carbon by world soil could drastically exacerbate atmospheric carbon dioxide ( CO , ) level , leading to accelerated global warming and eventually to a positive feedback mechanism that might cause climate change to get completely out of hand . [ ... ] the development of a new generation of mathematical model of soil ecosystem , needed to predict future soil carbon loss and their feedback on climate change with reasonable accuracy , will probably require the use , possibly even the creation , of mathematical tool radically different than those embodied in current model .

aVThe objective of the paper is to present sustainability indicator for municipal solid waste management ( MSWM ) . Sustainability implies environmental , economic and social acceptance . The complexity of the system-in-focus requires the employment of a system ( or cybernetic ) approach : Acceptance implies clear objective , from a specific point of view ( here , the viewpoint of the municipal administration is taken ) , over a time horizon covering at least two generation , a life-cycle consideration , clear evaluation criterion for alternative MSWM system , and finally specific and measurable indicator of the degree to which the objective have been met . In this paper , a number of specific environmental indicator ( abiotic depletion , human toxicity , global warming , acidification , eutrophication , photo-oxidant formation , etc . ) , economic indicator ( cost per ton or per household or per person , revenue from recovered material and energy , MSWM system cost a % of GNP of the city , diversion between revenue and expenditure for MSWM , cost per caput a % of minimum wage , subsidy per person ) and social indicator ( odor , visual impact , comfort , required or used-up space , noise , system complexity , employment quality , etc . ) are suggested for measuring the performance of municipal SWM system . Specific real application is mentioned for a Greek city .

aVMany shallow water subtidal habitat in Massachusetts , USA have recently been invaded by five non-indigenous ascidian specie : Ascidiella aspersa , Botrylloides violaceus , Didemnum sp. , Diplosoma listerianum and Styela clava . This study examined the effect of seawater temperature , a a proxy for climate change , on B. violaceus and D. listerianum and the impact these ascidian have on native sessile fouling community . Field experiment were conducted over a four month period at two location ( Lynn and Woods Hole , MA ) to examine growth dynamic over regional thermal and geographic range . Invasive ascidian occupied a much a 80 % of the primary substratum and accounted for the majority of specie richness . B. violaceus and D. listerianum growth were similar at both study site , but initial colony growth of D. listerianum wa positively affected by temperature . B. violaceus and D. listerianum exhibited rapid two-week growth rate during the summer month with more rapid growth at the warmer Woods Hole site . Competition for space between B. violaceus and D. listerianum typically resulted in neutral border between colony . Overgrowth occurred if the colony of one specie wa disproportionably larger than the colony of the other specie . Recruitment and growth of native specie influenced the long-term composition of experimental community more than the pre-seeding with B. violaceus or D. listerianum colony . Elevated temperature , however , increased initial growth of B. violaceus and D. listerianum and may have facilitated the specie success to invade the community during crucial period of introduction . With projected global climate change , a rise in sea surface temperature may exacerbate the cumulative impact of invasion on benthic community and facilitate the invasion of other non-native ascidian specie .

aVOn the basis of seasonal investigation at 23 degree 30 ' similar to 33 degree 00'N , 118 degree 30 ' similar to 128 degree 00'E of the East China Sea during 1997 similar to 2000 , dynamic on the density and diversity of Ostracoda wa discussed . Results showed that totally 26 specie were identified . The Ostracoda diversity wa opposite to the change of it density in most season which reflected an uneven assignment of Ostracoda density among it different specie . The Ostracoda density wa 0.70 ind./m ( 3 ) in spring , 1.72 ind./m ( 3 ) in summer , 2.57 ind./m ( 3 ) in autumn and 0.90 ind./m ( 3 ) in winter . Euconchoecia chierchiae in spring and winter , Euconchoecia maimai in summer and Cypridina dentata in autumn were main dominant specie in each season . The Ostracoda density did not show an obvious linear relationship with the hydrologic factor in summer and autumn , but wa related to the surface salinity in spring and the surface temperature in winter . Its high density area mainly distributed in the north offshore in all the season while in the south offshore in winter and in spring , and the south nearshore in summer and autumn , implied the zooplankton wa a typical warm water animal , whose high density distribution in autumn were located in a similar position to Todarodes pacificus , Navodon Septentrionalis , Scomber japonicus and other fish in the sea , so a to be an important indicator for fishing ground . The main specie dominating in Ostracoda now are different from the specie twenty year ago probably attribute to global warming .

aVAim Global climate change is increasingly influencing ecosystem . Long-term effect on the specie richness and composition of ecological community have been predicted using modelling approach but , so far , hardly demonstrated in the field . Here , we test whether change in the composition of bird community have been influenced by recent climate change . Location Europe . Methods We focus on the proportion of migratory and resident bird specie because these group are expected to respond differently to climatic change . We used the spatial relationship between climatic factor and bird community in Europe to predict change in 21 European bird community under recent climate change . Results Observed change corresponded significantly to predicted change and could not be explained by the effect of spatial autocorrelation . Alternative factor such a change in land use were tested in a first approximation a well but no effect were found . Main Conclusions This study demonstrates that global climate change ha already influenced the specie richness and composition of European bird community .

aVThe biogeochemical carbon cycle , which play an undeniable role in global climate change , is defined both by the size of carbon reservoir ( such a the atmosphere , biomass , soil and bedrock ) and the exchange between them of various mineral and organic carbon form . Among these carbon form , fossil organic carbon ( FOC ) ( i.e. , the ancient organic matter stored in sedimentary rock ) is widely observed in modem environment but is not included in the supergene carbon budget . Using a digitized map of the world and an existing model of CO2 consumption associated with rock weathering , we establish the global distribution of FOC stored in the first meter of sedimentary rock and a first estimation of annual FOC delivery to the modem environment resulting from chemical weathering of these rock . Results are given for the world 's 40 major river basin and extended to the entire continental surface . With a mean value of I 100 10 ( 9 ) t , mainly controlled by shale distribution , the global FOC stock is significant and comparable to that of soil organic carbon ( 1500 10 ( 9 ) t ) . The annual chemical delivery of FOC , estimated at 43 10 ( 6 ) t yr ( -1 ) and controlled by the areal distribution of shale and runoff is of the same order of magnitude a the FOC output flux to ocean . Chemical weathering of bedrock within the Amazon basin produce one-quarter of the total global flux of FOC derived from chemical weathering , and thus is expected to govern FOC release on a global scale . These result raise important question concerning the role of FOC in the modem carbon cycle a well a the origin and the budget of carbon in soil and river . ( C ) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

aVThis paper ha studied the change of streamflow and the impact of climatic variability condition on regional hydrological cycle in the headwater of the Tarim River Basin . This study investigates possible cause of observed trend in streamflow in an environment which is highly variable in term of atmospheric condition , and where snow and ice melt play an important role in the natural hydrological regime . The discharge trend of three head stream have a significant increase trend from 1957 to 2002 with the Mann-Kendall test . Complex time-frequency distribution in the streamflow regime are demonstrated especially by Morlet wavelet analysis over 40 year . The purpose is to ascertain the nature of climatic factor spatial and temporal distribution , involved the use of EOF ( Empirical Orthogonal Function ) to compare the dominant temperature , precipitation and evaporation pattern from normally climatic record over the Tarim 's headwater basin . It show that the first principal component wa dominated since the 1990s for temperature and precipitation , which identifies the significant ascending trend of spatial and temporal pattern characteristic under the condition of the global warming . An exponential correlation is highlighted between surface air temperature and mean river discharge monthly , so the regional runoff increase by 10 % -16 % when surface air temperature rise by 1 degree C. Results suggest that headwater basin are the most vulnerable environment from the point of view of climate change , because their watershed property promote runoff feeding by glacier and snow melt water and their fundamental vulnerability to temperature change affect rainfall , snowfall , and glacier and ice melt .

aVTo examine the synergism of high temperature and sulfide on two dominant tropical seagrass specie , a large-scale mesocosm experiment wa conducted in which sulfide accumulation rate ( SAR ) were increased by adding labile carbon ( glucose ) to intact seagrass sediment core across a range of temperature . During the initial 10 d of the 38 d experiment , porewater SAR in core increased 2- to 3-fold from 44 and 136 mu mol L ( -1 ) d ( -1 ) at 28-29 degree C to 80 and 308 mu mol L ( -1 ) d ( -1 ) at 34-35 degree C in Halodule wrightii and Thalassia testudinum core , respectively . Labile C addition to the sediment resulted in SAR of 443 and 601 mu mol L ( -1 ) d ( -1 ) at 28-29 degree C and 758 to 1,557 mu mol L ( -1 ) d ( -1 ) at 34-35 degree C in H. wrightii and T testudinton core , respectively . Both T testudinum and H. wrightii were highly thermal tolerant , demonstrating their tropical affinity and potential to adapt to high temperature , While plant survived the 38 d temperature treatment , there wa a clear thermal threshold above 33 degree C where T testudinum growth declined and leaf quantum efficiency ( Fv/Fm ) fell below 0.7 . At this threshold temperature , H. wrightii maintained shoot density and leaf quantum efficiency . Although H. wrigghtii showed a greater tolerance to high temperature , T testudinum had a greater capacity to sustain biomass and short shoot under thermal stress with labile C enrichment , regardless of the fact that sulfide level in the T testudium core were 2 time higher than in the H. wrightii core . Tropical seagrass tolerance to elevated temperature , predicted in the future with global warming , should be considered in the context of the sediment-plant complex which incorporates the synergism of plant physiological response and shift in sulfur biogeochemistry leading to increased plant exposure to sulfide , a known toxin .

aVThe temperate glacier in the greater Himalayas ( GH ) and the neighboring region contribute to the freshwater supply for almost one-half of the people on earth . Under global warming condition , the GH glacier may melt more rapidly than high-latitude glacier , owing to the coincidence of the accumulation and ablation season in summer . Based on a first-order energy balance approach for glacier thermodynamics , the possible imposed additional melting rate wa estimated from three climate simulation using the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Global Coupled Climate Model version 2.1 ( GFDL-CM2.1 ) , the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate 3.2 , high-resolution version ( MIROC3.2-hires ) , and the Met Office 's Third Hadley Centre Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere General Circulation Model ( HadCM3 ) . The simulation were carried out under the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios ( SRES ) A1B scenario . For the 30-yr period of 2001-30 , all three CGCMs indicate that the glacial region most sensitive to regional warming are the Tianshan-Altai Mountains to the north and Hengduan Mountains to the south . A map of potential melting wa produced and wa used to calculate the glacier-melting speed , yielding an additional spatially averaged glacier depth reduction of approximately 2 m for the 2001-30 period for those area located below 4000 m. Averaged over the entire GH region , the melting rate is accelerating at about 5 mm yr ( -2 ) . The general circulation over the GH region wa found to have clear multidecadal variability , with the 30-yr period of 2001-30 likely to be wetter than the previous 30-yr period of 1971-2000 . Considering the possible trend in precipitation from snow to rain , the actual melting rate of the GH glacier may even be larger than those obtained in this research .

aVThe pine processionary moth Thatimetopoea pilyocampa is expanding it geographical range in Europe , a a consequence of enhanced winter survival under a warmer climate . A combination of daytime nest temperature and night air temperature determines the number of hour larva are able to feed ( hour above realized feeding threshold , RFT ) . We tested the RFT-based model for survival across multiple area of the insect 's range in the Italian Alps over a 2-year period . In a series of translocation experiment using natural temperature gradient a spatial analogue for global warming , we transferred colony of T pityocampa larva to site within zone of historical distribution , recent distribution , and outside the present range . The site included traditional ( Pinus nigra , Pinus sylvestris ) a well a novel ( Pinus mugo , Pinus uncinata , Pinus cembra ) host . Survival during precold ( August to November ) , cold ( December to February ) and postcold ( March to May ) period were analysed against climatic variable ( temperature and rainfall ) and predictor developed by the model . Host specie did not significantly affect final survival , with the exception of slower larval development , and resulting lower cold tolerance , on P cembra than on R mugo at the same site . Across all the site and host , final survival of colony depended on the number of feeding hour during the cold period ( RFT ) , which explained 82 % of the variance in a regression model . We recommend using RFT , or it surrogate daily mean minimum temperature when nest temperature is not available , in predictive model of range expansion of T pityocampa under climate change scenario .

aVRecent study have indicated that temporal mismatch between interacting population may be caused by consequence of global warming , for example rising spring temperature . However , little is known about the impact of spatial temperature gradient , their vulnerability to global warming , and their importance for interacting population . Here , we studied the vertical distribution of two planktivorous fish specie ( Coregonus spp . ) and their zooplankton prey in the deep , oligotrophic Lake Stechlin ( Germany ) . The night-time vertical centre of gravity both of the fish population and of two of their prey group , daphnids and copepod , were significantly correlated to the seasonally varying water temperature between March and December 2005 . During the warmer month , fish and zooplankton occurred closer to the surface of the lake and experienced higher temperature . The Coregonus population differed significantly in their centre of gravity ; hence , also , the temperature experienced by the population wa different . Likewise , daphnids and copepod occurred in different water depth and hence experienced different temperature at least during the summer month . We conclude that any change in the vertical temperature gradient of the lake a a result of potential future global warming may impact the two fish population differently , and may shape interaction strength and timing between fish and their zooplankton prey .

aVObjectives : The author examined the increase in mortality associated with hot and cold temperature in different location , the determinant of the variability in effect estimate , and it implication for adaptation . Methods : The author conducted a case-crossover study in 50 US city . They used daily mortality and weather data for 6 513 330 death occurring during 1989 -2000 . Exposure wa assessed using two approach . First , the author determined exposure to extreme temperature using city-specific indicator variable based on the local temperature distribution . Secondly , they used piecewise linear variable to ass exposure to temperature on a continuous scale above/ below a threshold . Effects of hot and cold temperature were examined in season-specific model . In a meta-analysis of the city-specific result , the author examined several city characteristic a effect modifier . Results : Mortality increase associated with both extreme cold ( 2-day cumulative increase 1.59 % ( 95 % CI 0.56 to 2.63 ) ) and extreme heat ( 5.74 % ( 95 % CI 3.38 to 8.15 ) ) were found , the former being especially marked for myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest death . The increase in mortality wa le marked at le extreme temperature . The effect of extreme cold ( defined a a percentile ) wa homogeneous across city with different climate , suggesting that only the unusualness of the cold temperature ( and not it absolute value ) had a substantial impact on mortality ( that is , acclimatisation to cold ) . Conversely , heat effect were quite heterogeneous , with the largest effect observed in city with milder summer , le air conditioning and higher population density . Adjustment for ozone led to similar result , but some residual confounding could be present due to other uncontrolled pollutant . Conclusions : The author confirmed in a large sample of city that both cold and hot temperature increase mortality risk . These finding suggest that increase in heat-related mortality due to global warming are unlikely to be compensated for by decrease in cold-related mortality and that population acclimatisation to heat is still incomplete .

aVUsing Christmas Bird Count data , we analyze the annual spatio-temporal abundance of six passerine specie in the upper Great Plains , US ( 1960-1990 ) . This study provides new insight into how global warming could cause separation of specie within present-day community . We find that winter relative abundance of similarly-sized songbird are differentially affected by ambient winter temperature . As such , average annual winter temperature fluctuation ( i.e. , severity of winter ) are significantly ( P < 0.05 ) correlated with the relative abundance of three specie while the other three are not . Our conditional probability-of-occurrence analysis indicates that the abundance of the three temperature-associated specie declined markedly below -4 degree C while the abundance of the other three specie fluctuated little from 8 degree C to -16 degree C. We conclude that even in colder climate i ) the winter distribution of some , but not all , songbird are directly or indirectly limited by temperature ; and ii ) these bird have dynamic abundance that can quickly respond to temperature change .

aVTemperature and heavy metal such a cadmium ( Cd ) are important environmental stressor that can strongly affect mitochondrial function of marine poikilotherm . In this study , we investigated the combined effect of temperature ( 20 degree C and 30 degree C ) and Cd stress on production of reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) and oxidative stress in a marine poikilotherm Crassostrea virginica ( the eastern oyster ) using mitochondrial aconitase a a sensitive biomarker of oxidative damage . We also assessed potential involvement of mitochondrial uncoupling protein ( UCPs ) in antioxidant protection in oyster mitochondrion using purine nucleotide ( GDP , ATP and ADP ) a specific inhibitor , and free fatty acid a stimulators , of UCPs . Our result show that exposure to Cd result in elevated ROS production and oxidative damage a indicated by aconitase inactivation which is particularly pronounced at elevated temperature . Unexpectedly , oyster mitochondrial aconitase wa inhibited by physiologically relevant level of ATP ( IC50 = 1.93 and 3.04 mmol l ( -1 ) at 20 degree C and 30 degree C , respectively ) , suggesting that allosteric regulation of aconitase by this nucleotide may be involved in regulation of the tricarboxylic acid flux in oyster . Aconitase wa le sensitive to ATP inhibition at 30 degree C than at 20 degree C , consistent with the elevated metabolic flux at higher temperature . ADP and GDP also inhibited mitochondrial aconitase but at the level well above the physiological concentration of these nucleotide ( 6-11 mmol l ( -1 ) ) . Our study show expression of at least three UCP isoforms in C. virginica gill tissue but provides no indication that UCPs protect mitochondrial aconitase from oxidative inactivation in oyster . Overall , the result of this study indicate that temperature stress exaggerates toxicity of Cd leading to elevated oxidative stress in mitochondrion , which may have important implication for survival of poikilotherm in polluted environment during seasonal warming and/or global climate change , and suggest a novel temperature-dependent mechanism of allosteric regulation of TCA flux in oyster mitochondrion .

aVThe specie composition of euphausiids wa investigated in relationship to the hydrographic condition in the North Atlantic cold-core ring ( CCR ) and adjacent water to elucidate specie succession in evolving water mass . Using data , dating back to the 1970s , from a many CCRs a possible and selecting typical case where no major physical perturbation occurred , a general pattern of euphausiid succession and change in vertical distribution in ring with time wa obtained . This pattern wa related to the general distribution of euphausiids in the northwestern North Atlantic Ocean , aiming at providing basic information on probable response of North Atlantic marine ecosystem to global warming . Of the 34 euphausiid specie identified , 5 were cold-water specie , 17 were warm-water specie , 6 were wide-ranging warm-water specie , 1 wa transitional , 4 were cosmopolitan and the remaining wa Thysanoessa parva . Among cold-water specie , Euphausia krohni and Nematoscelis megalops were dominant in CCRs . E. krohni became rare in ring older than 6 month , whereas N. megalops survived longer , being abundant in some ring of 9 month or older , by staying within it preferred temperature range a the CCR elevated isotherm sank to depth where they are normally found in the Sargasso Sea and because it is an omnivore-carnivore . Among warm-water specie , epipelagic specie appeared first in ring , corresponding to the physical change occurring most rapidly in the surface layer . Mesopelagic specie appeared later . Cold-water specie made up 65-85 % of the total euphausiid population in number in younger ring ( 1-5 month old ) , while warm-water specie contributed only 2-7 % . Wide-ranging warm-water specie made up about up to one fourth of the total in ring 5 and 7 month old . Warm-water specie , mainly E. brevis , increased in older ring ( 9 month old or older ) and made up 50 % of the total in the oldest ring . The contribution of cold-water specie decreased to 14 % in older ring . T. parva made up 26-38 % of the total in ring 6 month or older . CCR population can be characterized by high specie number , but intermediate evenness between the Slope Water and northern Sargasso Sea . In CCRs , only a limited number of specie were dominant even if there were more specie present in ring a old a 9-12 month than in the northern Sargasso Sea . In ring older than 9 month , euphausiids showed two peak in their vertical distribution : a shallow daytime peak at about 400 m and a nighttime peak in the upper 100 m consisting of warm-water specie ( mainly E. brevis ) and a deeper persistent peak at 800 in or deeper consisting of the specie N. megalops and T. parva . This shallow peak in CCRs is shallower than that in the surrounding northern Sargasso Sea , and the deep peak is rarely observed in these water . ( c ) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVThe amplitude of the CO ( 2 ) seasonal cycle at the Mauna Loa Observatory ( MLO ) increased from the early 1970s to the early 1990s but decreased thereafter despite continued warming over northern continent . Because of it location relative to the large-scale atmospheric circulation , the MLO receives mainly Eurasian air mass in the northern hemisphere ( NH ) winter but relatively more North American air mass in NH summer . Consistent with this seasonal footprint , our finding indicate that the MLO amplitude register North American net carbon uptake during the warm season and Eurasian net carbon release a well a anomaly in atmospheric circulation during the cold season . From the early 1970s to the early 1990s , our analysis wa consistent with that of Keeling et al . [ Keeling CID , Chin JFS , Whorf TP ( 1996 ) Nature 382:146-149 ] , suggesting that the increase in the MILO CO ( 2 ) amplitude is dominated by enhanced photosynthetic drawdown in North America and enhanced respiration in Eurasia . In contrast , the recent decline in the CO ( 2 ) amplitude is attributed to reduction in carbon sequestration over North America associated with severe drought from 1998 to 2003 and change in atmospheric circulation leading to decreased influence of Eurasian air mass . With the return of rain to the U.S. in 2004 , both the normalized difference vegetation index and the MLO amplitude sharply increased , suggesting a return of the North American carbon sink to more normal level . These finding indicate that atmospheric CO ( 2 ) measurement at remote site can continue to play an important role in documenting change in land carbon flux , including those related to widespread drought , which may continue to worsen a a result of global warming .

aVScope and Background . The environmental effectiveness of the Norwegian beverage sector ha been studied in a Factor 10 perspective . The objective of the study wa to identify strategy that could make the beverage sector radically more effective from an environmental and resource perspective , leading to a Factor 10 improvement . Another main purpose of the work wa to test the potential for using Life Cycle Assessment ( LCA ) methodology on an economic sector with a network of product chain , rather than for a single product . Methods . Life Cycle Assessment data from STO 's own study and literature study have been used a a basis for analysis of the environmental status of the beverage sector in Norway . The functional unit wa defined a the amount of beverage product consumed per caput in Norway in the year 2000 . The study includes raw material production , production of the beverage product , packaging manufacture , distribution , use and waste management of the product . The study ha , for practical reason , been limited to the environmental impact indicator total energy consumption and global warming potential . This wa done a other type of data have been difficult to obtain for all of the product that were studied ( tap water , coffee , milk , soft drink , beer , squash , juice and bottled water ) . Results and Discussion . The study show difference between the drinking product with respect to energy consumption and emission that can contribute to global warming . Due to large uncertainty in the data , general conclusion regarding the differentiation of product based on environmental performance should be made with care . Production and distribution of tap water is , however , significantly le energy intensive than the other product . For the impact category studied , production of raw material wa the most important part of the life cycle for most drinking product . Conclusions and Perspectives . The most significant contribution to achieving a Factor 10 development can be made by consuming more water , especially tap water , and through improving raw material production in the agricultural sector . Packaging and distribution is responsible for only a small part of the energy consumption and emission leading to global warming . Optimal packaging size might however reduce loss of product in the user phase , which is important in order to improve the system . A Factor 10 level seems achievable only if the consumption of tap water is increased to a high level .

aVGoal and Scope . Many life cycle assessment case study neglect the production of capital good that are necessary to manufacture a good or to provide a service . In ISO standard 14040 and 14044 the capital good are explicitly part of the product system . Thus , it is doubtful if capital good can be excluded per se a ha been done in quite a number of case study and LCA database . There is yet no clear idea about if and when capital good play an important role in life cycle assessment . The present paper evaluates the contribution of capital good in a large number and variety of product and service system . A classification of product and service group is proposed to give better guidance on when and where capital good should be included or can be neglected . Methods . The life cycle inventory database ecoinvent data v1.2 form the basis for the assessment of the environmental importance of capital good . The importance is assessed on the basis of several hundred of cradle-to-gate LCAs of heat and electricity supply system , of material extraction and production , of agricultural product , and of transport and waste management service . The importance within product ( and service ) group is evaluated with statistical method by comparing the LCA result including and excluding capital good . The assessment is based on characterised cumulative LCI result using the CML baseline characterisation factor of the impact category of global warming , acidification , eutrophication , human toxicity , freshwater acquatic toxicity , terrestrial ecotoxicity , ionising radiation , and land competition , based on proxy indicator ( fossil and nuclear ) cumulative energy demand , and based on the endpoint indicator Eco-indicator 99 ( H , A ) mineral resource , human health , eco system quality and total . Results . The analysis confirms the fact that capital good can not be excluded per se . On one hand , toxicity related environmental impact such a freshwater ecotoxicity or human toxicity are more sensitive towards an inclusion or exclusion of capital good . On the other , certain product like photovoltaic and wind electricity are very much or even completely affected by capital good contribution , no matter which indicator is chosen . Nuclear electricity , agricultural product and process , and transport service often behave differently ( showing a higher or lower share of capital good contribution ) than product from other sector . Discussions . Some indicator analysed in this paper show a rather similar behaviour across all sector analysed . This is particularly true for 'mineral resource ' , and - to a lesser extent - for 'Eco-indicator 99 total ' , 'acidification ' and 'climate change ' . On the other hand , 'land use ' and 'freshwater ecotoxicity ' show the most contrasting behaviour with share of capital good ' impact between le than 1 % and more than 98 % . Recommendations . Capital good must be included in the assessment of climate change impact of non-fossil electricity , agricultural product and process , transport service and waste management service . They must be included in any sector regarding the assessment of toxic effect . Energy analysis ( quantifying the non-renewable cumulative energy demand ) of agricultural product and process , of wooden product and of transport service should include capital good a well . The mixing of datasets including and excluding capital good is no problem a long a their share on total impact is low and partial omission do not lead to a significant imbalance in comparative assertion . Perspectives . If in doubt whether or not to include capital good , it is recommended to check two thing : ( 1 ) whether maintenance and depreciation cost of capital equipment form a substantial part of the product price ( Heijungs et al . 1992a ) , and ( 2 ) whether actual environmental hot spot occur along the capital good ' supply chain .

aVThe EU-CLOUDMAP project took place between 1997-2000 a a collaboration between five university and government research group in the UK , Germany , the Netherlands and Switzerland . The original scientific motivation of the EU-CLOUDMAP Project wa to improve the measurement and characterization of cirrus and contrail cloud property . IPCC ( Penner et al . 1999 ) demonstrated that contrail cloud could play a small but significant role in changing the radiative balance of the atmosphere based on work from one of the CLOUDMAP partner ( DLR ) using AVHRR data over Europe . However , the scope wa broadened to include property of cloud at all altitude a ( Cess et al . 1993 ) had shown that depending on how cloud process are parameterised can lead to an order of magnitude difference in prediction of surface temperature due to change in CO2 radiative forcing . This error is by far the largest uncertainty in making accurate forecast of global warming . The primary technological motivation of the Project wa to develop new technique for deriving cloud-top property ( cloud-top height , amount , microphysics and wind ) from a new series of meteorological sensor based on the use of either cloud-top stereo ( ATSR-2 and MISR ) or Oxygen A-band ( MOS ) and their application to the generation of new cloud climatology product . A secondary goal wa to develop an automated technique , based on fuzzy logic , to detect contrail in non-thermal imagery where contrail can only be detected through their unique spatial characteristic . Validation of cloud product wa perceived a a crucial central issue to any adoption of these product by the Numerical Weather Prediction ( NWP ) and climate forecasting community . This present unique challenge a validation must be conducted simultaneously with satellite data acquisition . Ground-based remote sensing technique exploiting continuously operating radar and lidar were used and a new technique based on visible stereo digital camera for retrieving cloud-base property wa pioneered . A technology spin-off from the CLOUDMAP work at UCL wa the development of an uncooled thermal IR fish-eye lens camera for continuously monitoring cloud cover from the ground to replace existing manual observation of cloud cover ( Chapman et al . 2007 ) . Eight paper in this issue show some of the highlight of the project including fundamental aspect of the algorithm for retrieval of cloud-top height using stereo photogrammetry from ATSR-2 ( Muller et al . 2007 , Denis et al . 2007 ) and MOMS ( Drescher 2007 ) and Oxygen A-band from MOS ( Preusker et al . 2007 ) . Seiz et al . ( 2007 ) describe the development of a novel technique for the automated retrieval of cloud-base height from stereo visible digital camera . Naud et al . ( 2007 ) describe the validation of cloud-top height from ATSR-2 and MOS using ground-based radar and lidar . Hetzheim ( 2007 ) show how fuzzy logic system can be employed for contrail detection when thermal imagery is not available using MOS and ATSR-2 to demonstrate his technique . Finally , Meyer et al . ( 2007 ) show result from applying the thermal IR contrail detection technique to AVHRR over Asia .

aVPotential global climate change impact on hydrology pose a threat to water resource system throughout the world . The California water system is especially vulnerable to global warming due to it dependence on mountain snow accumulation and the snowmelt process . Since 1983 , more than 60 study have investigated climate change impact on hydrology and water resource in California . These study can be categorized in three major field : ( 1 ) Studies of historical trend of streamflow and snowpack in order to determine if there is any evidence of climate change in the geophysical record ; ( 2 ) Studies of potential future predicted effect of climate change on streamflow and ; ( 3 ) Studies that use those predicted change in natural runoff to determine their economic , ecologic , or institutional impact . In this paper we review these study with an emphasis on methodological procedure . We provide for each category of study a summary of significant conclusion and potential area for future work .

aVGlobally , peat land are considered to be a sink of CO2 , but a source when drained . Additionally , wet peat land are thought to emit considerable amount of CH4 and N2O . Hitherto , reliable and integrated estimate of emission and emission factor for this type of land cover have been lacking and the effect of wetland restoration on methane emission have been poorly quantified . In this paper we estimate the full greenhouse gas ( GHG ) balance of a restored natural peat land by determining the flux of CO2 , CH4 and N2O through atmosphere and water , while accounting for the different Global Warming Potentials ( GWP 's ) . The site is an abandoned agricultural peat meadow , which ha been converted into a wetland nature reserve ten year ago , after which the water level wa raised . GHG flux were measured continuously with an eddy covariance system ( CO2 ) and flux chamber measurement ( CH4 and N2O ) . Meteorological and hydrological measurement were collected a well . With growing season of respectively 192 , 168 and 129 day , the annual net ecosystem exchange of CO2 ( NEE ) wa -446+ +/- 83 g C m ( -2 ) yr ( -1 ) for 2004 , -311 +/- 58 g C m ( -2 ) yr ( -1 ) for 2005 and -232 +/- 57 g m ( -2 ) yr ( -1 ) for 2006 . Ecosystem respiration ( Reco ) wa estimated a 869 +/- 668 g C m ( -2 ) yr ( -1 ) for 2004 , 866 +/- 666 g C m ( -2 ) yr ( -1 ) for 2005 and 924 +/- 711 g C m ( -2 ) yr ( -1 ) for 2006 . CH4 emission from the saturated land and water surface were high compared to the relatively dry land . Annual weighted CH4 emission were 31.27 +/- 20.40 g C m ( -2 ) yr ( -1 ) for 2005 and 32.27 +/- 21.08 g C m ( -2 ) yr ( -1 ) for 2006 . N2O flux were too low to be of significance . The water balance of the area wa dominated by precipitation and evapotranspiration and therefore flux of carbon and CH4 through seepage , infiltration and drainage were relatively small ( 17.25 g C m ( -2 ) yr ( -1 ) ) . The carbon- balance consisted for the largest part of CO2 uptake , CO2 respiration and CH4 emission from water saturated land and water . CO2 emission ha decreased significantly a result of the raised water table , while CH4 flux have increased . In GWP 's the area wa a small net GHG sink given a CO2- equiv . of - 86 g m ( -2 ) yr ( -1 ) ( over a 100-year period ) .

aVClimate change induced by global warming is a result of an excess of energy at the earth 's surface due to the greenhouse effect . But a new energy management can reverse the situation taking advantage of the greenhouse effect to produce renewable energy . In fact , both the renewable energy and the energy consumed which are not dissipated into heat are subtracted from the excess of energy produced by the greenhouse effect and contribute to mitigate climate change . This open perspective to harness the greenhouse effect [ F. Meunier , Domestiquer l'effet de serre , Dunod , 2005 ] . Should all the primary energy be renewable energy and should part of the energy production not dissipated into heat , the present earth 's energy imbalance should be beneficial and should serve to produce renewable energy .

aVThere ha been a heightened interest in sea surface temperature ( SST ) measurement during the past two decade , particularly on a global scale , due largely to the advent of several El Nino episode and increasing worldwide concern about global warming . Because of the continuous global measurement of SST that satellite can provide they play a fundamental role in acquiring the data set necessary for study of such climate process . However , the satellite data still need to be validated against in situ measurement in order to ass the accuracy of satellite SST retrieval algorithm . Validation of such SST retrieval algorithm is the primary aim of the SST measurement program component of the Hillarys Transect . This paper describes a methodology for the validation of satellite-derived SST a well a the seasonal variation of SST off the coast of southern Western Australia . It discus the factor which may affect the quality of in situ validation data and concludes that measurement of the bulk sea surface temperature ( BSST ) should be the preferred in situ data source for validation of satellite-based algorithm derived from floating buoy measurement . In this study BSST data possessed superior accuracy over the coincident radiometric sea surface skin temperature ( SSST ) data , and were found to be significantly better for validation purpose under wind speed condition below 4 m ( -1 ) .

aVUnderstanding the process of groundwater recharge is fundamental to the management of groundwater resource . Quantifying the future evolution of recharge over time requires not only the reliable forecasting of change in key climatic variable , but also modelling their impact on the spatially varying recharge process . This paper present a physically based methodology that can be used to characterize both the temporal and spatial effect of climate change on groundwater recharge . The method , based on the hydrologic model HELP3 , can be used to estimate potential groundwater recharge at the regional scale with high spatial and temporal resolution . In this study , the method is used to simulate the past condition , with 40 year of actual weather data , and future change in the hydrologic cycle of the Grand River watershed . The impact of climate change is modelled by perturbing the model input parameter using predicted change in the region climate . The result of the study indicate that the overall rate of groundwater recharge is predicted to increase a a result of climate change . The higher intensity and frequency of precipitation will also contribute significantly to surface runoff , white global warming may result in increased evapotranspiration rate . Warmer winter temperature will reduce the extent of ground frost and shift the spring melt from spring toward winter , allowing more water to infiltrate into the ground . White many previous climate change impact study have focused on the temporal change in groundwater recharge , our result suggest that the impact can also have high spatial variability .

aVThe aim of this study wa to investigate long-term seasonal trend and decadal change pattern of monthly mean water vapor pressure ( WVP ) observation series at 16 meteorological station scattered point-wisely over the Southeastern Anatolian Project ( GAP ) area in Turkey , where large-scale soil and water development project have been put into practice since the 1970s . The record length of WVP observation series of each station varied between 31- and 41-years between 1962 and 2002 . The monthly mean WVP observation series of each station wa rearranged on seasonal basis . Sequential Mann-Kendall trend test , Sen 's slope estimator , and Spearman 's rank-order correlation test were employed for detection of likely trend , and Kruskall-Wallis test wa used to detect decadal variation in WVP series of each observation station . A possible area of representation for each meteorological station wa determined by using the Thiessen polygon technique in a geographical information system medium . It wa found that 15 seasonal WVP series have a positive trend covering 97 % of the GAP area in the summer season ; although one WVP series ha a negative trend direction . However , in the spring season , 33 % of the area had a positive trend , and a negative trend did not appear in any station . WVP record in the winter season showed an increasing trend over 19 % of the GAP area , whereas a decreasing trend prevailed in 9 % of the area . The study result led u to conclude that the substantial increase of WVP observation in summer season could be attributed to both the shift from rain-fed agriculture to irrigated agriculture being made increasingly spacious year by year and building large water reservoir in the GAP located in a semi-arid region . The result also indirectly suggested that the historical trend in the WVP parameter might be related to global climate change phenomenon .

aVAdvanced Very High Resolution Radiometer ( AVHRR ) -derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ( NDVI ) data are widely used in global-change research , yet relationship between the NDVI and ecoclimatological variable are not fully understood . This study attempt to model climate-driven vegetation dynamic through the integration of satellite-derived NDVI data with climate data collected from ground-based meteorological station in the US Great Plains . Monthly maximum value composite of NDVI data ( 8-km resolution ) and monthly temperature and precipitation record from 305 station were collected from 1982 to 2001 . Analyses involving deseasonalized datasets supported temperature a the dominant climate regime , demonstrating a higher average NDVI-temperature correlation ( r=0.73 ) than the NDVI-precipitation relationship ( r50.38 ) . Cluster analysis wa used to develop a climate regionalization scheme based primarily on temperature , and NDVI characteristic of each subregion were compared . In the context of global climate change , finding from this study emphasize the influence of temperature and precipitation variability over vegetation cover in the Great Plains region .

aVIt is shown that the melting of ice floating on the ocean will introduce a volume of water about 2.6 per cent greater than that of the originally displaced sea water . The melting of floating ice in a global warming will cause the ocean to rise . If all the extant sea ice and floating shelf ice melted , the global sea level would rise about 4 cm . The sliding of grounded ice into the sea , however , produce a mean water level rise in two part ; some of the rise is delayed . The first part , while the ice float , is equal to the volume of displaced sea water . The second part , equal to 2.6 per cent of the first , is contributed a it melt . These effect result from the difference in volume of equal weight of fresh and salt water . This component of sea rise is apparently unrecognized in the literature to date , although it can be interpreted a a form of halosteric sea level change by regarding the displaced salt water and the meltwater ( even before melting ) a a unit . Although salinity change are known to affect sea level , all existing analysis omit our calculated volume change . We present a protocol that can be used to calculate global sea level rise on the basis of the addition of meltwater from grounded and floating ice ; of course thermosteric volume change must be added .

aVWe describe the manifestation and occurrence of hypotrichosis in arctic fox and compare it to the Samson character in red fox . During 1979-2005 , we collected carcass of both normal and hypotrichotic arctic fox from foxhunters in Iceland for macroscopic and microscopic examination and study of demography . We obtained live pup for breeding and transmission experiment in captivity during 1985-1992 . Placental scar count showed that hypotrichotic vixen were more fertile than normal vixen and generally all their pup were hypotrichotic . Fertility in hypotrichotic vixen wa positively correlated with winter air temperature but not in normal vixen . Hypotrichotic male were le likely to breed than normal male and probably had a higher mortality rate than either hypotrichotic female or normal fox . Hypotrichosis can be transmitted between adult fox . Microscopic examination revealed prominent chronic inflammation of the dermis in hypotrichotic specimen , degenerative change , vacuolisation and necrosis of hair follicle . Hypotrichosis persists in coastal area with mild winter and may become more common with global warming .

aVThe technology of the deep-ocean CO ( 2 ) storage is expected to directly mitigate the source of the global warming . At deep-ocean condition above 4.45 MPa and below 283 K , the CO ( 2 ) clathrate hydrate crystal are formed a membrane at the interface between the liquid-water phase and the liquid-CO ( 2 ) phase . Since the strength and the thickness of the hydrate membrane are crucial to the storage period , it is important to experimentally measure the mechanical characteristic of the CO ( 2 ) hydrate membrane and the hydrate droplet . In the present study , the CO ( 2 ) hydrate membrane thickness is measured by using the laser-light interference method . It is clarified that the present method by using the beam light interference method is applicable to measure the CO ( 2 ) hydrate membrane . The hydrate membrane thickness is estimated to be about 7 mu m similar to 12 mu m at 10MPa and 275 K similar to 283 K. It is also clarified that thickness of the CO ( 2 ) hydrate membrane is in proportion to the temperature .

aVA study of upper Paleocene-lower Eocene ( P-E ) sediment deposited on the Lomonosov Ridge in the central Arctic Ocean reveals relatively high abundance of terrestrial biomarkers . These include dehydroabietane and simonellite derived from conifer ( gymnosperm ) and a tetra-aromatic triterpenoid derived from angiosperm . The relative percentage of the angiosperm biomarker of the summed angiosperm +conifer biomarkers wa increased at the end of the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum ( PETM ) , different when observed with pollen count which showed a relative decrease in angiosperm pollen . Stable carbon isotopic analysis of these biomarkers show that the negative carbon isotope excursion ( CIE ) during the PETM amount to 3 part per thousand for both conifer biomarkers , dehydroabietane and simonellite , comparable to the magnitude of the CIE inferred from marine carbonate , but significantly lower than the 4.5 part per thousand of the terrestrial C ( 29 ) n-alkane [ M. Pagani , N. Pedentchouk , M. Huber , A. Sluijs , S. Schouten , H. Brinkhuis , J.S . Sinninghe Damste , G.R . Dickens , and the IODP Expedition 302 Expedition Scientists ( 2006 ) , Arctic 's hydrology during global warming at the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum . Nature , 442 , 671-675 . ] , which is a compound sourced by both conifer and angiosperm . Conspicuously , the angiosperm-sourced aromatic triterpane show a much larger CIE of 6 part per thousand and suggests that angiosperm increased in their carbon isotopic fractionation during the PETM . Our result thus indicate that the 4.5 part per thousand C ( 29 ) n-alkane CIE reported previously represents the average CIE of conifer and angiosperm at this site and suggest that the large and variable CIE observed in terrestrial record may be partly explained by the variable contribution of conifer and angiosperm . The differential response in isotopic fractionation of angiosperm and conifer point to different physiological response of these vegetation type to the rise in temperature , humidity , and greenhouse gas during the PETM .

aVLong-term energy security and global warming prevention can be achieved by a sustainable electricity supply with next generation fast breeder reactor ( FBRs ) . Current light water reactor ( LWRs ) will be replaced by FBRs and FBR cycle will be established in the future considering the limited amount of uranium ( U ) resource . The introduction of FBRs requires plutonium ( Pu ) recovered from LWR spent fuel . The author propose advanced system named `` Flexible Fuel Cycle Initiative ( FFCI ) '' which can supply enough Pu and hold no surplus Pu , can respond flexibly the future technical and social uncertainty , and can achieve an economical FBR cycle . FFCI can simplify the 2nd LWR reprocessing facility for Japan ( after Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant ) which only carry out U removal from LWR spent fuel . Residual `` Recycle Material '' is , according to FBRs introduction status , immediately treated in an FBR reprocessing to fabricate FBR fuel or temporarily stored for the utilization in FBRs at necessary timing . FFCI ha high flexibility by having several option for future uncertainty by the introduction of Recycle Material a a buffer material between LWR and FBR cycle .

aVEnergy crisis in the latter part of the 20th century , a well a the current increase in the cost of oil , emphasize the need for alternate source of energy in the United States . Concerns about climate change dictate that the source be clean and not contribute to global warming . Hydrogen ha been identified a such a source for many year and the transition to a hydrogen economy wa predicted to occur from the mid-1970s to 2000 . This paper report on the status of this transition in the year 2006 . Instead of being a clean source of energy , most of the hydrogen produced in the US result from steam reforming of fossil fuel , releasing CO2 and other pollutant to the atmosphere . Nuclear process heat is ideally suited for the production of hydrogen , either using electricity for electrolysis of water , or heat for thermochemical hydrogen production or reforming of fossil fuel . However , no new nuclear plant have been ordered or built in the United States since 1979 , and it may be many year before high-temperature nuclear reactor are available for production of hydrogen . Considerable research and development effort are focused on commercializing hydrogen-powered vehicle to lessen the dependence of the transportation sector on imported oil . However , the use of hydrogen fuel cell vehicle ( FCV ) in 2006 is two orders-of-magnitude le than what ha been predicted . Although it make little sense environmentally or economically , hydrogen is also used a fuel in internal combustion engine . Development of hydrogen economy will require a strong intervention by external force . ( C ) 2007 International Association for Hydrogen Energy . Published by Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVThe retreat of Arctic sea ice is a very likely consequence of climate change and part of a key feedback process , which can accelerate global warming . The uncertainty in prediction in the rate of sea ice retreat requires quantification and ultimately reduction via observational constraint . Here we analyse a climate model ensemble with perturbation to parameter in the atmosphere model . We find a large range of the sensitivity of Arctic sea-ice retreat to global temperature change , from 11 to 18 % per degree C. This is placed in the context of the uncertainty obtained by alternative model ensemble . Reasons for the different sensitivity are explored and we find that difference in the amount of ocean and atmospheric heat transported from low to high latitude dominates over local radiative contribution to the heat budget . Furthermore , we find no significant relationship between the uncertainty in sea ice response to climate change and climate sensitivity .

aVWe compare six high-resolution Holocene , sediment core along a S-N transect on the Norwegian-Svalbard continental margin from ca 60 degree N to 77.4 degree N , northern North Atlantic . Planktonic foraminifera in the core were investigated to show the change in upper surface and subsurface water mass distribution and property , including summer sea-surface temperature ( SST ) . The core are located below the axis of the Norwegian Current and the West Spitsbergen Current , which today transport warm Atlantic Water to the Arctic . Sediment accumulation rate are generally high at all the core site , allowing for a temporal resolution of 10-10 ( 2 ) year . SST is reconstructed using different type of transfer function , resulting in very similar SST trend , with deviation of no more than 1.0/1.5 degree C. A transfer function based on the maximum likelihood statistical approach is found to be most relevant . The reconstruction document an abrupt change in planktonic foraminiferal faunal composition and an associated warming at the Younger Dryas-Preboreal transition . The earliest part of the Holocene wa characterized by large temperature variability , including the Preboreal Oscillations and the 8.2 k event . In general , the early Holocene wa characterized by SSTs similar to those of today in the south and warmer than today in the north , and a smaller S-N temperature gradient ( 0.23 degree C/degrees N ) compared to the present temperature gradient ( 0.46 degree C/degrees N ) . The southern proxy record ( 60-69 degree N ) were more strongly influenced by slightly cooler subsurface water probably due to the seasonality of the orbital forcing and increased stratification due to freshening . The northern record ( 72-77.4 degree N ) display a millennial-scale change associated with reduced insolation and a gradual weakening of the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation ( THC ) . The observed northward amplification of the early Holocene warming is comparable to the pattern of recent global warming and future climate modelling , which predicts greater warming at higher latitude . The overall trend during mid and late Holocene wa a cooling in the north , stable or weak warming in the south , and a maximum S-N SST gradient of ca 0.7 degree C/degrees N at 5000 cal . year BP . Superimposed-on this trend were several abrupt temperature shift . Four of these shift , dated to 9000-8000 , 5500-3000 and 1000 and similar to 400 cal . year BP , appear to be global , a they correlate with period of global climate change . In general , there is a good correlation between the northern North Atlantic temperature record and climate record from Norway and Svalbard . ( c ) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVThe result presented here are from a study conducted for the government of the state of Andhra Pradesh ( GOAP ) in India , a part of a World Bank project on cyclone mitigation . A set of detailed map were prepared depicting the Physical Vulnerability ( PV ) , specifically storm surge inundation zone are shown for frequent occurrence , 50-year return period , likely scenario for global warming and extreme global warming . Similarly vulnerable area from strong wind field from tropical cyclone ( TCS ) are also presented for the same four parameter . Vulnerability zone are presented from a social point of view also based upon certain socio-economic parameter that were included in determining the overall vulnerability of each Mandal in a coastal district ( a Mandal represents a group of village and town ) include : population , senior citizen , woman , child under different age group , type of housing , income level , cyclone shelter , hospital and medical centre , school and caste based population . The study is about scenario that could happen if global warming and the predicted intensification of TCS actually occur a predicted by some numerical model .

aVThe high demand for water , the recent multiyear drought ( 1999 - 2007 ) , and projection of global warming have raised question about the long-term sustainability of water supply in the southwestern United States . In this study , the potential effect of specific level of atmospheric warming on water-year streamflow in the Colorado River basin are evaluated using a water-balance model , and the result are analyzed within the context of a multi-century tree-ring reconstruction ( 1490 - 1998 ) of streamflow for the basin . The result indicate that if future warming occurs in the basin and is not accompanied by increased precipitation , then the basin is likely to experience period of water supply shortage more severe than those inferred from the long-term historical tree-ring reconstruction . Furthermore , the modeling result suggest that future warming would increase the likelihood of failure to meet the water allocation requirement of the Colorado River Compact . Citation : McCabe , G.

aVAtmospheric brown cloud are mostly the result of biomass burning and fossil fuel consumption ( 1 ) . They consist of a mixture of light-absorbing and light-scattering aerosol ( 1 ) and therefore contribute to atmospheric solar heating and surface cooling . The sum of the two climate forcing terms-the net aerosol forcing effect is thought to be negative and may have masked a much a half of the global warming attributed to the recent rapid rise in greenhouse gas ( 2 ) . There is , however , at least a fourfold uncertainty ( 2 ) in the aerosol forcing effect . Atmospheric solar heating is a significant source of the uncertainty , because current estimate are largely derived from model study . Here we use three lightweight unmanned aerial vehicle that were vertically stacked between 0.5 and 3 km over the polluted Indian Ocean . These unmanned aerial vehicle deployed miniaturized instrument measuring aerosol concentration , soot amount and solar flux . During 18 flight mission the three unmanned aerial vehicle were flown with a horizontal separation of ten of metre or le and a temporal separation of le than ten second , which made it possible to measure the atmospheric solar heating rate directly . We found that atmospheric brown cloud enhanced lower atmospheric solar heating by about 50 per cent . Our general circulation model simulation , which take into account the recently observed widespread occurrence of vertically extended atmospheric brown cloud over the Indian Ocean and Asia ( 3 ) , suggest that atmospheric brown cloud contribute a much a the recent increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas to regional lower atmospheric warming trend . We propose that the combined warming trend of 0.25 K per decade may be sufficient to account for the observed retreat of the Himalayan glacier ( 4-6 ) .

aVMotivated by the high abatement cost of the Kyoto Protocol for Germany , this paper is estimating the economic impact of global warming on agriculture in that country . The hedonic approach is used a theoretical background . Stating that land price are - among others - determined by climatic factor , this approach can consequently be used to value global warming . To avoid a priori restriction stemming from functional form , the land price function is modeled a quadratic Box-Cox function that nest a wide range of specification . In a second step , the estimated result are used to forecast the impact of climate change . The result indicate that German farmer will be winner of climate change in the short run , with maximum gain occurring at a temperature increase of +0.6 degree C against current level . In the long run , there may be loss from global warming . However , the net present value from climate change is under the most probable scenario positive .

aVDepleting oil and gas reserve , combined with growing concern of global warming , have made it inevitable to seek energy from renewable energy source such a wind . The utilization of energy from wind is becoming increasingly attractive and is being widely used/disseminated for substitution of oil-produced energy , and eventually to minimize atmospheric degradation . Quantitative assessment of wind resource is an important driving element in successful establishment of a wind farm/park at a given location . More often than not , wind-energy resource are relatively better along coastline . In the present study , hourly mean wind-speed data of the period 1986-1997 recorded at the solar radiation and meteorological station , Dhahran ( 26 degree 32 ' N , 50 degree 13 ' E , eastern coastal plain of Saudi Arabia ) , have been analyzed to present different characteristic of wind speed in considerable depth such a : yearly , monthly , diurnal variation of wind speed , etc . The long-term monthly average wind speed for Dhahran range from 4.2-6.4 m/s . More importantly , the study deal with impact of hub height on wind energy generation . Attention ha also been focussed on monthly average daily energy generation from different size of commercially available wind machine ( 150 , 250 , 600 kW ) to identify optimum wind machine size from energy production point of view . It ha been found that for a given 6 MW wind farm size , at 50 m hub height , cluster of 150 kW wind machine yield about 48 % more energy a compared to 600 kW wind machine . Literature show that commercial/residential building in Saudi Arabia consume an estimated 10-40 % of the total electric energy generated . So , concurrently , a a case study , attempt ha been made to investigate/ examine the potential of utilizing hybrid ( wind+diesel ) energy conversion system to meet the load requirement of hundred typical 2-bedroom residential building ( with annual electrical energy demand of 3512 MWh ) . The hybrid system considered in the present case-study consist of different combination of wind machine ( of various capacity ) , supplemented with battery storage and diesel back-up . The deficit energy generated from the back-up diesel generator and the number of operational hour of the diesel system to meet a specific annual electrical energy demand of 3512 MWh have also been presented . The diesel back-up system is operated at time when the power generated from wind energy conversion system ( WECS ) fails to satisfy the load and when the battery storage is depleted . The evaluation of hybrid system show that with seven 150 kW WECS and three day of battery storage , the diesel back-up system ha to provide 17.5 % of the load demand . However , in absence of battery storage , about 37 % of the load need to be provided by the diesel system .

aVBecause of their vast size , grazing land have the potential to sequester significant quantity of carbon , slowing the increase in atmospheric CO , and reducing the risk of global warming . Although CO2 uptake during the growing season can be substantial , loss during winter month reduce annual sequestration , potentially turning grazing land into net carbon source . The goal of this research wa to quantify the magnitude of winter flux for humid-temperate pasture in the northeastern USA . The study wa conducted from 2003 to 2005 on two pasture in the ridge and valley region of central Pennsylvania , one dominated by a mix of cool-season grass and the other transitioning from an alfalfa to mixed-grass pasture . Pasture-scale CO2 flux were quantified using eddy covariance technique . The alfalfa pasture wa le of a CO2 source to the atmosphere during winter month ( 1 December to 31 March ) than the grass pasture , averaging 2.68 g CO2 m ( -2 ) day ( -1 ) compared with 3.09 g CO2 m ( -2 ) day ( -1 ) for the grass pasture . Cumulative efflux for the winter month averaged 326 g CO2 m ( -2 ) ( 88 g C m ( -2 ) ) for the alfalfa and 375 g CO2 m ( -2 ) ( 101 g C m ( -2 ) ) for the grass pasture . In the absence of snow cover , eddy covariance measurement estimated that photosynthetic CO2 , uptake occurred at temperature below 0 degree C. Canopy and leaf chamber measurement in the field and in controlled environment suggested minimum temperature for photosynthetic CO2 uptake of about -4 degree C. Even when daytime uptake occurred , nighttime efflux from the system wa greater so that the pasture remained CO2 source throughout the winter . Published by Elsevier B.V .

aVWood density is an important variable in estimate of forest biomass and greenhouse-gas emission from land-use change . The mean wood density used in estimate of forest biomass in the Brazilian Amazon ha heretofore been based on sample from outside the `` arc of deforestation '' , where most of the carbon flux from land-use change take place . This paper present new wood density estimate for the southern and southwest Brazilian Amazon ( SSWA ) portion of the arc of deforestation , using locally collected specie weighted by their volume in large local inventory . Mean wood density wa computed for the entire bole , including the bark , and taking into account radial and longitudinal variation . A total of 403 tree were sampled at 6 site . In the southern Brazilian Amazon ( SBA ) , 225 tree ( 119 specie or morpho-species ) were sampled at 4 site . In eastern Acre state 178 tree ( 128 specie or morpho-species ) were sampled at breast height in 2 forest type . Mean basic density in the SBA site wa 0.593 +/- 0.113 ( mean +/- 1 S.D . ; n = 225 ; range 0.265-0.825 ) . For the tree sampled in Acre the mean wood density at breast height wa 0.540 +/- 0.149 ( n = 87 ) in open bamboo-dominated forest and 0.619 +/- 0.149 ( n = 91 ) in dense bamboo-free forest . Mean wood density in the SBA site wa significantly higher than in the bamboo dominated forest but not the dense forest at the Acre site . From commercial wood inventory by the RadamBrasil Project in the SSWA portion of the arc of deforestation , the wood volume and wood density of each specie or genus were used to estimate average wood density of all wood volume in each vegetation unit . These unit were defined by the intersection of mapped forest type and state . The area of each unit wa then used to compute a mean wood density of 0.583 g cm ( -3 ) for all wood volume in the SSWA . This is 13.6 % lower than the value applied to this region in previous estimate of mean wood density . When combined with the new estimate for the SSWA , this gave an average wood density of 0.642 g cm ( -3 ) for all the wood volume in the entire Brazilian Amazon , which is 7 % le than a priorestimate of 0.69 g cm ( -3 ) . These result suggest that current estimate of carbon emission from land-use change in the Brazilian Amazon are too high . The impact on biomass estimate and carbon emission is substantial because the downward adjustment is greater in forest type undergoing the most deforestation . For 1990 , with 13.8 x 10 ( 3 ) km ( 2 ) of deforestation , emission for the Brazilian Amazon would be reduced by 23.4-24.4 x 10 ( 6 ) Mg CO2-equivalent C/year ( for high- and low-trace gas scenario ) , or 9.4-9.5 % of the gross emission and 10.7 % of the net committed emission , both excluding soil .

aVA conceptual model of the salinity distribution in the oceanic Hadley cell is presented . The model pertains to the region of tropical easterly surface wind , where the surface salinity increase poleward from a local salinity minimum near the equator to a subtropical salinity maximum . A fundamental constraint is that the meridional freshwater transport in the atmosphere and the ocean have the same magnitude but opposite direction . A key assumption is that the strength of the meridional overturning cell in the atmosphere and the ocean is proportional and set by the surface layer Ekman transport . It is further assumed that , to the lowest order of approximation , the zonal-mean Ekman transport accomplish the meridional freshwater transport , that is , eddy flux and gyre-induced transport are ignored . The model predicts that the salinity variation in the oceanic cell is directly proportional to the specific humidity of the near-surface air , but independent of the meridional mass transport ( a long a the atmospheric and oceanic mass transport remain proportional ) . If the relative humidity of the near-surface air is constant , the salinity variation in the oceanic Hadley cell varies essentially with the surface temperature according to the Clausius-Clapeyron expression for the saturation vapor pressure . Further , the model is compared to observation and a global warming simulation and found to give a leading-order description of the tropical surface salinity range .

aVThe Saltuarius swaini lineage comprises four specie : S. swaini ( Wells & Wellington , 1985 ) , S. wyberba ( Couper et al. , 1997 ) , S. moritzi n.sp . and S. kateae n.sp . These are diagnosed by scalation and colour pattern difference ; high level of discrimination between these specie were obtained in genetic and multivariate morphological analysis . Two specie , Saltuarius swaini and S. wyberba , occur in both southeastern Queensland and northeastern N.S.W . The former is a rainforest obligate , the latter saxicolous . Saltuarius moritzi and S. kateae n.spp . are restricted to northeastern N.S.W . The former is widespread and the least specific in geological and substrate association . The latter is restricted to the Mt Marsh area . The genus ha a rainforest ancestry . Divergence within the `` S. swaini '' lineage may date to the latest Eocene-Early Miocene . We hypothesize that population of ancestral leaf-tailed gecko would have been severely fragmented since the Mid Tertiary forcing retreat to rainforest refugia and driving allopatric speciation . Some population shifted from tree to rock . All four taxon are well-represented in existing reserve . Saltuarius swaini , a specie with a continuous rainforest history and low level of genetic variation , may be disadvantaged by ecological stasis in the face of global warming .

aVSimple equation are developed to express regional climate change for the twenty-first century and associated uncertainty in term of the global temperature change ( GTC ) without a dependence on the underlying emission pathway . The equation are applied to regional temperature and precipitation change over different region of the world , and relevant parameter are calculated using the latest multimodel ensemble of global climate change simulation . Examples are also shown of how to use the equation to develop probability density function ( PDFs ) of regional climate change based on PDFs of GTC . The main advantage of these equation is that they can be used to estimate regional change from GTC obtained either from simple and intermediate complexity model or from target CO. stabilization concentration .

aVChanges of the Sulfate product and optical coefficient during the heterogeneous reaction of SO ( 2 ) on the surface of hematite at different temperature were investigated using in situ diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( DFTIRS ) , ion chromatogram ( IC ) , and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) . Simulations revealed that within the ambient temperature of 15-45 degree C , the yield and velocity of sulfate product , absorption coefficient , and backward scattering coefficient firstly increased at 15-35 degree C and then decreased at 35-45 degree C. At persistent temperature , the velocity of sulfate production showed an initial increase followed by a decrease and finally stabilized . There wa a high exponential correlation between the optical coefficient and the amount of sulfate product generated . This result is important in understanding the heterogeneous reaction of SO ( 2 ) on the surface of hematite in the environment and the assessment of this reaction 's impact on sulfate production and radiative forcing , considering the phenomenon of global warming .

aVMangrove forest are found within the intertropical zone and are one of the most biodiverse and productive wetland on Earth . We focus oil the Cienaga Grande de Santa Marta ( CGSM ) in Colombia , the largest coastal lagoon-delta ecosystem in the Caribbean area with an extension of 1280 kin 2 , where one of the largest mangrove rehabilitation project in Latin America is currently underway . Extensive man-made hydrological modification in the region caused hypersaline soil ( > 90 g kg ( -1 ) ) condition since the 1960s triggering a large dieback of mangrove wetland ( similar to 247 km ( 2 ) ) . In this paper , we describe a new systematic methodology to measure mangrove height and aboveground biomass by remote sensing . The method is based on SRTM ( Shuttle Radar Topography Mission ) elevation data , ICEsat/GLAS waveform ( Ice , Cloud , and Land Elevation Satellite/Geoscience Laser Altimeter System ) and field data . Since the location of the ICEsat and field datasets do not coincide , they are used independently to calibrate SRTM elevation and produce a map of mangrove canopy height . We compared height estimation method based on waveform centroid and the canopy height profile ( CHP ) . Linear relationship between ICEsat height estimate and SRTM elevation were derived . We found the centroid of the canopy waveform contribution ( CWC ) to be the best height estimator . The field data wa used to estimate a SRTM canopy height bias ( -1.3 m ) and estimation error ( rms = 1.9 m ) . The relationship wa applied to the SRTM elevation data to produce a mangrove canopy height map . Finally , we used field data and published allometric equation to derive an empirical relationship between canopy height and biomass . This relationship wa used to scale the mangrove height map and estimate aboveground biomass distribution for the entire CGSM . The mean mangrove canopy height in CGSM is 7.7 m and most of the biomass is concentrated in forest around 9 m in height . Our biomass map will enable estimation of regeneration rate of mangrove forest under hydrological rehabilitation at large spatial scale over the next decade . They will also be used to ass how highly disturbed mangrove forest respond to increasing sea level rise under current global climate change scenario . ( C ) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All right reserved .

aVGlobal climate change mitigation requires the fossil fuel consumption substantially reduced . Space heating is an energy-consuming sector Despite the fact that the thermal efficiency of current space heating system ha achieved a value higher than 85 % , corresponding to lower than 40 kg c.e./G.J , there is still a big potential for energy conservation . In order to realize the full potential , investigation of heating system should appeal to reversibility/exergy analysis made on total energy concept basis . This paper start with an introduction of the concept `` reversible mode . of heating , leading the reader think of space heating in term of reversibility . Right after , a systematic reversibility analysis on a `` mine to home '' basis is conducted to reveal the impact of any irreversibility of all subsystem or device involved in the total energy system of heating on the fuel/monetary specific consumption of unit end-use heat . The paper point out that although combined heat and power ( CHP ) and electrically driven heat pump are both of `` reversible mode , the former is far more favorable in term of energy conservation . The recently ascent decentralized energy system provides the best circumstance for CHP implementation . The demand-side improvement is a topic of most importance but frequently neglected . This study reveals that . if properly engineered , this improvement together with adopting a direct type of heat grid might lower the fuel specific consumption of end-use heat of CHP to a level a low a 13-9 kg c.e./GJ .

aVConversion of CO2 into methanol by catalytic hydrogenation ha been recognized a one of the most promising process for stabilizing the atmospheric CO2 level , and furthermore the methanol produced could be used a fuel or basic chemical for satisfying the large demand world-wide . The present work investigates a two-stage catalyst bed concept for conversion of CO2 to methanol . A system with two catalyst bed instead of one single catalyst bed is developed for conversion of CO2 to methanol . in the first catalyst bed , the synthesis gas is partly converted to methanol in a conventional water-cooled reactor . This bed operates at higher than normal operating temperature and at high yield . in the second bed , the reaction heat is used to pre-heat the feed gas to the first bed . The continuously reduced temperature in this bed provides increasing thermodynamic equilibrium potential . in this bed , the reaction rate is much lower and , consequently , so is the amount of the reaction heat . This feature result in milder temperature profile in the second bed because le heat is liberated compared to the first bed . In this way the catalyst are exposed to le extreme temperature and , catalyst deactivation via sintering is circumvented . In this work , a one-dimensional dynamic plug flow dynamic is used to analyze and compare the performance of two-stage bed and conventional single bed reactor . The result of this work show that the two-stage catalyst bed system can be operated with higher conversion and longer catalyst life time . ( C ) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All right reserved .

aVThe millennium ecosystem assessment report on global assessment of desertification ha highlighted it worldwide impact on the environment-increasing dust storm , flood and global warming-as well a on society and economy . It link sustainable management of resource , and inter alia well-being of dryland population , to reducing societal pressure on dryland ecosystem through adoption of alternative livelihood . This paper , in combination with a companion paper by Safriel and Adeel , present the conceptual underpinnings of this approach a well a example of how innovative approach for creating livelihood can help reduce the pressure on marginal drylands . Three case study presented are based on activity undertaken within a joint international project called sustainable management of marginal drylands . First , introduction of chicken farming to farmer in Hunshundake Sandland in northern China ha reduced the pressure on grassland and led to a major recovery of these ecosystem . Second , development of desert-based aquaculture , with accompanied longer-term storage of water , on the margin of the Cholistan desert in Pakistan ha provided a new source of income for the villager . Third , development of a new income-generating activity based on soap production from olive oil in Dana Biosphere Reserve in Jordan ha demonstrated that traditional olive farming can be linked to community-based innovation to create a new , high-demand market for good . Working with community to develop new , sustainable livelihood that reduce pressure on marginal drylands can thus be used a powerful tool for overcoming and reversing desertification .

aVAdvancement of spring migration in response to recent global climate change is well documented for a variety of bird specie , but the pattern for autumn migration is rather equivocal . During a 42-year period ( 1964-2005 ) the change in timing of spring and autumn migration of eight wader specie were Studied at Multiple inland site in Central Europe ( Czech Republic and Slovakia ) using ringing data . While a clear pattern wa found for the advancement of the spring passage , there were variable trend in the timing of the autumn passage . Three specie significantly advanced ( Wood Sandpiper , Common Sandpiper and Dunlin ) , three specie delayed ( Ruff , Snipe and Little Ringed Plover ) , and two specie did not change the timing of the autumn passage ( Little Stint and Green Sandpiper ) . Earlier study had predicted that long-distance migrant wintering South of the Sahara Would advance the timing of autumn migration , while short-distance migrant would postpone it . However , our finding do not fully conform to these prediction . Across specie , the timing of both the spring and autumn passage wa negatively associated with the winter North Atlantic Oscillation ( NAO ) index , suggesting that even in long-distance migrant the timing of migration might be under direct environmental control . In conclusion , phenological response of bird to recent change in climate are quite coherent for the early phenological phase ; however , the response to later phase are not so straightforward , and the present study contributes to this diverse pattern .

aVAmazonian forest produce environmental service such a maintenance of biodiversity , water cycling and carbon stock . These service have a much greater value to human society than do the timber , beef and other product that are obtained by destroying the forest . Yet institutional mechanism are still lacking to transform the value of the standing forest into the foundation of an economy based on maintaining rather than destroying this ecosystem . Forest management for commodity such a timber and non-timber forest product face severe limitation and inherent contradiction unless income is supplemented based on environmental service . Amazon forest is threatened by deforestation , logging , forest fire and climate change . Measures to avoid deforestation include repression through command and control , creation of protected area , and reformulation of infrastructure decision and development policy . An economy primarily based on the value of environmental service is essential for long-term maintenance of the forest . Much progress ha been made in the decade since I first proposed such a transition , but many issue also remain unresolved . These include theoretical issue regarding accounting procedure , improved quantification of the service and of the benefit of different policy option , and effective us of the fund generated in way that maintain both the forest and the human population .

aVThis paper explores how South American farmer adapt to climate by changing crop . We develop a multinomial logit model of farmer 's choice of crop . Estimating the model across 949 farmer in seven country , we find that both temperature and precipitation affect the crop that South American farmer choose . Farmers choose fruit and vegetable in warmer location and wheat and potato in cooler location . Farms in wetter location are more likely to grow rice , fruit , potato , and squash and in dryer location maize and wheat . Global warming will cause South American farmer to switch away from maize , wheat , and potato towards squash , fruit and vegetable . Predictions of the impact of climate change on net revenue must reflect not only change in yield per crop but also crop switching . ( C ) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All right reserved .

aVThe response of the Asian-African summer monsoon ( AASM ) to the fast global warming in the 1980s is studied based oil several datasets , which span a long time period of nearly 100 yr , with two special period 1980-1985 and 1990-1995 being focused on . Wavelet analysis are employed to explore the interdecadal variation of the AASM . It is found that after the mid-1980s , the global annual mean surface temperature rise more significantly and extensively over most part of the African Continent , north of the Indian Ocean , and the Eurasian Continent excluding the Tibetan Plateau . Correspondingly , the global precipitation pattern alters with increased rainfall seen over the Sahel and North China in 1990-1995 , though it is not recovered to the level of the rainy period before the mid-1960s . Changes of monsoonal circulation between the pre- and post-1980s period display that , after the fast global warming of the 1980s , the African summer monsoon intensifies distinctly , the Indian summer monsoon weakens a little bit , and the East Asian summer monsoon remains almost unchanged . The summer precipitation over the Asian-African Monsoon Belt ( AAMB ) doe not change in phase coherently with the variation of the monsoonal circulation . Wavelet analysis of the land-sea thermal contrast and precipitation over North China and the Sahel indicate that interdecadal signal are dominant and in positive phase in the 1960s , leading to an overall enhanced interdecadal variation of the AASM , although the 1960s witness a global cooling . In the 1980s however , in the context of a fast global warming , interdecadal signal are in opposite phase , and they counteract with each other , leading to a weakened interdecadal variation of the AASM . After the mid-1960s , the AASM weakened remarkably , whereas after the mid-1980s , the AASM a a whole did not strengthen uniformly and synchronously , because it is found that the interannual variation of the AASM in the 1980s are stronger than those in the 1960s , and they superimposed on the counteracting interdecadal signal , causing different region of the AAMB behaving differently . Therefore , the response of the AASM to the accelerated global warming post the mid-1980s is not simply out-of-phase with that after the mid-1960s ; it may involve more complicated multiscale physical element .

aVA combination of reconstructed history , long-term time series and recent quasi-continuous observation of non-CO2 greenhouse gas at the high-Alpine site Jungfraujoch is used to ass their current global radiative forcing budget and the influence of regulation due to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer in term of climate change . Extrapolated atmospheric greenhouse gas trend from 1989 assuming a business-as-usualscenario , i.e . no Montreal Protocol restriction , are presented and compared to the observation . The largest difference between hypothetical business-as-usual mixing ratio and current atmospheric observation over the last 16 year were found for chlorinated specie , in particular methyl chloroform ( CH3CCl3 ) at 167 to 203 ppt and chlorofluorocarbon-12 ( CFC-12 ) at 121 to 254 ppt . These prevented increase were used to estimate the effect of their restriction on the radiative forcing budget . The net direct effect due to the Montreal Protocol regulation reduces global warming and offset about 14 to 30 % of the positive greenhouse effect related to the major greenhouse gas CO2 , CH4 , N2O and also SF6 , and about 12 to 22 % of the hypothetical current radiative forcing increase without Montreal Protocol restriction . Thus , the Montreal Protocol succeeded not only in reducing the atmospheric chlorine content in the atmosphere but also dampened global warming . Nevertheless , the Montreal Protocol controlled specie still add to global warming . ( c ) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All right reserved .

aVThe classical substance a hydrochlorofluorocarbon ( HCFCs ) used a working fluid in the vapour compression plant have to be replaced by new substance because of their ozone depletion potential and their greenhouse effect . Carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) is non-toxic , non-flammable , ha zero ozone depletion potential and negligible global warming potential a refrigerant . Referring to a transcritical CO2 cycle working a a classical `` split-system '' to cool air in residential application , the aim of this paper is the evaluation of the energy performance using an internal heat exchanger . The experimental plant employ a semi-hermetic compressor , plate-finned tube type heat exchanger , a back pressure valve electronically controlled and an expansion valve . Besides it is possible to control the flash gas produced in the liquid receiver thanks to another semi-hermetic compressor linked to an inverter . An increase of the coefficient of performance ha been found using the internal heat exchanger . The comparison of the coefficient of performance of two cycle , working with and without the internal heat exchanger , is discussed . ( C ) 2008 Elsevier Ltd and IIR . All right reserved .

aVOne of file most significant anticipated consequence of global climate change is the change in Frequency of hydrological extreme . Predictions of climate change impact oil the regime of hydrological extreme have traditionally been conducted by a top-down approach that involves a high degree of uncertainty associated with the temporal and spatial characteristic of general circulation model ( GCM ) Outputs and the choice of downscaling technique . This Study us the inverse approach to model hydrological risk and Vulnerability to changing climate condition in the Seyhan River basin , Turkey . With close collaboration with the end user , the approach first identifies critical hydrological exposure that may lead to local failure in the Seyhan River basin . The Hydro-BEAM hydrological model is used to inversely transform the main hydrological exposure , such a flood and drought , into corresponding meteorological condition . The frequency of critical meteorological condition is investigated under present and future climate scenario by mean of a weather generator based oil the improved K-nearest neighbour algorithm , The weather generator , linked with the Output of GCMS in the last step of the proposed methodology , allows for the creation of all ensemble of scenario and easy Updating when improved GCM Outputs become available . Two main conclusion were drawn from the application of the inverse approach to the Seyhan River basin . First , flood of 100- , 200- and 300-year return period under present condition will have 102- , 293- and 1370-year return period under the future condition ; that is , critical flood event will occur much le frequently under the changing climate condition . Second , the drought return period will change from 5.3 year under present condition to 2.0 year tinder the future condition that is , critical drought event will occur Much more frequently under the changing climate condition .

aVThis paper analysis the insulation characteristic of c-C ( 4 ) F ( 8 ) /CO ( 2 ) gas mixture using the Monte Carlo method with the null-collision technique and study the possibility of applying that in the gas insulation of power equipment . The density-normalized effective ionization coefficient ( alpha-eta ) /N for c-C ( 4 ) F ( 8 ) /CO ( 2 ) gas mixture ha been calculated using a sample of a pulsed Townsend discharge . The overall density-reduced electric field strength ( E/N ) could be varied between 150 and 450 Td ( 1 Td = 10 ( -17 ) Vcm ( 2 ) ) , while the c-C ( 4 ) F ( 8 ) content in the gas mixture is varied over the range 0-100 % . From the variation curve of ( alpha-eta ) /N with the c-C ( 4 ) F ( 8 ) mixture ratio k , the limiting field ( E/N ) ( lim ) of the gas mixture at different gas content is determined . The required gas pressure ratio comparable to the insulation property of SF ( 6 ) and the global warming potential ( GWP ) at this gas pressure were also investigated . It is found that the limiting field ( E/N ) lim of the c-C ( 4 ) F ( 8 ) /CO ( 2 ) gas mixture is higher than that of SF ( 6 ) /CO ( 2 ) gas mixture , and the GWP of the former is significantly lower than that of the latter .

aVIn this study , using 104 year ( 1901 - 2004 ) of high resolution daily gridded rainfall data , variability and long-term trend of extreme rainfall event over central India have been examined . Frequency of extreme rainfall event show significant inter-annual and inter-decadal variation in addition to a statistically significant long term trend of 6 % per decade . Detailed analysis show that inter-annual , inter-decadal and long-term trend of extreme rainfall event are modulated by the SST variation over the tropical Indian Ocean . The present study support the hypothesis that the increasing trend of extreme rainfall event in the last five decade could be associated with the increasing trend of sea surface temperature and surface latent heat flux over the tropical Indian Ocean . In the global warming scenario , the coherent relationship between Indian Ocean SST and extreme rainfall event suggests an increase in the risk of major flood over central India .

aVMapping land use/land cover ( LULC ) change at regional scale is essential for a wide range of application , including landslide , erosion , land planning , global warming etc . LULC alteration ( based especially on human activity ) , negatively effect the pattern of climate , the pattern of natural hazard and socio-economic dynamic in global and local scale . In this study , LULC change are investigated by using of Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems ( GIS ) in Rize , North-East Turkey . For this purpose , firstly supervised classification technique is applied to Landsat image acquired in 1976 and 2000 . Image Classification of six reflective band of two Landsat image is carried out by using maximum likelihood method with the aid of ground truth data obtained from aerial image dated 1973 and 2002 . The second part focused on land use land cover change by using change detection comparison ( pixel by pixel ) . In third part of the study , the land cover change are analyzed according to the topographic structure ( slope and altitude ) by using GIS function . The result indicate that severe land cover change have occurred in agricultural ( 36.2 % ) ( especially in tea garden ) , urban ( 117 % ) , pasture ( -72.8 % ) and forestry ( -12.8 % ) area ha been experienced in the region between 1976 and 2000 . It wa seen that the LULC change were mostly occurred in coastal area and in area having low slope value .

aVMethanotrophs in the rhizosphere play an important role in global climate change since they attenuate methane emission from rice field ecosystem into the atmosphere . Most of the CH4 is emitted via transport through the plant gas vascular system . We used this transport for stable isotope probing ( SIP ) of the methanotrophs in the rhizosphere under field condition and pulse-labelled rice plant in a Chinese rice field with CH4 ( 99 % C-13 ) for 7 day . The rate of ( CH4 ) -C-13 loss rate during C-13 application wa comparable to the CH4 oxidation rate measured by the difluoromethane inhibition technique . The methanotrophic community on the root and in the rhizospheric soil were analyzed by terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism ( T-RFLP ) , cloning and sequencing of the particulate methane monooxygenase ( pmoA ) gene . Populations of type I methanotrophs were larger than those of type II . Both methane oxidation rate and composition of methanotrophic community suggested that there wa little difference between urea-fertilized and unfertilized field . SIP of phospholipid fatty acid ( PLFA-SIP ) and rRNA ( RNA-SIP ) were used to analyze the metabolically active methanotrophic community in rhizospheric soil . PLFA of type I compared with type II methanotrophs wa labelled more strongly with C-13 , reaching a maximum of 6.8 atom- % . T-RFLP analysis and cloning/sequencing of 16S rRNA gene showed that methanotrophs , especially of type I , were slightly enriched in the 'heavy ' fraction . Our result indicate that CH4 oxidation in the rice rhizosphere under in situ condition is mainly due to type I methanotrophs .

aVRecent scientific finding , a presented in the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment ( ACIA ) , indicate that climate change in the Arctic is happening now , at a faster rate than elsewhere in the world , and with major implication for people of the Arctic ( especially indigenous people ) and the rest of the planet . This paper examines scientific and political representation of Arctic indigenous people that have been central to the production and articulation of these claim . ACIA employ novel form and strategy of representation that reflect changing conceptual model and practice of global change science and depict indigenous people a expert , exotic , and at-risk . These portrayal emerge alongside the growing political activism of Arctic indigenous people who present themselves a representative or embodiment of climate change itself a they advocate for climate change mitigation policy . These mutually constitutive form of representation suggest that scientific way of seeing the global environment shape and are shaped by the public image and voice of global citizen . Likewise , the authority , credibility , and visibility of Arctic indigenous activist derive , in part , from their status a at-risk expert , a status buttressed by new scientific framework and method that recognize and rely on the local experience and knowledge of indigenous people . Analyses of these relationship linking scientific and political representation of Arctic climate change build upon science and technology study ( STS ) scholarship on visualization , challenge conventional notion of globalization , and raise question about power and accountability in global climate change research .

aVFiddler crab , Uca pugnax , were collected from a highly contaminated site and a relatively clean site , both in New Jersey to determine if and how environment with varying level of pollutant may impact aspect of population biology including individual size , morphology ( major cheliped size ) , population density , fecundity , recruitment and survivorship of early benthic phase . Crabs from the highly contaminated site were significantly larger in size , but had lower population density , lower recruitment , reduced reproductive season and lower survivorship of early benthic phase . Our study suggests that contamination may play a role in population ecology of U. pugnax . This study also determined that the reproductive season for U. pugnax in New Jersey is much longer than reported in the literature and could potentially be impacted by global climate change .

aVDifferent component of global environmental change are typically studied and managed independently , although there is a growing recognition that multiple driver often interact in complex and nonadditive way . We present a conceptual framework and empirical review of the interactive effect of climate change and invasive specie in freshwater ecosystem , Climate change is expected to result in warmer water temperature , shorter duration of ice cover , altered streamflow pattern , increased salinization , and increased demand for water storage and conveyance structure . These change will alter the pathway by which non-native specie enter aquatic system by expanding fish-culture facility and water garden to new area and by facilitating the spread of specie during flood . Climate change will influence the likelihood of new specie becoming established by eliminating cold temperature or winter hypoxia that currently prevent survival and by increasing the construction of reservoir that serve a hotspot for invasive specie . Climate change will modify the ecological impact of invasive specie by enhancing their competitive and predatory effect on native specie and by increasing the virulence of some disease . As a result of climate change , new prevention and control strategy such a barrier construction or removal effort may be needed to control invasive specie that currently have only moderate effect or that are limited by seasonally unfavorable condition , Although most researcher focus on how climate change will increase the number and severity of invasion , some invasive coldwater specie may be unable to persist under the new climate condition . Our finding highlight the complex interaction between climate change and invasive specie that will influence how aquatic ecosystem and their biota will respond to novel environmental condition .

aVUrea and organic manure such a 'Garden galore ' ( GG ) are used to supply nitrogen ( N ) in vegetable farming and floriculture system in New Zealand . However , a significant amount of the applied N is lost to the atmosphere via nitrous oxide ( N ( 2 ) O ) and ammonia ( NH ( 3 ) ) emission , and leached to surface and ground water a nitrate ( NO ( 3 ) ( - ) ) contributing to environmental degradation such a global warming and eutrophication . One of the mitigation option to reduce these loss is to use nitrification inhibitor ( NI ) . Glasshouse and laboratory incubation experiment were conducted under controlled moisture and temperature condition to determine the effect of an NI , dicyandiamide ( DCD ) , on N loss from urea and GG applied to lettuce grown in a Manawatu sandy soil . Nitrogen and DCD were applied at the rate of 9 and 1.3 g/m ( 2 ) , respectively , and the gaseous emission of N ( 2 ) O and NH ( 3 ) were monitored over a 5-week period using a closed-chamber technique . At the end of the experiment the lettuce plant shoot and root were harvested , and analysed for N concentration . Soils were leached with deionised water and leachates were analysed for ammonium ( NH ( 4 ) ( + ) ) and NO ( 3 ) ( - ) . The result showed greater loss of N a NH ( 3 ) than N ( 2 ) O and the effect wa more pronounced in the case of urea . Addition of DCD significantly reduced N ( 2 ) O emission from both urea and GG , and increased NH ( 3 ) emission from both urea and GG , with the increase being significant only for urea . Addition of DCD maintained higher soil NH ( 4 ) ( + ) concentration and lower NO ( 3 ) ( - ) concentration than without DCD . Overall , DCD wa effective in reducing N loss of N ( 2 ) O emission and NO ( 3 ) leaching . Urea application resulted in shoot tip burning and the symptom were enhanced with the addition of DCD . There wa no significant effect of DCD addition on lettuce yield .

aVEffective conservation requires rigorous baseline of pristine condition to ass the impact of human activity and to evaluate the efficacy of management . Most coral reef are moderately to severely degraded by local human activity such a fishing and pollution a well a global change , hence it is difficult to separate local from global effect . To this end , we surveyed coral reef on uninhabited atoll in the northern Line Islands to provide a baseline of reef community structure , and on increasingly populated atoll to document change associated with human activity . We found that top predator and reef-building organism dominated unpopulated Kingman and Palmyra , while small planktivorous fish and fleshy algae dominated the populated atoll of Tabuaeran and Kiritimati . Sharks and other top predator overwhelmed the fish assemblage on Kingman and Palmyra so that the biomass pyramid wa inverted ( top-heavy ) . In contrast , the biomass pyramid at Tabuaeran and Kiritimati exhibited the typical bottom-heavy pattern . Reefs without people exhibited le coral disease and greater coral recruitment relative to more inhabited reef . Thus , protection from overfishing and pollution appears to increase the resilience of reef ecosystem to the effect of global warming .

aVOn Tahiti , invasive specie such a the carnivorous snail Euglandina rosea or the tree Miconia calvescens ; have impacted much of indigenous specie or habitat , even in remote place not affected by agriculture or development . However , thanks to the extreme ecological condition in altitude , these invasive specie have not reached higher elevation where patch of native vegetation with endemic flora and fauna still occur . On Mount Aorai , second highest peak of Tahiti ( 2066 m ) , the impact of Euglandina rosea and Miconia calvescens reach a maximum altitude of 1400 m. Above this altitude , endemic gastropod specie are still found alive and some remain undescribed . A new genus of Vertiginidae , Nesoropupa n . gn. , is described for four new specie from the top 500 m of Mount Aorai and Mount Marau : N. duodecim n. sp . ( type specie ) , N. fenua n . sp. , N. nathaliae n. sp . and N. fontainei n. sp . Also discussed is how the impact of global warming is allowing introduced specie to colonize higher altitude up to the summit .

aVBiofuels are important because they span three of the greatest issue of our time-world industrial development ; energy security and the transition to a bioeconomy ; and global warming . Biofuels have something important to contribute a a solution in each of these three areas-without being a 'magic bullet ' or the whole of the solution in any of them . Indeed , biofuels may be a transitory solution that will phase out after two or three decade a new electric-powered transport system take over . But in the meantime , biofuels have the potential to bring together North and South in a new Biopact of transcendent significance , promising to allow country of the South to lift themselves out of poverty through biofuel cultivation , processing and export ; and country of the North to solve their transport and global warming problem by opening up to biofuels produced sustainably and responsibly from the tropical South . A goal of 2000 biorefineries over the course of the next decade is entirely realistic : their output would be of the order of 400 billion liter of ethanol and/or biodiesel , or about one fifth of OECD country ' current transport fuel requirement . The investment required would be of the order of US $ 240 billion over a decade compared with the more than $ 470 billion expected by the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) to be invested in the oil and gas industry in a single year by 2010 . In this light , the investment required is modest . Such an investment can only be undertaken if market in the North are guaranteed . The best mean of achieving such an investment-grade guarantee is through a comprehensive global trade agreement . But the prospect for such an agreement are vitiated by the cacophony of opposition to biofuels raised in the North , by non-governmental organization ( NGOs ) and vested interest , who are raising hysterical concern over the transition from fossil fuel to biofuels , and stand accused of seeking industrial protection under the guise of environmental concern .

aVMethane fermentation ha been in practice over a century for the stabilization of high strength organic waste/waste water . Although methanogenesis is a well established process and methane -the end-product of methanogenesis is a useful energy source ; it is a low value end product with relatively le energy content ( about 56 kJ energy per g CH4 ) . Besides , methane and it combustion by-product are powerful greenhouse gas , and responsible for global climate change .

aVPast study of bird migration time have shown great variation in migratory response to climate change . We used 33 year of bird capture data ( 1970-2002 ) from Manomet , Massachusetts to examine variation in spring migration time for 32 specie of North American passerine . We found that change in first arrival date - the unit of observation used in most study of bird migration time - often differ dramatically from change in the mean arrival date of the migration cohort a a whole . In our study , the earliest recorded springtime arrival date for each specie occurred 0.20 day later each decade . In contrast , the mean arrival date for bird of each specie occurred 0.78 day earlier each decade . The difference in the two trend wa largely explained by declining migration cohort size , a factor not examined in many previous study . We found that change in migration cohort or population size may account for a substantial amount of the variation in previously documented change in migration time . After controlling for change in migration cohort size , we found that climate variable , migration distance , and date of migration explained portion of the variation in migratory change over time . In particular , short-distance migrant appeared to respond to change in temperature , while mid-distance migrant responded particularly strongly to change in the Southern Oscillation Index . The migration time of long-distance migrant tended not to change over time . Our finding suggest that previously reported change in migration time may need to be reinterpreted to incorporate change in migration cohort size .

aV[ 1 ] There remains uncertainty in the projected climate change over the 21st century , in part because of the range of response to rising greenhouse gas concentration in current global climate model ( GCMs ) . The representation of potential change in the form of a probability density function ( PDF ) is increasingly sought for application . This article present a method of estimating PDFs for projection based on the `` pattern scaling '' technique , which separate the uncertainty in the global mean warming from that in the standardized regional change . A mathematical framework for the problem is developed , which includes a joint probability distribution for the product of these two factor . Several simple approach are considered for representing the factor by PDFs using GCM result , allowing model weighting . The four-parameter beta distribution is found to provide a smooth PDF that can match the mean and range of GCM result , allowing skewness when appropriate . A beta representation of the range in global warming consistent with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report is presented . The method is applied to change in Australian temperature and precipitation , under the A1B scenario of concentration , using result from 23 GCMs in the CMIP3 database . Statistical result , including percentile and threshold exceedences , are compared for the case of southern Australian temperature change in summer . For the precipitation example , central Australian winter rainfall , the usual linear scaling assumption produce a net change PDF that extends to unphysically large decrease . This is avoided by assuming an exponential relationship between percentage decrease in rainfall and warming .

aVThe Gold Coast sandy beach of Queensland ( Australia ) are exposed to energetic wave condition . Storms , particularly tropical cyclone , have a high potential of destruction . The Gold Coast ha not experienced excessive erosive event over the past 30 year . However , some climate indicator suggest that cyclone frequency is likely to increase in response to global climate change within the near future . Over a 2-month period in early 2006 , beach survey were undertaken with a theodolite total station at four different site . Offshore wave condition were provided by SWAN regional wave modelling . During this study , the Gold Coast wa exposed to three major storm , the first one being the second most energetic over the past 30 year . Results show a substantial variability of the beach response to these event along the Gold Coast , and that engineering structure do not have marked effect . Easterly swell have the greatest impact on the Gold Coast sub-aerial beach morphology . When low wave-energy condition prevail , the southern Gold Coast beach recover more quickly than the northern one , a they are sheltered from high SE wave and draw advantage from the artificial sand bypassing system . Nevertheless , the data show that the Gold Coast beach are exceedingly fragile . For instance , the early March decadal event considerably weakened the beach , which resulted in surprisingly high erosion rate all along the Gold Coast during the two following annual wave event . This study suggests that the Gold Coast beach would not be able to withstand the impact of an increased frequency of extreme event similar in scale to those of 1967 .

aVThe capelin is a small pelagic fish that performs long distance migration . It is a key specie in the Barents Sea ecosystem and it distribution is highly climate dependent . Here we use an individual based model to investigate consequence of global warming on capelin distribution and population dynamic . The model relies on input on physic and plankton from a biophysical ocean model , and the entire life cycle of capelin including spawning of egg , larval drift and adult movement is simulated . Spawning day and adult movement strategy are adapted by a genetic algorithm . Spawning ha to take place in designated near-shore spawning area . The output generated by the model is capelin migration/distribution and population dynamic . We present simulation with present day climate and a future climate scenario . For the present climate the model evolves a spatial distribution resembling typical spatial dynamic of capelin with the coast of Northern Norway and Murman a the main spawning area . For the climate change simulation , the capelin is predicted to shift spawning eastward and also utilize new spawning area along Novaya Zemlya . There is also a shift in the adult distribution towards the north eastern part of the Barents Sea and earlier spawning associated with the warming .

aVHuman and industrial development over the past hundred year ha led to a huge increase in fossil fuel consumption and CO ( 2 ) emission , causing a dramatic increase in atmospheric CO ( 2 ) concentration . This increased CO ( 2 ) is believed to be responsible for a significant rise in global temperature over the past several decade . Global-scale climate modeling suggests that the temperature increase will continue , at least over the next few hundred year , leading to glacial melting and rising sea level . Increased atmospheric CO ( 2 ) also lead to ocean acidification , which will have drastic consequence for marine ecosystem . In an attempt to solve these problem , many have proposed the large-scale sequestration of CO ( 2 ) from our atmosphere . This introductory article present a summary of some of the evidence linking increasing atmospheric CO ( 2 ) concentration to global warming and ocean acidification and our effort to stem this rise though CO ( 2 ) sequestration .

aVIn the context of climate change and global warming , carbon sequestration receives a considerable attention now . In the latest assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , global mean temperature ha dramatically increased over the past decade . There is also mounting evidence that this increase will remain a problem on landuse change and industrial emission continue to worsen . Among the GHGs , CO ( 2 ) is the most abundant . Forest ecosystem such a mangrove play a significant role in the climate change problem because they serve a sink of atmospheric . Great attention is focused on tropical forest to offset carbon emission . Thus , this study wa intended to ass the carbon storage potential of a mangrove forest in San Juan Batangas . A nested plot method developed by ICRAF-ASB Program and allometric equation developed by Komiyama et . al . ( 2005 ) were employed to estimate the above-ground biomass and carbon density of the two stand : Rhizophora-dominated stand in Barangay Poctol ; and Avicennia-dominated stand in Barangay Catmon . Both Rhizophora and Avicennia dominated stand exhibited good carbon storage potential hence proper forest management is essential to sustain and improve it capacity to help mitigate climate change .

aVTwo type of carbonisation plant and one gasification plant have been developed and tested for effective utilisation of the product . The importance of by-product is increasing , a global warming is now a significant problem , and biomass resource can be used to alleviate the energy shortage and minimise the emission of greenhouse gas . Carbonisation of bagasse can add new value for production of energy and other material , so continuous type carbonisers were developed . The bagasse becomes charcoal by heating in the absence of oxygen for about 30 minute at 400 to 900 degree C. Bagasse charcoal wa used a a soil improvement material , absorbent , deodorant and so on . A large volume of burnable gas wa obtained from bagasse or it charcoal by the developed gasifier . The plant turn to a carboniser by exclusion of air . Therefore , bagasse can be used a a value-added resource for energy and other material by carbonisation and gasification .

aVThis study attempt to model alpine tundra vegetation dynamic in a tundra region in the Qinghai Province of China in response to global warming . We used Raster-based cellular automaton and a Geographic Information System to study the spatial and temporal vegetation dynamic . The cellular automaton model is implemented with IDRISI 's Multi-Criteria Evaluation functionality to simulate the spatial pattern of vegetation change assuming certain scenario of global mean temperature increase over time . The Vegetation Dynamic Simulation Model calculates a probability surface for each vegetation type , and then combine all vegetation type into a composite map , determined by the maximum likelihood that each vegetation type should distribute to each raster unit . With scenario of global temperature increase of I to 3 degree C , the vegetation type such a Dry Kobresia Meadow and Dry Potentilla Shrub that are adapted to warm and dry condition tend to become more dominant in the study area .

aVThe systematics , paleoenvironmental implication , and diversity of Cenozoic trace fossil from the Fuegian Andes are studied . The relatively complete Paleocene-Miocene stratigraphic column includes ichnoassemblages of the Cruziana ( Leticia Formation , late Middle Eocene ) , Zoophycos and Nereites ( Early Eocene-Early Miocene turbidite system ) ichnofacies . The last two ichnoasemblages contain the only known deep marine Cenozoic trace fossil in Argentina . The late Middle Eocene Leticia Formation represents a transgressive-regressive cycle and bear the ichnogenera Curvolithus , Diplocraterion , Gyrochorte , Rosselia , Patagonichnus , Asterosoma , Palaeophycus , Paradictyodora , Planolites , Rhizocorallium , Schaubcylindrichinus , Taenidium , and Teichichnus . Ichnogenera of the Early Eocene-Early Miocene turbidite system include Scolicia , Chondrites , Gyrophyllites , Nereites , Phycodes , Phycosiphon , Phymatoderma , Stelloglyphus , Zoophycos , Ophiomorpha and graphoglyptids . Graphoglyptids are dominated by Paleodictyon , Helicolithus , Helminthorhaphe , Desmograpton and Megagrapton . They are recorded in thin-bedded turbidites and mudstones ( lobe deposit ) and assigned to the Paleodictyon ichnosubfacies ( Nereites ichnofacies ) . Ophiomorpha rudis and O.. annulata are common at the contact between thick-bedded turbidites and mudstones , with abundant plant fragment . In sandrich , proximal channel-lobe deposit , they characterize the Ophiomorpha rudis ichnosubfacies ( Nereites ichnofacies ) . Scolicia prisca and Nereites isp . are common in rippled fine-grained sandstone interbedded with thin mudstones . Zoophycos ispp . are dominant in slope mudstones with synsedimentary slumping . The maximum ichnodiversity is recorded in the late Middle-Late Eocene ; which is concomitant with a marked cooling trend . The basal Oligocene display an abrupt drop in diversity , whereas the Early Miocene show a moderate diversity . These data do not support the alleged control of increased Eocene ichnodiversity by global warming during the Cenozoic thermal maximum . Specialized food competition , particularly for the graphoglyptid organism , and generalized oligotrophy seem to offer a better explanation .

aVIn order to investigate the change in the western North Pacific summer monsoon ( WNPSM ) caused by an increase in the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide ( CO ( 2 ) ) , nine coupled general circulation model ( CGCMs ) designed for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) Fourth Assessment Report ( AR4 ) are chosen , and their simulation are analyzed for the 20th century ( 20C3M ) and CO ( 2 ) -quadrupling scenario ( 1pctto4x ) experiment . The summer ( JJA ) mean climatology for several variable is analyzed in order to investigate the mean field change in the WNPSM circulation and the cause of this change . By performing the JJA mean analysis , we found that the rainfall over the WNPSM region , especially summer rainfall , increase with the CO ( 2 ) concentration , which result from the enhanced conditional instability caused by the warm sea-surface temperature ( SST ) and increased moisture , despite a slight weakening of the low-level convergence . On the other hand , to examine the change in the interannual variability of the WNPSM , we performed a composite analysis of the difference between the strong and the weak monsoon year with respect to a newly defined WNPSM index . In the precipitation analysis , it wa clarified that the monsoon variability would increase with global warming over the WNPSM region . The SST analysis revealed that the lag relationship between El Nino-Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) and WNPSM would be weakened with an increase in the CO ( 2 ) concentration , implying that prediction of the WNPSM would become slightly difficult . On the basis of global warming scenario result obtained from the IPCC AR4 model , it is concluded that both the intensity and variability of the WNPSM would increase with CO ( 2 ) concentration .

aVExtreme summer temperature have a significant impact on Australasia , and these are expected to intensify with global warming . The simulation of these extreme , particularly near coast , is limited by the modest resolution of global climate model such a the CSIRO Mk3.0 . We examine the temperature simulated by the regional model CCAM , at a resolution of around 0.5 degree , downscaled from Mk3.0 simulation . Extremes for three period , from monthly to decadal , are presented . The distribution of daily temperature in summer is characterised by a large variation of standard deviation ( SD ) across the region , peaking along the southern Australian coast . The distribution is positively skewed along most coast , and negatively skewed in the interior . There are strong correlation with daily wind . The projected mean warming over the 21st century for the A1B greenhouse gas scenario reach 3 degree C in the Australian interior , but barely half that on the south coast , a anticipated from the smaller rate of warming of the surrounding sea . There is rather little moderation of warming on the cast and west coast , however . Warming over New Zealand and New Guinea is typically 2 degree C , for both mean and extreme , some 50 per cent larger than that of the ocean . The SD of temperature anomaly increase over much of Australia , while skewness increase on some coast . Both SD and skewness decrease in the southeast . Changes in the extreme , relative to the mean , relate to those in both measure . This is demonstrated using a beta distribution fit to local daily temperature distribution . At many location , change in extreme can not be accurately estimated from a simple shift of the distribution . Much of the pattern of change is related to the effect of wind variability over the enhanced land-sea contrast , a shown using a simple model for the influence of wind .

aVWe analyze regional climate model ( RCM ) simulation of daily , spatially distributed extreme precipitation event , using co-operative network observation and output from 10-year RCM simulation of present and future-scanario climate . We examine an Upper Mississippi River basin region during October-march for daily amount that exceed the 99.95th percentile and that occure simultaneously at several observation site or model grid point . For the observation and each simulation , nearly all such extreme regional event occur when a slow moving , cut-off-low system develops over the Rockies and Great Plains and steadily pump moisture into the Upper mississippi region form the Gulf of Mexico . The threasold for the extreme event increase int eh future scenario by an amount similar to the increase in saturation specific humidity . The result suggest robust circulation behavior for such extreme in the face of climate change . Citation : Gutowski , W.J. , Jr. , S. S. Willis , J.C. Patton , B.R.J .

aVThis work aim at understanding future spatial and temporal distribution of tree specie in the Mediterranean region of France under various climate . We focused on two different specie ( Pinus Halepensis and Quercus Ilex ) and compared their growth under the IPCC-B2 climate scenario in order to quantify significant change between present and future . The influence of environmental factor such a atmospheric CO ( 2 ) increase and topography on the tree growth ha also been quantified . We modeled specie growth with the help of a process-based model ( MAIDEN ) , previously calibrated over measured ecophysiological and dendrochronological series with a Bayesian scheme . The model wa fed with the ARPEGE - MeteoFrance climate model , combined with an explicit increase in CO ( 2 ) atmospheric concentration . The main output of the model give the carbon allocation in bole and thus tree production . Our result show that the MAIDEN model is correctly able to simulate pine and oak production in space and time , after detailed calibration and validation stage . Yet , these simulation , mainly based on climate , are indicative and not predictive . The comparison of simulated growth at end of 20th and 21st century , show a shift of the pine production optimum from about 650 to 950m due to 2.5K temperature increase , while no optimum ha been found for oak . With the direct effect of CO ( 2 ) increase taken into account , both specie show a significant increase in productivity ( + 26 and + 43 % for pine and oak respectively ) at the end of the 21st century . While both specie have different growth mechanism , they have a good chance to extend their spatial distribution and their elevation in the Alps during the 21st century under the IPCC-B2 climate scenario . This extension is mainly due to the CO ( 2 ) fertilization effect .

aVSea level is a key variable in the context of global climate change . Climate-induced variability is expected to affect not only the mean sea level but also the amplitude and phase of it seasonal cycle . This study address the change in the amplitude and phase of the annual cycle of coastal sea level in the extra-tropical North Atlantic . The physical cause of these variation are explored by analysing the association between fluctuation in the annual amplitude of sea level and in ancillary parameter [ atmospheric pressure , sea-surface temperature and North Atlantic Oscillation ( NAO ) winter index ] . The annual cycle is extracted through autoregressive decomposition , in order to be able to separate variation in seasonality from long-term interannual variation in the mean . The change detected in the annual sea level cycle are regionally coherent , and related to change in the analysed forcing parameter . At the northern site , fluctuation in the annual amplitude of sea level are associated with concurrent change in temperature , while atmospheric pressure is the dominant influence for most of the site on the western boundary . The state of the NAO influence the annual variability in the Southern Bight , possibly through NAO-related change in wind stress and ocean circulation .

aVThe Earth and the ocean have warmed significantly over the past four decade , providing evidence that the Earth is undergoing long-term climate change . Increasing temperature and changing rainfall pattern have been documented . Cyanobacteria have a long evolutionary history , with their first occurrence dating back at least 2.7 billion year ago . Cyanobacteria often dominated the ocean after past mass extinction event . They evolved under anoxic condition and are well adapted to environmental stress including exposure to UV , high solar radiation and temperature , scarce and abundant nutrient . These environmental condition favor the dominance of cyanobacteria in many aquatic habitat , from freshwater to marine ecosystem . A few study have examined the ecological consequence of global warming on cyanobacteria and other phytoplankton over the past decade in freshwater , estuarine , and marine environment , with varying result . The response of cyanobacteria to changing environmental pattern associated with global climate change are important subject for future research . Results of this research will have ecological and biogeochemical significance a well a management implication .

aVThe boreal forest of North America are undergoing major change because of the direct effect of global warming and increased CO2 level . Plant production in the boreal forest is nutrient limited , and we examined how long-term fertilization affected growth of white spruce Picea glauca in the face of these major change . We conducted a large-scale experiment by fertilizing two 1 km ( 2 ) stand of white spruce in the southwestern Yukon with commercial NPK fertilizer from 1987 to 1994 , Tree growth wa measured by the width of annual increment in 60 tree from each of 2 control and of 2 matched fertilized 1 km ( 2 ) site for the period from 1977 to 1997 in a before , during , and after experimental design . Ring width increased in both control and fertilized tree over this period a summer temperature increased . Ring width in fertilized tree increased from 9 to 48 % over control tree during the year in which fertilizer wa added , but immediately fell back to control level from 1995 to 1997 at 1 site a soon a fertilization wa stopped . In the long term , nitrogen in these forest may become tied up in shrub , grass , herb , and fungi and not be available to the tree . There are 2 other possible explanation for this lack of sustained tree growth : first , the conversion of nitrogen into a form not readily available to spruce and , second , a spruce bark beetle outbreak that hit the southwestern Yukon during and after 1994 and affected 1 study site much more than the other .

aVThere wa a decline in southwest monsoon and annual rainfall since 1951 onwards at the rate of 5.2mm/year and 5.6 mm/year , respectively . The climate over Kerala also shifted from wetness to dryness within the humid climate ( 13 , to B . ) during the study period from 1951 to 2007 . There wa a shift in cropping system across the State of Kerala a the index of foodgrain crop wa declining while increasing the index of non-foodgrain crop . Unlike in seasonal crop , the effect of climate change on long term basis in term of global warming may not be seen on crop like coconut , rubber and arecanut a they are grown under tolerable limit of surface air temperature . However , the occurrence of flood and drought a evident in 2007 ( flood due to excess monsoon rainfall by 41 % against normal ) and summer 2004 ( drought due to no significant rainfall from November , 2003 to April 2004 ) , is likely to increase in ensuing decade a projected and crop loss are expected . The unusual summer rain in 2008 devastated the paddy crop in Kuttanad and Kole land of Thrissur . In contrast , it wa beneficial to crop like cardamom , coconut and arecanut . The thermosensitive crop like cocoa , black pepper , coffee , cardamom and tea may need attention a temperature range is likely to increase and rainfall is likely to decline in addition to deforestation a these crop are grown under the influence of typical forest -agro-ecosystems . Deforestation , shift in cropping system , decline in wetland and depletion of surface and groundwater resource may aggravate the ill effect of flood and drought on all the crop . Hence , there is an urgent need for pro-active measure on short-term and long-term basis against the climate change risk for sustenance of crop production both in term of quantity and quality .

aVGlobal warming is generally expected to increase the magnitude and frequency of extreme precipitation event , which may lead to more intense and frequent river flooding . This work ass the implication of climate change for future flood hazard in Europe . Regional climate simulation from the HIRHAM model with 12-km horizontal resolution were used to drive the hydrological model LISFLOOD , and extreme value technique were applied to the result to estimate the probability of extreme discharge . It wa found that by the end of this century under the Special Report on Emission Scenarios ( SRES ) A2 emission scenario in many European river extreme discharge level may increase in magnitude and frequency . In several river , most notably in the west and part of eastern Europe , the return period of what is currently a 100-year flood may in the future decrease to 50 year or le . A considerable decrease in flood hazard wa found in the northeast , where warmer winter and a shorter snow season reduce the magnitude of the spring snowmelt peak . Also in other river in central and southern Europe a decrease in extreme river flow wa simulated . The result were compared with those obtained with two HIRHAM experiment at 50-km resolution for the SRES A2 and B2 scenario . Disagreements between the various model experiment indicate that the effect of the horizontal resolution of the regional climate model is comparable in magnitude to the greenhouse gas scenario . Also , the choice of extreme value distribution to estimate discharge extreme influence the result , especially for event with higher return period .

aVIn highly seasonal environment , offspring production by vertebrate is timed to coincide with the annual peak of resource availability . For herbivore , this resource peak is represented by the annual onset and progression of the plant growth season . As plant phenology advance in response to climatic warming , there is potential for development of a mismatch between the peak of resource demand by reproducing herbivore and the peak of resource availability . For migratory herbivore , such a caribou , development of a trophic mismatch is particularly likely because the timing of their seasonal migration to summer range , where calf are born , is cued by change in day length , while onset of the plant-growing season on the same range is cued by local temperature . Using data collected since 1993 on timing of calving by caribou and timing of plant growth in West Greenland , we document the consequence for reproductive success of a developing trophic mismatch between caribou and their forage plant . As mean spring temperature at our study site have risen by more than 4 degree C , caribou have not kept pace with advancement of the plant-growing season on their calving range . As a consequence , offspring mortality ha risen and offspring production ha dropped fourfold .

aVWe examine the air quality ( AQ ) and radiative forcing ( RF ) response to emission reduction by economic sector for North America and developing Asia in the CAM and GISS composition/climate model . Decreases in annual average surface particulate are relatively robust , with intermodel variation in magnitude typically < 30 % and very similar spatial structure . Surface ozone response are small and highly model dependent . The largest net RF result from reduction in emission from the North America industrial/power and developing Asia domestic fuel burning sector . Sulfate reduction dominate the first case , for which intermodel variation in the sulfate ( or total ) aerosol optical depth ( AOD ) response are similar to 30 % and the modeled spatial pattern of the AOD reduction are highly correlated ( R=0.9 ) . Decreases in BC dominate the developing Asia domestic fuel burning case , and show substantially greater model-to-model difference . Intermodel variation in tropospheric ozone burden change are also large , though aerosol change dominate those case with substantial net climate forcing . The result indicate that across-the-board emission reduction in domestic fuel burning in developing Asia and in surface transportation in North America are likely to offer the greatest potential for substantial , simultaneous improvement in local air quality and near-term mitigation of global climate change via short-lived specie . Conversely , reduction in industrial/power emission have the potential to accelerate near-term warming , though they would improve AQ and have a long-term cooling effect on climate . These broad conclusion appear robust to intermodel difference .

aVThe variability of the insect-borne disease dengue in Puerto Rico wa studied in relation to climatic variable in the period 1979-2005 . Annual and monthly reported dengue case were compared with precipitation and temperature data . Results show that the incidence of dengue in Puerto Rico wa relatively constant over time despite global warming , possibly due to the offsetting effect of declining rainfall , improving health care and little change in population . Seasonal fluctuation of dengue were driven by rainfall increase from May to November . Year-to-year variability in dengue case wa positively related to temperature , but only weakly associated with local rainfall and an index of El Nino Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) . Climatic condition were mapped with respect to dengue case and pattern in high and low year were compared . During epidemic , a low pressure system east of Florida draw warm humid air over the northwestern Caribbean . Long-term trend in past observed and future projected rainfall and temperature were studied . Rainfall ha declined slowly , but temperature in the Caribbean are rising with the influence of global warming . Thus , dengue may increase in the future , and it will be necessary to anticipate dengue epidemic using climate forecast , to reduce adverse health impact .

aVThe climate of the Arctic marine environment is characterized by strong seasonality in the incoming solar radiation and by tremendous spatial variation arising from a variety of surface type , including open ocean , sea ice , large island , and proximity to major landmass . Interannual and decadal-scale variation are prominent feature of Arctic climate , complicating the distinction between natural and anthropogenically driven variation . Nevertheless , climate model consistently indicate that the Arctic is the most climatically sensitive region of the Northern Hemisphere , especially near the sea ice margin . The Arctic marine environment ha shown change over the past several decade , and these change are part of a broader global warming that exceeds the range of natural variability over the past 1000 year . Record minimum of sea ice coverage during the past few summer and increased melt from Greenland have important implication for the hydrographic regime of the Arctic marine environment . The recent change in the atmosphere ( temperature , precipitation , pressure ) , sea ice , and ocean appear to be a coordinated response to systematic variation of the large-scale atmospheric circulation , superimposed on a general warming that is likely associated with increasing greenhouse gas . The change have been sufficiently large in some sector ( e.g. , the Bering/Chukchi Seas ) that consequence for marine ecosystem appear to be underway . Global climate model indicate an additional warming of several degree Celsius in much of the Arctic marine environment by 2050 . However , the warming is seasonal ( largest in autumn and winter ) , spatially variable , and closely associated with further retreat of sea ice . Additional change predicted for 2050 are a general decrease of sea level pressure ( largest in the Bering sector ) and an increase of precipitation . While prediction of change in storminess can not be made with confidence , the predicted reduction of sea ice cover will almost certainly lead to increased oceanic mixing , ocean wave generation , and coastal flooding .

aVForced and natural variability of modelled and observed Atlantic Ocean temperature and Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation ( AMOC ) is studied . In the observation and in a forced climate model run , we find increasing temperature at 1000 in in the Atlantic ( 20N ) . SVD analysis show that ; , for both model data and observation , a high index of North Atlantic Oscillation ( NAO ) corresponds to negative temperature anomaly at 1000 m to the north of 55N , although geographical detail of temperature anomaly distribution are different for the model and observation . Particular attention ha been paid to the influence of the fresh water flux due to the present global warning on the slowing down of the AMOC . It is shown that fresh water flux change is only a secondary cause of reduced AMOC in global warming condition , while heat flux change is probably the main reason . Finally , it is shown that internal model AMOC variability is positively correlated with the near-surface air temperature in Atlantic-European Arctic sector on a 10-year time scale .

aVGlobal warming impels specie to track their shifting habitat or adapt to new condition . Both process are critically influenced by individual dispersal . In many animal , dispersal behaviour is plastic , but how organism with plastic dispersal respond to climate change is basically unknown . Here , we report the analysis of interannual dispersal change from 16 year of monitoring a wild population of the common lizard , and a 12-year manipulation of lizard ' diet intended to disentangle the direct effect of temperature rise on dispersal from it effect on resource availability . We show that juvenile dispersal ha declined dramatically over the last 16 year , paralleling the rise of spring temperature during embryogenesis . A mesoscale model of metapopulation dynamic predicts that in general dispersal inhibition will elevate the extinction risk of metapopulations exposed to contrasting effect of climate warming .

aVGlobal climate change ha been shown to cause variable shift in phenology in a variety of animal and unexpected outcome across food chain are to be found . Here we examined how rising annual spring temperature affected the interaction between seed masting , cavity nesting bird and dormouse using long-term data from Eastern Czech Republic . We have shown that climate change wa associated with unequal shift in the phenology of two cavity-breeding group : dormouse and bird . Rising spring temperature have progressively advanced the termination of hibernation for the edible dormouse Glis glis , a common bird predator , leading to an increasing overlap in the use of nesting box between dormouse and bird . In contrast , only the collared flycatcher Ficedula albicollis , of the four cavity-nesting bird specie , advanced it breeding date in response to rising temperature . At the same time , favourable weather condition , coupled with good seed masting year , have been associated with a substantial rise in dormouse number . Concurrent with the increasing dormouse abundance , the number of bird nest destroyed significantly increased in three out of four bird specie . We showed that while there wa a significant change in the date that the dormouse emerged from hibernation during the course of the study , it did not significantly contribute to predation level when controlling for their abundance and timing of breeding in bird . We found that the increasing dormouse abundance wa the main factor causing high brood loss in bird , while the timing of breeding in bird had a variable effect between bird specie . This study illustrates how change in climate might affect organism at various trophic level with often unexpected outcome . Limited evidence from other study organism suggests that specie most at risk are those at different trophic level that do not shift at the same rate or in the same direction a their food resource , predator or competitor .

aVThe Earth system model CLIMBER-2 is extended by a scheme for calculating the climatic response to anthropogenic sulphur dioxide emission . The scheme calculates the direct radiative forcing , the first indirect cloud albedo effect , and the second indirect cloud lifetime effect induced by geographically resolved sulphate aerosol burden . The simulated anthropogenic sulphate aerosol burden in the year 2000 amount to 0.47 TgS . The best guess for the radiative forcing due to the direct effect are -0.4 W m ( -2 ) and for the decrease in short-wave radiation due to all aerosol effect -0.8 W m ( -2 ) . The simulated global warming by 1 K from 1850 to 2000 caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gas reduces to 0.6 K when the sulphate aerosol effect are included . The model 's hydrological sensitivity of 4 % /K is decreased by the second indirect effect to 0.8 % /K . The quality of the geographically distributed climatic response to the historic emission of sulphur dioxide and greenhouse gas make the extended model relevant to computational efficient investigation of future climate change scenario .

aVCompared to other ecosystem , estuarine ecosystem have distinct carbon flux dynamic - the lateral carbon flux incurred by tidal activity , and methane generation under the anaerobic condition of wetland soil . The conventional estimation of gross primary production ( GPP ) based on the light use efficiency ( LUE ) model used for non-wetland terrestrial ecosystem , therefore , can not be applied directly to estuarine wetland ecosystem . In this paper , we estimated the 2005 's annual carbon budget of an estuarine wetland on Chongming Island , Shanghai , and partitioned the loss of carbon due to lateral tidal dynamic and anaerobic methane production using an innovative technique . The average GPP calculated from eddy covariance between March and November wa 261.79 mu mol m ( -2 ) day ( -1 ) , whereas that from the LUE model wa 58.84 mu mol m ( -2 ) day ( -1 ) . The correlation coefficient between GPP simulated from the LUE model and that calculated from flux tower data wa low in the growing season ( R ( 2 ) =0.55 ) . We hypothesized that tidal activity and uncounted methane release were responsible for the difference , which can be predicted from measurement of remote sensing product such a land surface water index ( LSWI ) , evapotranspiration ( ET ) , and tide height ( TH ) . We developed an integrated GPP model by combining the LUE model and an autoregression model to estimate carbon budget . The average GPP from the modified model increased to 263.38 mu mol m ( -2 ) day ( -1 ) , and R ( 2 ) for the correlation between the simulated and calculated data increased to 0.88 , demonstrating the potential of our technique for GPP estimation and quantification of seasonal variation in estuarine ecosystem . The approach developed in this study ha great potential for correcting unavoidable error when estimating carbon budget of coastal wetland . Furthermore , global warming is expected to accelerate sea level rise , which may enhance the effect of tidal activity and increase the difficulty in estimating coastal carbon budget using conventional method .

aVThe high altitude spruce-fir ( Abies fraseri ( Pursh ) Poiret.-Picea rubens Sarg . ) forest of the southern Appalachian Mountains , USA , experience frequent cloud immersion . Recent study indicate that cloud base may have risen over the past 30 year , resulting in le frequent forest cloud immersion , and that further increase in cloud base height are likely in the event of continued climate warming . To ass the impact of this trend on the regeneration of high altitude spruce-fir forest and the migration of plant community , in particular the encroachment of spruce-fir forest and Rhododendron catawbiense Michx . island into adjacent grass bald community , we investigated effect of cloud immersion on photosynthetic parameter of seedling of Abies fraseri and R. catawbiense in a grass bald site and A. fraseri in a forest understory . Although photosynthetic photon flux wa 4.2 to 19.4-fold greater during clear condition , cloud immersion had no effect on photosynthesis in A. fraseri at either site , whereas it reduced photosynthesis of R. catawbiense by about 40 % . However , cloud immersion increased mean leaf fluorescence by 7.1 to 12.8 % in both specie at both site . Cloud immersion increased mean relative humidity from 65 to 96 % , reduced transpiration by 95 % and reduced mean leaf-to-air temperature difference from 6.6 to 0.5 degree C .

aVWetlands have important filter function in landscape but are considered to be the biggest unknown regarding their element dynamic under global climate change . Information on sink and source function of sulphur , nitrogen , organic matter and acidity in wetland is crucial for freshwater regeneration . Recent result indicate that redox process are not completely controlled by the sequential reduction chain ( that is electron acceptor availability ) but that electron donor availability may be an important regulator . Our hypothesis wa that only site which are limited in their electron donor availability low concentration of dissolved organic carbon ( DOC ) ) follow the concept of the sequential reduction chain . We compared the result of two freshwater wetland system : 1 ) three forested fen within a boreal spruce catchment in a low mountain range in southern Germany ( high DOC regime ) and 2 ) three floodplain soil within a groundwater enrichment area in the Rhein valley in northwest Switzerland ( low DOC regime ) . Micro scale investigation ( a few cm ) with dialyse chamber a well a soil solution and groundwater concentration at the forested fen ( high DOC regime ) indicated simultaneous consumption of nitrate and sulphate with release of iron , manganese and methane ( CH4 ) a well a an enrichment in stable sulphur isotope indicating a co-existence of process attributed to different redox gradient . Soil and aquifer gas measurement down to 4.6 m at the groundwater enrichment site ( low DOC regime and carbon limitation ) showed extreme high rate of metabolism with carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , dinitrous oxide ( N2O ) and CH4 concentration reaching fifty , thirty and three time atmospheric concentration , respectively . Simultaneously , groundwater oxygen ( O-2 ) saturation wa between 50 and 95 % . We concluded that independent of DOC regime the sequential reduction chain wa not a suitable concept in our system . Instead of electron acceptor or donor availability micro site variability might explain the co-existence of redox process within our site . ( C ) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All right reserved .

aVSemarang is one of the biggest city in Indonesia and is nowadays suffering from coastal flooding . Land subsidence , high water tide , and inadequate structural measure play important role in the coastal inundation . Structural and non-structural method for controlling coastal flooding including dyke , drainage system , pump station , polder system , coastal-land reclamation , coastal planning and management , public education , a well a the establishment of an institutional framework for disaster management have been implemented in the Semarang coastal area . Although some improvement have been made , the current flood management system ha generally failed to address a wide range of coastal inundation problem . Some improvement action have been proposed including stakeholder involvement on the disaster mitigation . For a long period coastal management , accelerated sea level rise due to global warming should also be taken into account .

aVA number of environmentally adapted lubricant have been proposed in response to the environmental and health impact of metalworking fluid ( MWFs ) . The alternative typically substitute petroleum with vegetable-based component and/or deliver minimum quantity of lubricant in gas rather than water , with the former strategy being more prevalent than the latter . A comparative life cycle assessment of water- and gas-based system ha shown that delivery of lubricant in air rather than water can reduce solid waste by 60 % , water use by 90 % , and aquatic toxicity by 80 % , while virtually eliminating occupational health concern . However , air-delivery of lubricant can not be used for severe machining operation due to limitation of cooling and lubricant delivery . For such operation , lubricant delivered in supercritical carbon dioxide ( ScCO2 ) are effective while maintaining the health and environmental advantage of air-based system . Although delivery condition were found to significantly influence the environmental burden of all fluid , energy consumption wa relatively constant under expected operating condition . Global warming potential ( GWP ) increased when delivering lubricant in gas rather than water though all class of MWFs have low GWP compared with other factory operation . It is therefore concluded that the possibility of increased GWP when switching to gas-based MWFs is a reasonable tradeoff for definite and large reduction in aquatic toxicity , water use , solid waste , and occupational health risk .

aVAmplification of the hydrological cycle a a consequence of global warming is forecast to lead more extreme intra-annual precipitation regime . characterized by larger rainfall event and longer interval between event . We present a conceptual framework , based on past investigation and ecological theory , for predicting the consequence of this underappreciated aspect of climate change . We consider a brand range of terrestrial ecosystem that vary in their over-all mater balance . More extreme rainfall regime are expected to increase the duration and severity of soil water water stress in mesic ecosystem a interval between rainfall event increase . In contrast , xeric ecosystem may exhibit the opposite response to extreme event . Larger but le frequent rainfall event may result in proportional reduction in evaporative loss in xenic system , and thus may lead to greater soil water availability Hydric ( wetland ) ecosystem are predicted to experience reduced period of anoxia in response to prolonged interval between rainfall event . Understanding these contingent effect of ecosystem canter balance is necessary for predicting how nun e interval precipitation regime will modify ecosystem process and alter interaction with related global change driver .

aVIn the context of global warming , nuclear energy is a carbon-free source of power and so is a meaningful option for energy production without CO2 emission . Currently , there are more than 440 commercial nuclear reactor , accounting for about 15 % of electric power generation in the world , and there ha not been a major accident in over 20 year . The world 's fleet of nuclear power plant is , on average , more than 20 year old . Even though the design life of a nuclear power plant is typically 30 or 40 year , it is quite feasible that many nuclear power plant will be able to operate for longer than this .

aVSeveral scenario experiment of the IPCC 4th Assessment Report ( AR4 ) are performed by version g1.0 of a Flexible coupled Ocean-Atmosphere-Land System Model ( FGOALS ) developed at the Institute of Atmospheric Physics , Chinese Academy of Sciences ( IAP/CAS ) , including the `` Climate of the 20th century experiment '' , `` CO ( 2 ) 1 % increase per year to doubling experiment '' and two separate IPCC greenhouse gas emission scenario A1B and B1 experiment . To distinguish between the different impact of natural variation and human activity on the climate change , three-member ensemble run are performed for each scenario experiment . The coupled model simulation show : ( 1 ) from 1900 to 2000 , the global mean temperature increase about 0.5 degree C and the major increase occurs during the later half of the 20th century , which is in consistent with the observation that highlight the coupled model 's ability to reproduce the climate change since the industrial revolution ; ( 2 ) the global mean surface air temperature increase about 16 degree C in the CO ( 2 ) doubling experiment and 1.5 degree C and 2.4 degree C in the A1B and B1 scenario , respectively . The global warming is indicated by not only the change of the surface temperature and precipitation but also the temperature increase in the deep ocean . The thermal expansion of the sea water would induce the rise of the global mean sea level . Both the control run and the 20th century climate change run are carried out again with version g1.1 of FGOALS , in which the cold bias in the high latitude were removed . They are then compared with those from version g1.0 of FGOALS in order to distinguish the effect of the model bias on the simulation of global warming .

aVThe long-term rate of racemization for amino acid preserved in planktonic foraminifera wa determined by using independently dated sediment core from the Arctic Ocean . The racemization rate for aspartic acid ( Asp ) and glutamic acid ( Glu ) in the common taxon , Neogloboquadrina pachyderma , were calibrated for the last 150 ka using ( 14 ) C age and the emerging Quaternary chronostratigraphy of Arctic Ocean sediment . An analysis of error indicates realistic age uncertainty of about +/- 12 % for Asp and +/- 17 % for Glu . Fifty individual test are sufficient to analyze multiple subsamples , identify outlier , and derive robust sample mean value . The new age equation can be applied to verify and refine age model for sediment core elsewhere in the Arctic Ocean , a critical region for understanding the dynamic of global climate change .

aVThis study investigated the decomposition of hydrofluorocarbon ( HFCs ) having high global warming potential by using a dielectric-packed-bed nonthermal plasma reactor with barium titanate bead a the packing material . The target HFCs were 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane ( HFC-134a ) and 1,1-difluoroethene ( HFC-132a ) . The effect of several parameter such a reaction temperature , oxygen content , and initial concentration on the HFC decomposition efficiency were evaluated . There wa essentially no temperature dependence of the HFC decomposition efficiency in the range 150-250 degree C. The optimum oxygen content for HFC decomposition wa found to be about 0.5 vol % . Variations in the initial concentration did not affect the decomposition efficiency . The decomposition product were analyzed , and some decomposition pathway were elucidated . The energy requirement for the decomposition of HFC-134a and HFC-132a were found to be 0.038 and 0.062 mol MJ ( -1 ) , respectively , based on the initial concentration of 200 and 120 ppm ( part per million , volumetric ) .

aVThe very potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide ( N ( 2 ) O ) is widely used a a mild anaesthetic for mother in delivery work in Sweden . As a part of the Stockholm County Council environmental program it wa decided in 2002 that the emission should be drastically reduced . Different way were theoretically evaluated , and catalytic splitting to nitrogen and oxygen gas ( N ( 2 ) and O ( 2 ) ) wa chosen for a demonstration installation . A Japanese commercial unit for treatment of mixed anaesthetic gas ( Anesclean ( R ) from Showa Denko K.K . ) wa thoroughly modified and installed at the Karolinska University Hospital at Huddinge in Stockholm in 2004 . The destruction of N ( 2 ) O wa optimised and studied for 2 year . Data from both collection and destruction are given in the article . Of the collected N ( 2 ) O more than 95 % wa split to N ( 2 ) and O ( 2 ) in the very stable system . The overall emission decrease wa mainly dependent on the share that could be collected in the specific exhaustion system a compared to the normal room ventilation . Life cycle assessment ( LCA ) and life cycle costing ( LCC ) were used to evaluate the actual environmental value and economical cost for the process . Important factor are pointed out .

aVLow phosphorus availability ( low P ) often delay flowering and maturity in annual plant , while abiotic stress generally accelerates flowering and maturity . The utility of this response is unknown . We hypothesize that phenological delay in low P is beneficial by permitting more time for phosphorus acquisition and utilization . We grew seven genotype of Arabidopsis thaliana with contrasting phenology in high and low P. Low P delayed bolting and maturity in all genotype . Low P decreased root length , but not root-length duration ( the integral of root length over time ) , because phenological delay allowed low-P plant to compensate for shorter root length . Root-length duration wa correlated with phosphorus accumulation . Leaf phosphorus duration ( the integral of leaf phosphorus over time ) wa correlated with reproductive biomass , indicating the utility of increased phosphorus utilization . Phenological delay accounted for up to 30 % of biomass production when low-P plant were compared to model of plant with no delay . These result support the hypothesis that phenological delay in low P is adaptive and lead to increased phosphorus acquisition and utilization . Because low P condition are prevalent , understanding the utility of this response could be useful in crop breeding and in predicting plant response to global climate change .

aVThis study demonstrated the feasibility of ammonia combustion in compression-ignition diesel engine . Ammonia combustion doe not produce carbon dioxide , a known greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming . Using this idea , a method wa developed to introduce ammonia into the intake manifold and to inject diesel fuel or biodiesel directly into the cylinder to ignite the mixture . This dual-fuel approach wa chosen because ammonia ha a high resistance to autoignition . This approach wa proven successful in a multicylinder , turbocharged diesel engine . The system developed required only a slight modification of the intake to implement the ammonia fuel line . The existing diesel fuel injection system remained unchanged . A liquid ammonia tank wa used for fuel storage , and a high pressure relief valve regulated the ammonia flow rate . Engine combustion phasing ( e.g. , ignition ) wa controlled by diesel fuel injection . Both experiment and chemical kinetic study were carried out for different diesel/ammonia ratio at various engine speed and load . Ammonia wa used a an energy replacement for diesel fuel . The result showed that the peak engine torque could be achieved by using different combination of diesel fuel and ammonia . During testing , a maximum energy replacement of 95 % wa measured . It should be noted that if more ammonia is added , a higher than rated power can be achieved depending on engine load condition . This would be similar in practice to adding nitrous oxide to gasoline engine . It wa also shown that CO2 emission were reduced monotonically for the same engine torque output a the amount of the ammonia in the fuel mixture increased . Additionally , burning ammonia in engine doe not necessarily increase NOx emission despite the fuel-bound nitrogen . Lower level of NOx emission were obtained a long a energy substitution by ammonia did not exceed 60 % . This is thought to occur because of the lower combustion temperature of ammonia . This study also showed that the engine could be operated at different load condition by using a small quantity of diesel fuel with the appropriate amount of ammonia to achieve desirable load . Biodiesel wa also used with ammonia at different ratio resulting in successful engine operation . Results of using biodiesel-ammonia were similar to those of using diesel fuel-ammonia .

aVIn the light of the predicted global climate change , it is essential that the status and diversity of polar microbial community is described and understood . In the present study , molecular tool were used to investigate the marine eukaryotic community of Prydz Bay , Eastern Antarctica , from November 2002 to January 2003 . Additionally , we conducted four series of minicosm experiment , where natural Prydz Bay community were incubated under six different irradiation regime , in order to investigate the effect of natural UV radiation on marine microbial eukaryote . Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis ( DGGE ) and 18S rRNA gene sequencing revealed a eukaryotic Shannon diversity index averaging 2.26 and 2.12 , respectively . Phylogenetic analysis of 472 sequenced clone revealed 47 phylotypes , belonging to the Dinophyceae , Stramenopiles , Choanoflagellidae , Ciliophora , Cercozoa and Metazoa . Throughout the studied period , three community were distinguished : a postwinter/early spring community comprising dinoflagellate , ciliate , cercozoans , stramenopiles , viridiplantae , haptophytes and metazoan ; a dinoflagellate-dominated community ; and a diatom-dominated community that developed after sea ice breakup . DGGE analysis showed that size fraction and time had a strong shaping effect on the community composition ; however , a significant contribution of natural UV irradiance towards microeukaryotic community composition could not be detected . Overall , dinoflagellate dominated our sample and their diversity suggests that they fulfill an important role in Antarctic coastal marine ecosystem preceding ice breakup a well a between phytoplankton bloom event .

aVPurpose : Global warming raise the question whether climate change are detectable on the German North Sea coast that are relevant to human physiology and health . Methods : The analysis is based on publicly accessible meteorological data provided by the Deutsche Wetterdienst ( German National Meteorological Service ) . Daily maximum temperature were extracted from the time series of the measuring station List on the North Sea island of Sylt ( Germany ) for the period from 1937 to 2006 . For comparative purpose , data measured in Westerland ( Sylt ) from 1996 to 2006 and at some inland station were analysed a well . Results : Annual frequency of day when the daily maximum temperature reached or exceeded 25 degree C ( T-max > = 25 degree C ) were significantly higher in the second half of the time series than in the first half . The same hold true for the number of day when the maximum temperature reached or exceeded 30 degree C ( T-max > = 30 degree C ) . Four fifth of these hot day were observed in the second half of the period ( 1974 to 2006 ) . The 15 year moving average of the annual frequency of day with T-max > = 25 degree C exhibited a clear trend towards increasing frequency . The annual frequency of T-max > = 25 degree C-days and hot day T-max > = 30 degree C in List and in Westerland differed only slightly . Despite these increasing tendency , hot day are still very rare on the North Sea Island of Sylt when compared to the respective frequency observed at inland station . Conclusions : The analysis of the time series of the daily maximum temperature indicates that hot temperature are becoming more frequent even in maritime climate , while hot day are still very rare compared to inland location . The result fit the scenario of global warming . With respect to human physiology , the increasing frequency of extreme temperature is far more important than change in mean value , since hot environmental condition mean physical stress . Moreover , warm environment limit the ability to be physically active for instance within the context of exercise therapy .

aVBy altering myriad aspect of leaf chemistry , increasing concentration of CO2 and O-3 in the atmosphere derived from human activity may fundamentally alter the relationship between insect herbivore and plant . Because exposure to elevated CO2 can alter the nutritional value of leaf , some herbivore may increase consumption rate to compensate . The effect of O-3 on leaf nutritional quality are le clear ; however , increased senescence may also reduce leaf quality for insect herbivore . Additionally , change in secondary chemistry and the microclimate of leaf may render plant more susceptible to herbivory in elevated CO2 and O-3 . Damage to soybean ( Glycine max L. ) leaf and the size and composition of the insect community in the plant canopy were examined in large intact plot exposed to elevated CO2 ( similar to 550 mu mol mol ( -1 ) ) and elevated O-3 ( 1.2* ambient ) in a fully factorial design with a Soybean Free Air Concentration Enrichment system ( SoyFACE ) . Leaf area removed by folivorous insect wa estimated by digital photography and insect survey were conducted during two consecutive growing season , 2003 and 2004 . Elevated CO2 alone and in combination with O-3 increased the number of insect and the amount of leaf area removed by insect herbivore across feeding guild . Exposure to elevated CO2 significantly increased the number of western corn rootworm ( Diabrotica virgifera ) adult ( foliage chewer ) and soybean aphid ( Aphis glycine ; phloem feeder ) . No consistent effect of elevated O-3 on herbivory or insect population size wa detected . Increased loss of leaf area to herbivore wa associated with increased carbon-to-nitrogen ratio and leaf surface temperature . Soybean aphid are invasive pest in North America and new to this ecosystem . Higher concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere may increase herbivory in the soybean agroecosystem , particularly by recently introduced insect herbivore .

aVIn the framework of climate change , it ha been predicted that the Mediterranean Basin will experience the greatest loss of biodiversity , because it will be heavily affected by several driver of change . In particular , Italy is an important geographical area because it represents a key hotspot of biodiversity . The aim of this study wa to evaluate the effect of global climate chan-e on terrestrial small mammal ( Rodents and Soricomorphs ) in Italy . Barn owl ( 7:1 , to alba ) pellet analysis wa applied to study the temporal variation of microteriocoenoses structure . We revisited 21 roosting , site which had been previously studied by other author and we carried out a similar study in order to analyse possible change in small mammal community . Analyses covered a period of about 30 year and the gap between the first and second sampling range from I I to 33 year . Collecting locality were grouped according to the Bioclimatic Map of Italy . Several ecological index were applied and their change through time were analysed for each Bioclimatic Region . Results show a significant increase in thermoxerophilic specie in the last thirty year , particularly in the Mediterranean Region . This observed rise is likely due to global and local warming . In fact , higher temperature , lower precipitation and increasing xerothermic condition could have facilitated the spread of thermoxerophilic specie . The persistence of such a trend could lead to a series of serious ecological consequence in the future , including a possible reduction in biodiversity .

aVMany amphibian depend on wetland ecosystem for reproduction and survival , and coastal wetland are not the exception . Recent advance on climate change research predict a reduction in land cover of coastal wetland due to sea-level rise in response to global warming . Although this scenario will contribute to further amphibian population decline worldwide the impact of sea-level rise and it related salt water intrusion on anuran assemblage in coastal wetland remain largely unknown . I documented pattern of abundance of the native Caribbean white-lipped frog ( Leptodactylus albilabris ) and the introduced marine toad ( Bufo marinus ) along an inland-to-coastal salinity gradient in Puerto Rico . In addition , I investigated the effect of increasing salinity on larval growth and survival to metamorphosis in L. albilabris and B. marinus in laboratory experiment . In the field , relative abundance of adult of L. albilabris decreased with increasing salinity , while B. marinus the opposite pattern . Laboratory experiment with L. albilabris and B. marinus revealed that percentage of larva surviving to metamorphosis in both specie wa greatly reduced in 22-25 % seawater ( 8 ppt ) , which is within salinity level found in their natural distribution . In this salinity level , the native L. albilabris showed similar to 100 % metamorphosis failure while the introduced B. marinus showed similar to 60 % metamorphosis failure . The reduction in metamorphosis wa due to high mortality in L albilabris and wa accompanied with morphological abnormality in B. marinus . Tadpoles of only L. albilabris reared for four week showed significant weight loss at 8 ppt , but showed no difference in length . These result suggest that anuran tadpole may be living near their physiological limit for salinity in the studied wetland . Conservation implication are profound , however , a salt water intrusion and urban encroaching inland may result in anuran population replacement , from native specie to introduced specie in this wetland .

aVPurpose - The aim is to investigate in detail the sensitivity of sediment transport and bed morphology with respect to some parameter including bed slope , non-hydrostatic pressure term , sand grain size , temperature , salinity and lower boundary condition for suspended sand concentration on a regional scale through numerical simulation based on a mathematical model . Design/methodology/approach - The numerical model consists of a 3D hydrodynamic code amended by a sediment transport module . At the same time , the influence of wave action ha been taken into account . The model is applied to the Sylt-Romo tidal bay covering approximately 20 x 30 km ( 2 ) spanned by about 2.7 X 10 ( 6 ) active grid point with the constant wind and wave field . Findings - The computed result of seven different case over 150 h show that the effect of bed slope correction is very strong , especially in case of largely changeable bathymetry and depends on the horizontal grid resolution . Sand grain size strongly influence the vertical distribution of suspended sediment and then sedimentation . The impact of sea water temperature is relatively clear despite being le powerful than two former parameter . Non-hydrostatic pressure perturbation of the flow field and the kind of the lower boundary condition a well a salinity are negligible allowing for considerable saving of CPU time when the numerical simulation is carried out for a large area and for a very long-time period . Originality/value - The result of the study demonstrate that the geometrical factor of coastal bed and the range of sand particle size on the bottom contribute to the tendency of bed evolution in some measure . Additionally , the increase of temperature of sea water due to global warming may also make a considerable change to the mechanism of sediment transport and sedimentation in future . Therefore , the human intervention in the process of natural evolution is possible through the behaviour to the nature . At the same time , this is also interesting and useful information and it can consolidate the idea for coastal engineering project .

aV[ 1 ] Interannual-decadal variability in the equatorial Pacific El Nino-Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) induces climate change at global scale , but it potential influence during past global climate change is not yet well constrained . New high-resolution eastern equatorial Pacific proxy record of thermocline condition present new evidence of strong orbital control in ENSO-like variability over the last 275,000 year . Recurrent interval of saltier thermocline water are associated with the dominance of La Nina-like condition during glacial termination , coinciding with period of low precession and high obliquity . The parallel dominance of delta ( 13 ) C-depleted water support the advection of Antarctic origin water toward the tropical thermocline . This `` oceanic tunneling '' is proposed to have reinforced orbitally induced change in ENSO-like variability , composing a complex high- and low-latitude feedback during glacial termination .

The period of 1961-1990 wa considered a the basic run . We quantified the change of the close past on the basis of the decade between 1997 and 2006 . The other 6 scenario were elaborated on the one hand by downscaling the IPCC ( 2007 ) report ( A2 and B2 ) , on the other hand by taking into account a more serious weather change . At determining plant and soil characteristic of the individual scenario we applied the principle of analogy being extensively used in meteorological practice ; in this method we selected the value of that year from the observation data series of almost 30 year that were the closest to the year to be simulated . The ratio of latent heat decreased by 4.8 % only at doubling CO ( 2 ) concentration . The largest difference in the ratio of sensible and latent heat wa in the case of the run containing the highest warming up and largest precipitation decrease , where the ratio of latent heat increased by 8.8 % . One of the cause of global warming is the raised CO ( 2 ) concentration narrowed the stoma opening by 14.3 % in itself ; it is the quantified value of the positive impact of global warming on plant evaporation , referring to Keszthely . Warming up over 6 degree C raised the latent heat compared to the basic run in a statistically justifiable way in the case of each scenario ; according to this , in Keszthely , assuming an average July , even in the case of a temperature rise of 6 degree C there are some humidity reserve that can be used for transpiration by maize plant . Precipitation loss of 30 % associated with warming up of 9 degree C , however , reduced this reserve to a minimum . In our opinion , water seems to be the bottleneck of the future ; farmer have to prepare to face the lack of water , even in the case if nowadays the forecast of precipitation change is rather volatile .

aVObservations show that the tropical El Ni ( n ) over tildeo-Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) variability , after removing both the long term trend and decadal change of the background climate , ha been enhanced by a much a 60 % during the past 50 year . This shift in ENSO amplitude can be related to mean state change in global climate . Past global warming ha caused a weakening of the Walker circulation over the equatorial Indo-Pacific ocean , a well a a weakening of the trade wind and a reduction in the equatorial upwelling . These change in tropical climatology play a stabilizing factor of the tropical coupling system . However , the shallower and strengthening thermocline in the equatorial Pacific increase the SST sensitivity to thermocline and wind stress variability and tend to destabilize the tropical coupling system . Observations suggest that the destabilizing factor , such a the strengthening thermocline , may have overwhelmed the stabilizing effect of the atmosphere , and played a deterministic role in the enhanced ENSO variability , at least during the past half century . This is different from the recent assessment of IPCC-AR4 coupled model .

aVAn evaluation of the environmental impact of an air-conditioning system which us a bore-hole system for heating and cooling is the aim of this case study . To facilitate the evaluation , the bore-hole based air-conditioning system is compared with a reference system that us a more traditional source of heat ( district heating ) and cooling energy ( refrigeration ) . Environmental impact of the system are examined by the life cycle assessment ( LCA ) method , including the weighting step . Results show that the bore-hole based system performs better in three of the four impact category investigated : acidification , eutrofication , and global warming potential ( GWP ) with a 100-year horizon . This is mainly due to the fact that it us le material in the production phase and le operating energy during the user stage . However , in the category of photochemical ozone creation potential ( POCP ) , it performs four time worse than the more traditional system . Nevertheless , the overall environmental impact of the bore-hole based system , evaluated by common weighting method , is better than the more traditional system . The most dominant environmental impact of both system arises from the operating energy , although the energy use in the building studied is low . ( C ) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVInventorisation of input ( chemical and energy ) for treating textile wastewater using pretreatment , reverse osmosis ( RO ) and evaporator for two representative textile wastewater treatment plant have been studied . All life cycle inventory data were recalculated per functional unit , which wa defined a treatment of 1 m ( 3 ) of textile wastewater . Evaporator consumes 48 % of electricity , which contributes for more global warming potential ( GWP ) than other treatment unit . Total GWP for plant I and II are 4049 kg CO2 eq and 5.56 kg CO2 eq respectively . During electricity generation , CO2 emission is comparatively high ( 98.5 % of total emission ) . The result indicate that RO system of plant I and II consumes le energy and GWP are 8.9 x 10 ( -3 ) kg CO2 eq and 0.011 kg CO2 eq respectively . Human health impact is 7.4 E-05 for CO2 emission , which is le for other emission . The result can be used for strategic decision for minimizing environmental impact of zero liquid treatment technology .

aVWith growing concern about global warming and surging oil price , nuclear power is now back on the U.S. energy policy agenda . This paper provides firm level analysis of the production technology and cost structure in the U.S. nuclear power generation industry . The paper applies an econometric approach into a dual restricted variable cost function within a `` temporal equilibrium '' framework . A panel data set of 32 nuclear power generation for major U.S. investor owned utility over the period 1986-2002 is used . The major finding indicates that most electric utility in the nuclear electricity generation industry over utilized capital in production . The estimated result show evidence of scale economy in the production of the electricity industry . The paper present supporting evidence that nuclear technology is cheaper than other alternative technology and fuel , and it can offer possible cost saving to other alternative technology .

aVThe effect of elevated carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) on crop yield is one of the most uncertain and influential parameter in model used to ass climate change impact and adaptation . A primary reason for this uncertainty is the limited availability of experimental data on CO2 response for crop grown under typical field condition . However , because of historical variation in CO2 , each year farmer throughout the world perform uncontrolled yield 'experiments ' under different level of CO2 . In this study , measurement of atmospheric CO2 growth rate and crop yield for individual country since 1961 were compared with empirically determine the average effect of a 1 ppm increase of CO2 on yield of rice , wheat , and maize . Because the gradual increase in CO2 is highly correlated with major change in technology , management , and other yield controlling factor , we focused on first difference of CO2 and yield time series . Estimates of CO2 response obtained from this approach were highly uncertain , reflecting the relatively small importance of year-to-year CO2 change for yield variability . Combining estimate from the top 20 country for each crop resulted in estimate with substantially le uncertainty than from any individual country . The result indicate that while current datasets can not reliably constrain estimate beyond previous experimental study , an empirical approach supported by large amount of data may provide a potentially valuable and independent assessment of this critical model parameter . For example , analysis of reliable yield record from hundred of individual , independent location ( a opposed to national scale yield record with poorly defined error ) may result in empirical estimate with useful level of uncertainty to complement estimate from experimental study .

aVA large portion of carbon ( C ) is stored in the world 's soil , including those of peatlands , wetland and permafrost . However , there is disagreement regarding the effect of climate change on the rate of organic matter decomposition in permafrost soil of the arctic . In this study it wa hypothesized that soil exposed to a higher ambient temperature would have a greater flux Of CO2 a well a a change in the metabolic diversity of culturable soil microorganism . To evaluate this hypothesis we determined soil C dynamic , soil microbial respiration and activity , and C-13 and N-15 fractionation in laboratory incubation ( at 14 and 21 degree C ) for an organic-rich soil ( Mesic Organic Cryosol ) and a mineral soil ( Turbic Cryosol ) collected at the Daring Lake Research Station in Canada 's Northwest Territories . Soil organic C ( SOC ) and nitrogen ( N ) stock ( g m ( -2 ) ) and concentration ( % ) were significantly different ( P < 0.05 ) between soil horizon for both soil type . Stable isotope analysis showed a significant enrichment in delta C-13 and delta N-15 with depth and a depletion in delta C-13 and delta N-15 with increasing SOC and N concentration . In laboratory incubation , microbial respiration showed three distinct phase of decomposition : a phase with a rapidly increasing rate of respiration ( phase 1 ) , a phase in which respiration reached a peak midway through the incubation ( phase 2 ) , and a phase in the latter part of the incubation in which respiration stabilized at a lower flux than that of the first phase ( phase 3 ) . Fluxes Of CO2 were significantly greater at 21 degree C than at 14 degree C. The delta C-13 of the evolved CO2 became significantly enriched with time with the greatest enrichment occurring in phase 2 of the incubation . Soil microbial activity , a measured using Biolog Ecoplates ( TM ) , showed a significantly greater average well color development , richness , and Shannon index at 21 degree C ; again the greatest change occurred in phase 2 of the incubation . Principal component analysis ( PCA ) of the Biolog data also showed a change in the distinct clustering of the soil microbial activity , showing that C source from the soil were metabolized differently with time at 21 than at 14 degree C , and between soil horizon . Our result show that Canadian arctic soil contain large store of C , which readily decompose , and that substantial increase in CO2 emission and change in the metabolic diversity of culturable soil microorganism may occur when ambient temperature increase from 14 to 21 degree C .

aVHuman alteration of the environment ha arguably propelled the Earth into it sixth mass extinction event and amphibian , the most threatened of all vertebrate taxon , are at the forefront . Many of the worldwide amphibian decline have been caused by the chytrid fungus , Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis ( Bd ) , and two contrasting hypothesis have been proposed to explain these decline . Positive correlation between global warming and Bd-related decline sparked the chytrid-thermal-optimum hypothesis , which proposes that global warming increased cloud cover in warm year that drove the convergence of daytime and nighttime temperature toward the thermal optimum for Bd growth . In contrast , the spatiotemporal-spread hypothesis state that Bd-related decline are caused by the introduction and spread of Bid , independent of climate change . We provide a rigorous test of these hypothesis by evaluating ( i ) whether cloud cover , temperature convergence , and predicted temperature-dependent Bid growth are significant positive predictor of amphibian extinction in the genus Atelopus and ( ii ) whether spatial structure in the timing of these extinction can be detected without making assumption about the location , timing , or number of Bd emergence . We show that there is spatial structure to the timing of Atelopus slop . extinction but that the cause of this structure remains equivocal , emphasizing the need for further molecular characterization of Bd . We also show that the reported positive multi-decade correlation between Atelopus slop . extinction and mean tropical air temperature in the previous year is indeed robust , but the evidence that it is causal is weak because numerous other variable , including regional banana and beer production , were better predictor of these extinction . Finally , almost all of our finding were opposite to the prediction of the chytrid-thermal-optimum hypothesis . Although climate change is likely to play an important role in worldwide amphibian decline , more convincing evidence is needed of a causal link .

aVIncrease in concentration of various greenhouse gas and their possible contribution to the global warming are becoming a serious concern . Anthropogenic activity such a cultivation of flooded rice and application of waste material , such a sewage sludge which are rich in C and N , a soil amendment could contribute to the increase in emission of greenhouse gas such a methane ( CH4 ) and nitrous oxide ( N2O ) into the atmosphere . Therefore , evaluation of flux of various greenhouse gas from soil amended with sewage sludge is essential to quantify their release into the atmosphere . Two soil with contrasting property ( Candler fine sand [ CFS ] from Florida , and Ogeechee loamy sand [ OLS ] from Savannah , GA ) were amended with varying rate ( 0 , 24.7 , 49.4 , 98.8 , and 148.3 Mg ha ( -1 ) ) of 2 type of sewage sludge ( industrial [ ISS ] and domestic [ DSS ] origin . The amended soil sample were incubated in anaerobic condition at field capacity soil water content in static chamber ( Qopak bottle ) . Gas sample were extracted immediately after amending soil and subsequently on a daily basis to evaluate the emission of CH4 , CO2 and N2O . The result showed that emission rate and cumulative emission of all three gas increased with increasing rate of amendment . Cumulative emission of gas during 25-d incubation of soil amended with different type of sewage sludge decreased in the order : CO2 > N2O > CH4 . The emission of gas wa greater from the soil amended with DSS a compared to that with ISS . This may indicate the presence of either low C and N content or possible harmful chemical in the ISS . The emission of gas wa greater from the CFS a compared to that from the OLS . Furthermore , the result clearly depicted the inhibitory effect of acetylene in both soil by producing more N2O and CH4 emission compared to the soil that did not receive acetylene at the rate of 1 mL g ( -1 ) soil . Enumeration of microbial population by fluorescein diacetate ( FDA ) and most probable number ( MPN ) procedure at the end of 25-d incubation demonstrated a clear relationship between microbial activity and the emission of gas . The result of this study emphasize the need to consider the emission of greenhouse gas from soil amended with organic soil amendment such a sewage sludge , especially at high rate , and their potential contribution to global warming .

aVPhragmites australis ( Cav . ) Trin . ex Steud . ( common reed ) is native to North America and ha always been a minor component of wetland . However , this specie ha undergone a rapid expansion in the northeastern United States and Canada during the last century , to the point of becoming a nuisance in some area ( Mal and Narine 2004 ) . At it northern limit in eastern Canada , it is particularly invasive in canal , waterway , roadside ditch , and wetland ( Hudon et al . 2005 ; Lavoie et al . 2003 ) . There is increasing evidence that this recent expansion wa a consequence of the introduction of a European genotype ( haplotype M ) in the 19th and 20th century ( Lelong et al . 2007 ; Saltonstall 2002 ) . The invasive European haplotype ha been designated a P. australis ( Cav . ) Trin . ex Steud . subsp . australis , while the native haplotype is now referred to a P. australis ( Cav . ) Trin . ex Steud . subsp . americanus Saltonstall , P.M. Peterson & amp ; Soreng ( Saltonstall et al . 2004 ) . Several morphological characteristic such a basal internode color , glume length , and inflorescence morphology have been used to distinguish between the native and introduced subspecies in the field ( Catling 2006 , 2007 ) .

aVChemical risk assessment is fraught with difficulty due to the problem of accounting for the effect of mixture . In addition to the uncertainty arising from chemical-to-chemical interaction , it is possible that environmental variable , such a temperature , influence the biological response to chemical challenge , acting a confounding factor in the analysis of mixture effect . Here , we investigate the effect of temperature on the response of fish to a defined mixture of estrogenic chemical . It wa anticipated that the response to the mixture may be exacerbated at higher temperature , due to an increase in the rate of physiological processing . This is a pertinent issue in view of global climate change . Fathead minnow ( Pimephales promelas ) were exposed to the mixture in parallel exposure study , which were carried out at different temperature ( 20 and 30 degree C ) . The estrogenic response wa characterised using an established assay , involving the analysis of the egg yolk protein , vitellogenin ( VTG ) . Patterns of VTG gene expression were also analysed using real-time QPCR . The result revealed that there wa no effect of temperature on the magnitude of the VTG response after 2 week of chemical exposure . However , the analysis of mixture effect at two additional time point ( 24 h and 7 day ) revealed that the response wa induced more rapidly at the higher temperature . This trend wa apparent from the analysis of effect both at the molecular and biochemical level . Whilst this indicates that climatic effect on water temperature are not a significant issue with regard to the long-term risk assessment of estrogenic chemical , the relevance of short-term effect is , a yet , unclear . Furthermore , analysis of the pattern of VTG gene expression versus protein induction give an insight into the physiological mechanism responsible for temperature-dependent effect on the reproductive phenology of specie such a roach . Hence , the data contribute to our understanding of the implication of global climate change for wild fish population . ( C ) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All right reserved .

aVIn order to document long-term climate trend and predict future climate change for the Arctic , we need to look at the geological record to establish the link between historical and pre-industrial sea-surface parameter . Dinoflagellate cyst ( dinocysts ) are used a proxy indicator of sea-surface parameter ( temperature , salinity , sea-ice cover , primary productivity ) jointly with transfer function and a modern dinocyst reference database , to reconstruct the evolution of sea-surface condition at decadal and multi-decadal timescales . Here we present the fossil dinocyst assemblage established from three sediment core collected along an inshore-offshore transect in the Mackenzie Trough during the 2004 CASES ( Canadian Arctic Shelf Exchange Study ) cruise . The chronology of each core wa determined using Pb-210 activity and AMS-C-14 measurement in core 912A . Sediment core 912A , 909B and 906B cover the last 600,200 and 100 year respectively . Palynomorph influx increase from the bottom to the top of each core , illustrating an increasing productivity over the last similar to 600 year until similar to 1850 AD , when we observe a decrease of productivity until today . We determined a succession of two assemblage over the last similar to 600 year . Assemblage 1 , at the base of each core , is mostly composed of dinocysts from heterotrophic taxon . The modern assemblage ( Assemblage II at the top of each core ) is mostly composed of dinocysts from autotrophic taxon . Quantitative reconstruction of sea-surface parameter reveal a sharp increase in summer ( August ) temperature ( similar to 2 to 5 degree C ) throughout the study area from similar to 1400 AD until similar to 1800-1850 AD , after which the increase ( between similar to 0.5 and 1.0 degree C ) is much slower until modern time .

aVThis paper present a comprehensive spatial model for exploring the interaction between road transportation and environment . The potential negative impact of transportation on environment can be listed a degradation of air quality , greenhouse gas emission , increased threat of global climate change , degradation of water resource , noise and habitat loss and fragmentation . Within this interaction , of particular importance is the relationship between urban structure and transport emission , since it is the urban structure that fundamentally determines transportation demand . Due to the spatial nature of the interaction , Spatial Information Sciences ( SIS ) ha many advantage compared with other system . The developed model integrates data and method on spatial base , detects change , encompasses monitoring and analyzes the interaction . In order to verify the developed concept , a pilot project wa conducted at the southeast part of Istanbul Metropolitan Area , where the development of motorway and it effect to land use category between 1987 and 2001 period wa analyzed . Within the study area , the road transportation network had been doubled , whereas the construction site were tripled within the year of 1987-2001 . A significant decrease wa observed at barren and agricultural land class . Using the suggested model an integrated framework for exploring the interaction wa constituted and the result were discussed .

aVOne of the predicted biological response to climate warming is the upslope displacement of specie distribution . In the tropic , because montane assemblage frequently include local endemic that are distributed close to summit , these specie may be especially vulnerable to experiencing complete habitat loss from warming . However , there is currently a dearth of information available for tropical region . Here , we present a preliminary appraisal of this extinction threat using the herpetological assemblage of the Tsaratanana Massif in northern Madagascar ( the island 's highest massif ) , which is rich with montane endemism . We present meteorological evidence ( individual and combined regional weather station data and reanalysis forecast data ) for recent warming in Madagascar , and show that this trend is consistent with recent climate model simulation . Using standard moist adiabatic lapse rate , these observed meteorological warming trend in northern Madagascar predict upslope specie displacement of 17-74 m per decade between 1993 and 2003 . Over this same period , we also report preliminary data supporting a trend for upslope distribution movement , based on two survey we completed at Tsaratanana . For 30 specie , representing five family of reptile and amphibian , we found overall mean shift in elevational midpoint of 19-51 m upslope ( mean lower elevation limit 29-114 m ; mean upper elevation limit -8 to 53 m ) . We also found upslope trend in mean and median elevational observation in seven and six of nine specie analysed . Phenological difference between these survey do not appear to be substantial , but these upslope shift are consistent with the prediction based on meteorological warming . An elevational range displacement analysis project complete habitat loss for three specie below the 2 degree C 'dangerous ' warming threshold . One of these specie is not contracting it distribution , but the other two were not resampled in 2003 . A preliminary review of the other massif in Madagascar indicates potential similar vulnerability to habitat loss and upslope extinction . Consequently , we urgently recommend additional elevational survey for these and other tropical montane assemblage , which should also include , when possible , the monitoring of local meteorological condition and habitat change .

aVThe musk ox is adapted to extreme cold and regarded a vulnerable to the impact of climate change . Population decline is proposed to occur due to change in forage availability , insect harassment , parasite load , and habitat availability , while the possible role of infectious disease ha not been emphasized . The goal of the present article is to describe an outbreak of fatal pasteurellosis that occurred in the introduced musk ox population of Dovrefjell , Norway in 2006 , causing the death of a large proportion of the animal . The epizootic coincided with extraordinary warm and humid weather , condition that often are associated with outbreak of pasteurellosis . The description is based on long series of data from the surveillance of the musk ox population , weather data from a closely located meteorological station , and pathoanatomical investigation of the diseased animal . It is concluded that the weather condition likely were the decisive factor for the outbreak . It is suggested that such epizootics may occur increasingly among cold-adapted animal if global warming result in increased occurrence of heat wave and associated extreme weather event , thereby causing population decline and possibly extinction .

aVThe use of fossil fuel ha caused an increase in GHG concentration in the atmosphere , which ha a direct effect oil global warming . Among the possible technology to mitigate GHG emission , carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) call be applied to existing , plant and now it is being accepted officially in order to gain emission reduction certificate . This paper present a feasible Solution for CO , capture and storage network in Italy from Sources that are included in the National Allocation Plan and that are forced to reduce carbon dioxide emission in the second phase of the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol . The technical aspect of carbon sequestration are derived from industrial application , while transportation and storage depend on local and geological characteristic . Since Italy ha complex geological characteristic . the selection of the most convenient site should include hydrocarbon reservoir that are Currently used or are depleted . To select these site , all oil well that are located in the Italian territory and are managed by UNMIG ( National Mining Office for Hydrocarbons and Geothermy ) were considered , and a short list wa selected among those that have safety and lasting characteristic to ensure a long time permanence . The position of the selected storage site is drawn on It GIS map containing all the plant included in the National Allocation Plan to be able to identify the optimal network for carbon dioxide transportation . The case study is located in an area that includes Milan , Pavia and Lodi district . Knowing the amount of CO , produced by plant in the selected zone , it is possible to determine the ton of CO2 to capture and the size of transportation and storage system . Pipelines are , in this case , the most appropriate transport technology . From emission and sequestration point to storage site it is necessary to build 122 kill pipeline for 8 MtCO ( 2 ) , capacity . Using this CCS grid it is possible to avoid CO , emission with economic feasibility close to the cost of carbon trading value . In fact , the market cost of a European Union Allowance ( EUA ) at the start of the first period of application of Directive 2003/87/CE wa about 30 is an element of/tCO ( 2 ) .

aVAfter similar to 11,000 year of glacio-isostatically induced forced regression , geomorphological evidence indicates that the coastline of eastern Melville Island , western Canadian Arctic Archipelago , is now being transgressed . Recently developed coastal feature associated with this transgression include : drowned gully and small estuary , barrier and lagoon , barrier island , erosional notch , backstepping beach , and drowned tundra vegetation and vehicle track dating from the 1970s . We mainly attribute this relative sea-level rise to the eastward migration of a peripheral crustal forebulge . Furthermore , the reported transgression also includes a component from recent eustatic sea-level rise during the 20th century . Recent earthquake recorded in the Gustav-Lougheed Arch Seismic Zone located in Byam Martin Channel , 70 km east of Melville Island , suggest that neotectonics could also be involved in local relative sea-level adjustment . Other factor associated with global warming , especially the formation of an earlier shore-ice lead coupled with increased storm activity might also be responsible for some of the coastal change . Our study indicates that the current zero isobase , separating area of net transgression from those of net regression , is now located off the east coast of the island . Our field observation support recent glacio-isostatic modelling that show the island is presently undergoing a transgression . ( C ) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All right reserved .

aVThe phenological behavior of many tropical plant specie is highly dependent on rainfall , but these plant may also respond to change in photoperiod . Without a better knowledge of the proportion of specie responding to different factor , it is difficult to predict how global climate change may affect natural ecosystem process . The aim of this study wa to describe flowering pattern for more than 100 specie in Tinigua Park , Colombia , and to propose which factor may trigger flower production ( e.g. , rainfall , temperature , cloud cover , and photoperiod ) . Data gathered in 5.6 km of phenological transects during 4 yr and complementary information indicated that the vast majority of specie showed intraspecific synchronization , and annual production wa the most common pattern , followed by episodic frequency . The annual pattern were common in tree specie , while episodic pattern were common in liana . Simple and multiple regression analysis suggested several aspect of photoperiod a the most likely trigger for flowering in most specie . However , the fact that many of these specie produce flower in different period each year , suggests that the proportion of specie responding to photoperiodic cue is le that 23 percent in this community . The flowering time of taxonomically related specie seldom showed significantly staggered distribution ; however they do not necessarily occur at the same time , suggesting that flowering pattern are not strongly constrained by phylogeny .

aVQuercus rugosa Nee ( section Quercus ) ha a distribution from the southern United States to Honduras . This study characterized leaf variation across the whole distribution of the specie in Mexico . Ten foliar morphometric character were scored in each of 241 individual from 25 locality . A principal component analysis resolved four principal component ( PCs ) that explained 76.4 % of the total variation . A nested analysis of variance revealed significant difference among population ( 29.2 % average contribution to total variance for the four PCs ) and among-trees within population ( 39.2 % ) , while 31.6 % wa due to intra-individual variation . For the first PC ( related to leaf size ) , 52.1 % resulted from among population difference . This variation wa negatively correlated with latitude ( r = -0.86 ; P < 0.0001 ) , indicating a steep clinal reduction in leaf size from south to north . Mean annual precipitation and an annual aridity index also significantly decreased and increased with latitude , respectively . It is suggested that the morphological cline is the result of plastic and/or adaptive response to environmental condition , and indicative of further ecophysiological latitudinal difference among Q , rugosa population . Additionally , we estimated the magnitude of the least significant difference among population for the first PC and translated it into a delineation of six latitudinal zone ( each with a width of 2 degree 30 ' ) , to be considered a preliminary zone for the movement of Q rugosa seed with management and conservation purpose , including management in response to global warming .

aVAlthough plant are more susceptible to frost damage under elevated atmospheric [ CO ( 2 ) ] , the importance of frost damage under future , warmer climate scenario is unknown . Accordingly , we used a model to examine the incidence and severity of frost damage to snow gum ( Eucalyptus pauciflora ) in a sub-alpine region of Australia for current and future condition using the A2 IPCC elevated CO ( 2 ) and climate change scenario . An existing model for predicting frost effect on E. pauciflora seedling wa adapted to include effect of elevated [ CO ( 2 ) ] on acclimation to freezing temperature , calibrated with field data , and applied to a study region in Victoria using climate scenario data from CSIRO 's Global Climate Model C-CAM for current ( 1975-2004 ) and future ( 2035-2064 ) 30 year climate sequence . Temperatures below 0 degree C were predicted to occur le frequently while the coldest temperature ( i.e . those below -8 degree C ) were almost a common in the future a in the current climate . Both elevated [ CO ( 2 ) ] and climate warming affected the timing and rate of acclimation and de-acclimation of snow gum to freezing temperature , potentially reducing the length of time that plant are fully frost tolerant and increasing the length of the growing season . Despite fewer day when temperature fall below 0 degree C in the future , with consequently fewer damaging frost with lower average level of impact , individual weather sequence resulting in widespread plant mortality may still occur . Furthermore , delayed acclimation due to either warming or rising [ CO ( 2 ) ] combined with an early severe frost could lead to more frost damage and higher mortality than would occur in current condition . Effects of elevated [ CO ( 2 ) ] on frost damage were greater in autumn , while warming had more effect in spring . Thus , frost damage will continue to be a management issue for plantation and forest management in region where frost persist .

aVWhether you worry about man-made global warming due to the burning of fossil fuel , or not , you have to face up to the fact that the supply of crude oil that we convert to petrol and diesel is finite , and the time when it will no longer be possible to match supply with demand is not so far away . Projections vary , but even the most optimistic do not predict much more than 20 year . For this reason we need to start looking very seriously at way we can fuel our vehicle in a post-crude-oil future . Hydrogen is a popular option , but is it a realistic one ? Do n't the Brazilians run their car on alcohol ? Is that a strategy we could apply world wide ? And what about battery powered vehicle ? Is that just for golf cart ? The answer , a it turn out , is not to go for a single option , rather we will have to employ a combination of some of these technology to keep u on the road .

aVGlobal warming projection experiment were conducted using a 20-km mesh global atmospheric model ( the 20-km model ) , focusing on the change in the rain band of the East Asian summer monsoon ( the Baiu rain band in Japan ) . To quantify the dependence of the projected change on the sea surface temperature ( SST ) prescribed to the 20-km model , we have taken different SSTs given by the two Atmospheric-Ocean General Circulation Model ( AOGCM ) s of MRI-CGCM2.3.2 and MIROC ( hire ) . In the future climate simulation , the Intergovermental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) A1B emission scenario wa assumed . The future climate simulation show that precipitation and it intensity increase over the Yangtze River valley of China and Western Japan . The termination of the Baiu season tends to be delayed until August . These change were consistently found in the simulation regardless of different SSTs .

Two fuel , Fischer-Tropsch diesel ( FTD ) and dimethyl ether ( I ) ME ) , produced from either straw or short-rotation willow coppice ( Salix ) , were studied . The environmental impact , land use and energy balance were calculated using life-cycle methodology . It wa calculated that the straw-based system had only 32-39 % of the impact on global warming ( kg [ CO2-eq ] ) compared to the Salix-based system . For acidification and eutrophication , the difference between the system were le significant . The energy balance were 8.9 and 9.6 for FTD and 10.1 and 10.0 for DME , from straw and Salix , respectively . To become self-sufficient in FTD , 108 ha ha to be set aside for Salix production or 261 ha of straw collected from the existing crop rotation . For DME the corresponding figure are 38 and 70 ha . The many by-product in the FTD scenario explain the large difference between fuel . Comparing FTD and DME , the difference in environmental impact were small . Considering this , FTD is a more likely alternative since DME requires a pressurised infrastructure system and engine modification . ( c ) 2007 IAgrE . Published by Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVEven though singing play a major role in bird communication , environmental variable affecting the geographic pattern observed in the variation of singing onset within large area have not previously been studied . The singing phenology of two long-distance migrant , the Cuckoo Cuculus canorus and the Nightingale Luscinia megarhynchos , recorded in thousand of site throughout Spain , wa related to a set of 51 explanatory variable by partial least square regression . Observed variability in singing onset among locality follows spatial trend on an Iberian scale at 10 x 10 km resolution , and wa well modelled by some environmental variable . Of these variable , climate wa the most influential . Males of both specie sang earlier in wanner and drier site . Males who were near the Straits of Gibraltar and in the southern Iberian basin , which are geographic gradient closely related with climate in the Iberian Peninsula , were also heard earlier . Most environmental variable affected the singing activity of both specie equally , i.e. , the same environmental gradient are linked to singing onset . However , the model ' prediction indicated difference in the geographical pattern in singing onset between both specie , mainly related to their rate of progression during spring migration through Spain . Local variable , such a land us , vegetation productivity or specie abundance , played a minor role on singing onset spatial pattern . Therefore , model ' composition support the hypothesis that singing onset is a good proxy of arrival date in migratory specie , since those variable related to indirect effect on singing onset phenology through migratory progression and arrival to the breeding ground showed the highest influence .

aVWe examined climate-carbon cycle feedback by performing a global warming experiment using MIROC-based coupled climate-carbon cycle model . The model showed that by the end of the 21st century , warming lead to a further increase in carbon dioxide ( CO ( 2 ) ) level of 123 ppm by volume ( ppmv ) . This positive feedback can mostly be attributed to land-based soil-carbon dynamic . On a regional scale , Siberia experienced intense positive feedback , because the acceleration of microbial respiration due to warming cause a decrease in the soil carbon level . Amazonia also had positive feedback resulting from accelerated microbial respiration . On the other hand , some region , such a western and central North America and South Australia , experienced negative feedback , because enhanced litterfall surpassed the increased respiration in soil carbon . The oceanic contribution to the feedback wa much weaker than the land contribution on global scale , but the positive feedback in the northern North Atlantic wa a strong a those in Amazonia and Siberia in our model . In the northern North Atlantic , the weakening of winter mixing caused a reduction of CO ( 2 ) absorption at the surface . Moreover , weakening of the formation of North Atlantic Deep Water caused reduced CO ( 2 ) subduction to the deep water . Understanding such regional-scale difference may help to explain disparity in coupled climate-carbon cycle model result .

aVWe report the discovery of exceptionally large biogenic magnetite crystal in clay-rich sediment spanning the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum ( PETM ) in a borehole at Ancora , NJ . Aside from previously described abundant bacterial magnetofossils , electron microscopy reveals novel spearhead-like and spindle-like magnetite up to 4 mu m long and hexaoctahedral prism up to 1.4 mu m long . Similar to magnetite produced by magnetotactic bacteria , these single-crystal particle exhibit chemical composition , lattice perfection , and oxygen isotope consistent with an aquatic origin . Electron holography indicates single-domain magnetization despite their large crystal size . We suggest that the development of a thick suboxic zone with high iron bioavailability-a product of dramatic change in weathering and sedimentation pattern driven by severe global warming-drove diversification of magnetite-forming organism , likely including eukaryote .

aVLivestock production is a possible approach to alleviate poverty especially for the rural poor . However , while the sector gain intensity , problem attendant to it such a soil and water pollution , animal health and disease , nutrient loading and contribution to global warming also increased . Failure to address these problem will create greater harm on people 's health and the environment . This study commissioned by FAO , aim to provide an objective assessment of environmental animal health and production in Laguna , Philippines , in both qualitative and quantitative term , a a baseline for future temporal and spatial comparison . Using Geo-Information System a a tool with secondary data collection and survey a mean to collect the input data , overlay map were created . The use of animal unit density of livestock and poultry farm wa also developed to determine the hotspot area in term of production , health and disease , nutrient loading and contribution to global warming . As a result , the study wa able to ( 1 ) map distribution , quantity , and density , ( 2 ) identify trend and pattern , and ( 3 ) delineate hotspot , which aided significantly in studying livestock and environment interaction in Laguna Province .

aVGlobal change , including an increase in trade and global warming , which act on the environment , are likely to impact on the evolution of pathogen and hence of disease . To anticipate the risk created by this new situation , a French group of expert ha developed a method for prioritising animal health risk . This is a two-phase method : the first step is to identify the disease whose incidence or geographical distribution could be affected by the change taking place , and the second step is to evaluate the risk of each of these disease . As a result of this process , six priority disease were selected : bluetongue , Rift Valley fever , West Nile fever , visceral leishmaniasis , leptospirosis and African horse sickness . The main recommendation were : to develop epidemiological surveillance , to increase knowledge of epidemiological cycle , to develop research into these disease and to pool cross-border effort to control them .

aVGlobal warming potential are estimated for hydrofluoroethers , which are an emerging class of compound for industrial use . Comparisons are made to the limited data previously available before observation about molecular design are discussed . We quantify how molecular structure can be manipulated to reduce environmental impact due to global warming . We further highlight the need for additional research on this class of compound so environmental performance can be assessed for green design .

aVThis paper provides an outline of the global warming projection made using the atmosphere-ocean coupled model CCSM3 . Results show that even if the concentration of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere is stabilized , the temperature and sea level will continue to rise over the next few hundred year , and that hysteresis effect appear in sea level change depending on the pathway of the concentration in future . It will become increasingly important that , in our future activity , we fully consider adaptation to climate change in addition to attempting to mitigate the global warming ( through emission reduction ) .

aVThis paper examines the aggregate net cost and individual country cost saving of greenhouse gas emission trading among Pacific Rim country . We propose emission permit allocation rule designed to entice developing country to participate . Absence of developing country involvement ha served a an excuse for the lack by participation by the United States in the first compliance period of the Kyoto Protocol and may serve a a disincentive to even more country in subsequent period . Our analysis specifies permit allocation rule that could result in no net cost , and even cost-savings , to developing country for their involvement in the emission trading market , while at the same time providing extensive benefit to industrialized country through access to lower-cost mitigation alternative .

aVAgainst a background of increasing human population in developing country , and global climate change , conservation of tropical forest remains one of the most important ecological challenge of our time . One of the biggest difficulty for ecologically sustainable management of tropical forest is obtaining reliable growth data for tree , which is a prerequisite for determining harvesting volume and cutting cycle . GOL is the first concept for sustainable management of tropical timber resource in Amazonian floodplain forest ( varzea ) based on species-specific management criterion , such a minimum logging diameter ( MLDs ) and cutting cycle . From timber specie with varying wood density of different successional stage , volume stock have been estimated in 1-ha plot and 12 growth model have been developed based on tree ring , which are annually formed a a consequence of the regular , long-term flooding . The MLDs of timber specie vary between 47 and 70 cm and the estimated cutting cycle differ the 10-fold , from 3 to 32 year . These enormous difference in the growth rate between tropical timber specie are not considered in current management practice , which apply only one diameter cutting limit and one cutting cycle to harvest many tree specie . This practice risk the overexploitation of slow-growing timber specie , while the fast-growing timber specie with low wood density can not be efficiently used . Based on the timber stock and lifetime growth rate , the GOL concept ha been created a an aid to improve forest management in the Central Amazonian varzea . The model is unique for tropical silviculture . ( C ) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All right reserved .

aVPredicting change in potential habitat for endangered specie a a result of global warming requires considering more than future climate condition ; it is also necessary to evaluate biotic association . Most distribution model predicting specie response to climate change include climate variable and occasionally topographic and edaphic parameter , rarely are biotic interaction included . Here , we incorporate biotic interaction into niche model to predict suitable habitat for specie under altered climate . We constructed and evaluated niche model for an endangered butterfly and a threatened bird specie , both are habitat specialist restricted to semiarid shrublands of southern California . To incorporate their dependency on shrub , we first developed climate-based niche model for shrubland vegetation and individual shrub specie . We also developed model for the butterfly 's larval host plant . Outputs from these model were included in the environmental variable dataset used to create butterfly and bird niche model . For both animal specie , abiotic-biotic model outperformed the climate-only model , with climate-only model over-predicting suitable habitat under current climate condition . We used the climate-only and abiotic-biotic model to calculate amount of suitable habitat under altered climate and to evaluate specie ' sensitivity to climate change . We varied temperature ( +0.6 , +1.7 , and +2.8 degree C ) and precipitation ( 50 % , 90 % , 100 % , 110 % , and 150 % ) relative to current climate average and within range predicted by global climate change model . Suitable habitat for each specie wa reduced at all level of temperature increase . Both specie were sensitive to precipitation change , particularly increase . Under altered climate , including biotic variable reduced habitat by 68-100 % relative to the climate-only model . To design reserve system conserving sensitive specie under global warming , it is important to consider biotic interaction , particularly for habitat specialist and specie with strong dependency on other specie .

aVGlobal temperature have increased 0.6 degree C over the past century ; however regional temperature have shown greater fluctuation . Since local environmental condition vary along latitudinal cline , latitude ha become an essential component in projecting plant response to warming . Three ecotypes of Arabidopsis were selected from varying latitude in order to investigate heat stress within an ecotype and project potential effect across a gradient . Control and heat stressed group received 12 hour photoperiods . Control plant were grown at 2.7/22.7 degree C day/night mean temperature and heat stressed plant were grown at 22.7/29 degree C day/night mean temperature . Plants were quantified and harvested 35 day after sowing . The number of rosette leaf , flower bud , and fruit resulted in significant difference both between control and heat stressed plant of the same ecotype and also across ecotypes . Heat overwhelmingly resulted in a quantitative decrease across all parameter , including overall plant size , with the exception of flower in ecotype 902 . And even though the heat stressed 902 plant flowered while the control group plant did not , neither produced fruit . Thus , heat adversely affect growth and development a well a reproductive success in Arabidopsis .

aVNitric oxide ( NO ) is a gas displaying multiple physiological function in plant , animal and bacteria . The enzyme nitrate reductase and NO synthase have been suggested to be involved in the production of NO in plant and algae , but the implication of those enzyme in NO production under physiological condition remains obscure . Symbiodinium microadriaticum , commonly referred to a zooxanthellae , is a marine microalga commonly found in symbiotic association with a cnidarian host including reef-building coral . Here we demonstrate NO production in zooxanthellae upon supplementation of either sodium nitrite or L-arginine a a substrate . The nitrite-dependent NO production wa detected electrochemically and confirmed by the application of 2- ( 4-carboxyphenyl ) -4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide ( cPTIO ) , a specific NO scavenger . Cells stained with the diaminofluorescein , DAF-2 DA , an NO fluorescent probe , showed an increase in fluorescence intensity upon supplementation of both sodium nitrite and L-arginine . Microscopic observation of DAF-stained cell verified that NO wa produced inside the cell . NO production in S. microadriaticum wa found to increase upon exposure of cell to an acute heat stress which also caused a decline in the photosynthetic efficiency of PSII ( F ( v ) /F ( m ) ) . This study provides substantial evidence to confirm that zooxanthellae can synthesize NO even when they are not in a symbiotic association with a coral host . The increase in NO production at high temperature suggests that heat stress stimulates the microalgal NO production in a temperature-dependent manner . The implication of these finding are discussed in the light of the coral bleaching phenomenon which is associated with elevated sea surface temperature due to global warming .

aVThe infection of melon plant by Melon necrotic spot virus ( MNSV ) and the development of necrotic disease symptom are a seasonal occurrence in Japan , which take place between winter and early summer , but not during mid-summer . In this paper we investigate the effect of three different temperature ( 15 , 20 , and 25 degree C ) on the local and systemic expression of MNSV in melon plant . Previously , the incidence of plant expressing systemic symptom caused by MNSV and other virus wa found to be greater at temperature le than 20 degree C. In this study , our temperature-shift experiment support previous study that found the expression of systemic symptom increase a temperature fall from 25 to 20 degree C and decrease a temperature rise from 20 to 25 degree C. However , MNSV replication in melon cell and local viral movement within leaf following the inoculation of melon protoplast or cotyledon were more frequent at 25 degree C than at 15 or 20 degree C .

aV1 . The occurrence of different specie of seal ( Phocidae ) during the Holocene in north-eastern Europe wa influenced by a changing geological situation over the last 12 000 year , characterized by alternating freshwater , brackish and marine stage and by spatially and temporally limited opportunity for migration of marine specie into the Baltic basin . The pattern of immigration by ringed seal Phoca hispida , harp seal Phoca groenlandica , grey seal Halichoerus grypus and harbour seal Phoca vitulina are reviewed here in order to understand present distribution and population size . Furthermore , the future of their population is analysed . 2 . Phoca hispida immigrated into the Baltic basin during it brackish Yoldia Stage at the Late Glacial/Early Holocene boundary and ha persisted in some disjunct population until now . A second immigration followed at the beginning of the Littorina Transgression - which resulted in the present stage of the Baltic Sea , obviously caused by the strong cooling event that occurred 6200 calibrated ( 14 ) C year BC . Its present status is not threatened , but global warming will restrict suitable habitat . 3 . Phoca groenlandica had a mid-Holocene intermezzo in the Baltic Sea . Its later disappearance wa probably caused by hunting of subadult animal by human . 4 . Halichoerus grypus and Phoca vitulina also immigrated at the beginning of the present stage of the Baltic Sea . Whereas H. grypus ha been common from this beginning point until modern time , the population of P. vitulina persisted at a low level for millennium . Only since the 18th century ha it population increased and spread over the whole Baltic Sea .

aV1 . First flowering date are occurring earlier than they did in the past in many location around the world . It is sometimes assumed , implicitly or explicitly , that the change in first flowering date describe the phenological behaviour of entire population . However , first flowering date represent one extreme of the flowering distribution and may be susceptible to undesirable confounding effect . 2 . We used observation of flowering in Colorado and Massachusetts to test whether change in population size and sampling frequency affect observation of first flowering date . 3 . We found that the effect of population size on first flowering date depended on location . Changes in population size were strongly related to the date on which first flowering wa observed in Massachusetts but not in Colorado . The lack of a significant effect in Colorado may reflect the rapid onset of spring after snowmelt and fixed developmental schedule of the plant at this sub-alpine site , or the scale of the plot sampled during the study . 4 . We also found that change in sampling frequency can influence observed change in first flowering date and other aspect of the flowering distribution . Similar to the effect of decline in population size , lower sampling frequency caused later observation of first flowering . However , lower sampling frequency , if maintained consistently throughout a study , did not significantly affect estimate of change in flowering date over time or in response to climate . 5 . Synthesis . Researchers should consider the effect of change in population size and sampling frequency when interpreting change in first flowering date . In some case , past result may need to be reinterpreted . When possible , researcher should observe the entire flowering distribution or consider tracking peak or mean flowering date to avoid the confounding effect of population size and sampling frequency .

aVEmbryo survival and hatch rate were measured in black bream Acanthopagrus butcheri exposed to different treatment of dissolved oxygen : hypoxic and normoxic , three salinity : 15 , 23 and 35 and two temperature : 16 and 20 degree C. Hypoxic condition ( 50 % saturation ) reduced 1 day embryo survival by up to 15 % ( P 80 % saturation ) condition . Temperature had no effect on the survival of embryo in these treatment , however , lowered salinity significantly reduced embryo survival at 20 degree C , but not at 16 degree C. Mean hatch rate were reduced by 10-28 % in hypoxic treatment ( P < 0.05 ) and lowered salinity treatment ( P < 0.05 ) . Hatching wa delayed by up to 24 h at 16 degree C and very low ( or zero ) hatching occurred in hypoxic treatment at salinity of 15 and 23 . These result confirm that environmental condition in estuary are important factor in determining spawning success of black bream and are discussed in relation to global warming and climate change that are likely to alter the physical condition in southern Australian estuary .

aVRemotely sensed data are combined with shipboard measurement to investigate biogeochemical change caused by a moderate tropical cyclone in the central Arabian Sea in December 1998 . The sea surface temperature decreased by similar to 4 degree C , whereas surface nitrate and chlorophyll concentration increased by > 5 mu M and up to 4 mg m ( -3 ) , respectively , over a large area affected by the cyclone . Nutrient enrichment in the surface layer of the cyclone-affected zone is estimated to have supported a new production of similar to 4.2 Tg C , approximately 5 % of the annual organic carbon export to the deep sea ( beyond the continental margin ) for the entire Arabian Sea . Entrainment of nitrous oxide from the thermocline led to more than doubling of it concentration in the mixed layer . The cyclone also resulted in an increase in nitrous oxide inventory within the oxygen minimum zone . Our result imply that , should there be an increase in the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclone a a result of global warming , a projected in some recent report , carbon production and respiration , and redox process within the oxygen minimum zone , such a the production of nitrous oxide through nitrification/denitrification , and of molecular nitrogen through denitrification/anaerobic ammonium oxidation , may be significantly impacted .

aVClimate change scenario are based on numerical model with finite spatial and temporal resolution . The impact of unresolved process is parameterized without taking the variability induced by subscale process into account . This drawback could lead to an over-/underestimation of the climate sensitivity . The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of small-scale atmospheric fluctuation on the modeled climate sensitivity to increased CO ( 2 ) concentration . Using a complex coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model ( ECHAM5/MPI-OM ) climate response experiment with enhanced small-scale fluctuation are performed . Our result show that the strength of the global warming due to a CO2 doubling depends on the representation of small-scale fluctuation . Reducing the horizontal diffusion by a factor of 3 lead to an increase of the equilibrium climate sensitivity by 13 % . If white noise is added to the small scale , the climate sensitivity tends to weaken . The largest change in response occur in the upper troposphere .

aVWe investigated long-term change in coastal zooplankton in the upwelling region in the Gulf of Guinea , 1969 - 1992 , in relation to climatic and biotic factor . We considered the role of hydrographic and climatic factor , i.e . sea surface temperature ( SST ) , salinity , sea level pressure , windfield , and Southern Oscillation Index ( SOI ) , in the long-term variation of zooplankton in a multiple regression analysis , along with the abundance of Sardinella . Annual variation in zooplankton biomass wa cyclical , with the annual peak occurring during the major upwelling season , July-September . Over the 24-year period , there wa a downward trend in zooplankton biomass ( equivalent to 6.33 ml per 1000 m ( 3 ) per year ) . The decomposed trend in SST during the major upwelling revealed gradual warming of surface water . This trend wa believed to be the main influence on the abundance of the large copepod Calanoides carinatus ( sensitive to temperature above 23 degree C ) , which appears in the coastal water only during the major upwelling season . The warming trend associated with global climate change could affect zooplankton community structure , especially during the major upwelling season . Global warming coupled with `` top-down '' ( predation ) control by Sardinella might be responsible for the long-term decline in zooplankton biomass in the upwelling region of the Gulf of Guinea .

aVA remedy called `` geo-engineering solution '' ha been recently proposed by some scientist to handle the global warming problem through injection of sulfate high aloft into the stratosphere . However , this idea may have some other side impact . We have investigated the perturbation caused by geo-engineering solution on the stratospheric charged specie using a coupled neutral-ion photochemical model . Model calculation indicate additional production of sulfuric acid immediately after the injection which further lead to increased abundance of heavy negative ion family by several order of magnitude over the ambient . After 2 month , most of the H ( 2 ) SO ( 4 ) vapor condensed to H ( 2 ) SO ( 4 ) aerosol and the density of charged aerosol increase several fold and the effect spread further in the tropic . The perturbation in ionic specie spread globally after about 1 year but became weaker in magnitude . The ion perturbation ha implication on the electrical property of the atmospheric medium .

aVThe natural climate variability may be masked by the anthropogenic made global warming , today . With a warmer climate , drought and excess rainfall condition could become more frequent and longer lasting . The potential increase of the hazard result stress and high cost in cereal production . For this reason a long-term study wa conducted on a sandy acidic lessivated brown forest soil ; WRB : Haplic Luvisol in the 44 year old Nyirlugos Field Trial ( NYFT ) in a Hungarian fragile agroecosystem in Nyirseg region ( N : 470 41 ' 60 , and E : 220 2 ' 80 ) on triticale ( x Triticosecale Wittm . ) yield between 1999 and 2006 . In 1962 , at the trial set up the soil had the following agrochemical property : pH ( H2O ) 5.9 , pH ( KCl ) 4.7 , hydrolytic acidity 8.4 , hy 10.3 , humus 0.7 % , total N 34 mg kg ( -1 ) , ammonlactate ( AL ) soluble-P2O5 43 mg kg ( -1 ) , AL-K2O 60 mg kg ( -1 ) in the plowed ( 0-25 cm ) layer . The trial consisted of 32 x 4 = 128 plot in randomised block design . The gross plot size wa 10 x 5 = 50 m ( 2 ) . The average fertilizer rate in kg ha ( -1 ) year ( -1 ) were nitrogen 75 , phosphorus 90 ( P2O5 ) , potassium 90 ( K2O ) , calcium 437.5 ( CaCO3 ) and magnesium 140 ( MgCO3 ) . The groundwater table had at a depth of 2-3 m below the surface . During drought condition the respective yield of the control area wa -25 % le than for average year . The application N alone or NP and NK treatment led to yield reduction of -19.7 % , while that of NPK , NPKCa , NPKMg and NPKCaMg caused an -28.3 % yield drop . In the wet year the yield decreased by -22.2 % on the unfertilized soil ; in case of the N , NP and NK nutrition the yield dropped with an -14.1 % ; and the yield increased at 13.8 % on NPK , NPKCa , NPKMg and NPKCaMg treated plot . Yield dropped in the very wettest year -43.1 % on control soil ; -39.3 % of N , NP and NK loading , and -35.8 % on NPK , NPKCa , NPKMg and NPKCaMg treatment to those in the average year . The relationship between rainfall quantity during the vegetation period and N , P , K , Ca , Mg nutrition and yield wa characterised by polynomial correlation ( control : R = 0.7212*** , N : R = 0.7410*** , NP : R = 0.6452*** , NK : R = 0.6998*** , NPK : R = 0.5555*** , NPKCa : R = 0.5578*** , NPKMg : R = 0.4869** , NPKCaMg : R = 0.4341** ) . However , total regression coefficient ranged from 0.43 to 0.74 in depence on the different nutrient application . Maximum yield of 5.8-6.0 t ha ( -1 ) were achieved in the rainfall range of 580-620 mm . At value above and below this domain of the precipitation the grain yield reduced quadratically . So , it can be stated that both drought and excess rainfall condition resulted dramatically significant negative effect between fertilization ( N , P , K , Ca , Mg ) and triticale yield .

aVMeteorological-driven process exert large and diverse impact on lake and their water quality ; these impact can be hydrologic , thermal , hydraulic , chemical , biochemical , or ecological . The impact of climate change on Lake Tahoe ( California-Nevada ) wa investigated here a a case study of climate change effect on the physical process occurring within lake . The already published trend of meteorological variable were used to ass the effect of global warming on Lake Tahoe dynamic . Records from the period 1969-2002 show that Lake Tahoe ha became warmer and more stable . A series of simulation year into the future ( i.e. , 2000-2040 ) wa established using flow , load , and meteorology data set for the period 1994-2004 . Results of 40-year simulation show that the lake continues to become warmer and more stable , and mixing is reduced . Possible change in water quality because of global warming are discussed through inference , although these are not specifically simulated . Many existing problem may be exacerbated due to climate change , yet extreme uncertainty depends on the rate and magnitude of climate change . Therefore , shift in water quality and quantity due to climate change should be integrated into contemporary planning and management in an adaptive manner , and the research and development of impact assessment methodology should focus on approach that can handle extreme uncertainty . The general alternative for lake management due to climate change are discussed . Depending on the specific case , further intensive research is suggested to restore lake water quality .

aVThe impact of anthropogenic climate change on terrestrial organism is often predicted to increase with latitude , in parallel with the rate of warming . Yet the biological impact of rising temperature also depends on the physiological sensitivity of organism to temperature change . We integrate empirical fitness curve describing the thermal tolerance of terrestrial insect from around the world with the projected geographic distribution of climate change for the next century to estimate the direct impact of warming on insect fitness across latitude . The result show that warming in the tropic , although relatively small in magnitude , is likely to have the most deleterious consequence because tropical insect are relatively sensitive to temperature change and are currently living very close to their optimal temperature . In contrast , specie at higher latitude have broader thermal tolerance and are living in climate that are currently cooler than their physiological optimum , so that warming may even enhance their fitness . Available thermal tolerance data for several vertebrate taxon exhibit similar , pattern , suggesting that these result are general for terrestrial ectotherm . Our analysis imply that , in the absence of ameliorating factor such a migration and adaptation , the greatest extinction risk from global warming may be in the tropic , where biological diversity is also greatest .

aVIncreasing consensus about the end of cheap oil , the consequence of global warming and the need for rural development are catalyzing the expansion of biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel . While most nation are promoting the expansion of conventional crop , India 's strategy for biofuels is to promote Jatropha curcas , a drought-tolerant , perennial crop with little prior commercial track record . The aim of this paper is three-fold . ( 1 ) To compare the characteristic of various crop with their potential a biofuels in order to ass the relative advantage and disadvantage of Jatropha curcas . ( 2 ) To analyze the implication of current biofuel policy for food supply , agricultural water demand and the rural poor . ( 3 ) To highlight briefly some alternative strategy that can overcome drawback in the current strategy . One conclusion is that although Jatropha curcas ha a low water requirement , which is an important benefit , it ha several other disadvantage . Another recommendation that emerges from this paper is that biofuel policy should also focus on short-duration , multi-purpose and proven drought-tolerant crop like sweet sorghum that can be adopted by small landholder while wasteland rehabilitation policy should focus on broader array of option , which can provide greater direct benefit to the rural poor .

aVOwing to concern about energy security and because of increased environmental awareness , the biofuel industry is expanding worldwide . it is therefore extremely important to be able to quantify the sustainability of biofuels in order to determine their benefit over using conventional fossil fuel derived transport fuel . This study investigates the total energy requirement and global warming potential ( GWP ) of the production of biodiesel from oilseed rape in the UK , using life cycle analysis . Large- and small-scale production are compared and the sensitivity of these environmental impact to production variable investigated . Possible change to the process are considered , with a view to reduce the energy requirement and global warming potential . This research show that the scale of the production of biodiesel from oilseed rape in the UK , and the transport involved in the various stage of manufacture , ha little effect on it global warming potential . It is also shown that if the rape meal and glycerol were combusted in combined heat and power plant , and the rate of application of nitrogenous fertiliser were reduced from 211 kg/ha to 100 kg/ha , the energy requirement and global warming potential saving from using biodiesel rather than ultra low sulphur diesel would increase dramatically , to 170 % and 120 % , respectively , on a basis of equivalent net energy content .

aVRecent global environmental and social change have created a set of `` wicked problem '' for which there are no optimal solution . In this article , we illustrate the wicked nature of such problem by describing the effect of global warming on the wildfire regime and indigenous community in Alaska , and we suggest an approach for minimizing negative impact and maximizing positive outcome . Warming ha led to an increase in the areal extent of wildfire in Alaska , which increase fire risk to rural indigenous community and reduces short-term subsistence opportunity . Continuing the current fire suppression policy would minimize these negative impact , but it would also create secondary problem near community associated with fuel buildup and contribute to a continuing decline in subsistence opportunity . Collaborations between community and agency to harvest flammable fuel for heating and electrical power generation near community , and to use wild land fire for habitat enhancement in surrounding forest , could reduce community vulnerability to both the direct and the indirect effect of global climate change .

aVAim Tree-line conifer are believed to be limited by temperature worldwide , and thus may serve a important indicator of climate change . The purpose of this study wa to examine the potential shift in spatial distribution of three tree-line conifer specie in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem under three future climate-change scenario and to ass their potential sensitivity to change in both temperature and precipitation . Location This study wa performed using data from 275 site within the boundary of Yellowstone and Grand Teton national park , primarily located in Wyoming , USA . Methods We used data on tree-line conifer presence from the US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis Program . Climatic and edaphic variable were derived from spatially interpolated map and approximated for each of the site . We used the random-forest prediction method to build a model of predicted current and future distribution of each of the specie under various climate-change scenario . Results We had good success in predicting the distribution of tree-line conifer specie currently and under future climate scenario . Temperature and temperature-related variable appeared to be most influential in the distribution of whitebark pine ( Pinus albicaulis ) , whereas precipitation and soil variable dominated the model for subalpine fir ( Abies lasiocarpa ) and Engelmann spruce ( Picea engelmannii ) . The model for whitebark pine substantially overpredicted absence ( a compared with the other model ) , which is probably a result of the importance of biological factor in the distribution of this specie . Main conclusion These model demonstrate the complex response of conifer distribution to changing climate scenario . Whitebark pine is considered a 'keystone ' specie in the subalpine forest of western North America ; however , it is believed to be nearly extinct throughout a substantial portion of it range owing to the combined effect of an introduced pathogen , outbreak of the native mountain pine beetle ( Dendroctonus ponderosae ) , and changing fire regime . Given predicted change in climate , it is reasonable to predict an overall decrease in pine-dominated subalpine forest in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem . In order to manage these forest effectively with respect to future climate , it may be important to focus attention on monitoring dry mid- and high-elevation forest a harbinger of long-term change .

aVClimate influence butterfly both directly and through impact on their food plant and habitat . We look at the relationship between climate and butterfly in the Aullwood Audubon Center , west central Ohio , using the weekly Long-Term Butterfly Monitoring ( LTBM ) survey ( April through October 2000-2006 ) and the annual fourth of July count ( 1989-2006 ) . The 18 annual Fourth of July survey yielded 20,709 butterfly and 59 specie . The number of individual though not specie decreased over time . Most but not all of that decrease wa from a large drop in Pieris rapae L. ( Pieridae ) . The number of individual wa greatest when the previous and current growing season were cool and winter precipitation high . Individual specie varied in their response to climate . Recent year have been warmer ( all season ) and have had drier winter than earlier year . The 7 yr of weekly LTBM survey recorded 5,784 butterfly and 58 specie . The total number of individual ha not changed significantly over time . The weather of the day of sampling had some effect : the total number of specie wa highest on clear day with some wind . The result over the 18 yr are compatible with the hypothesis that global warming ha led to a decrease in the number of butterfly . Habitat change can not be excluded a an alternate hypothesis , but these effect seem minor . The value of a large , environmentally heterogeneous natural area like Aullwood is that it buffer short-term climatic and weather condition to provide long-term stability for a diverse butterfly community .

aVSF6 gas is widely used in electric power apparatus such a gas-insulated switchgears ( GIS ) , because of it superior dielectric property ; however , it ha been identified a a greenhouse gas at COP3 in 1997 , and alternative insulation gas to SF6 have recently been investigated . One of the candidate is CO2 gas , which ha lower global warming potential ( GWP ) . However , CO2 gas ha a lower withstand voltage level than SF6 gas ; therefore , it is necessary to rationalize the equipment insulation level and reexamine the insulating test voltage for electric power apparatus a low a possible . From our previous investigation , in SF6 gas insulation system , we obtained that the insulation requirement of the real surge ( called nonstandard lightning impulse waveform ) are not a severe a those of the standard lightning impulse waveform . This paper describes the evaluation method for real surge , based on insulation characteristic of CO2 gas gap . Furthermore , the method wa applied to typical field overvoltage waveform in the lightning surge time region for 500-kV system and it is obtained that the equivalent peak value of the standard lightning impulse waveform is possibly reduced by 10 to 15 % .

aVSustainable decision in water resource management require scientifically sound information on water availability . Central support in hydrological decision making arises from hydrological modelling which in turn depends on meteorological input . This work intends to show how integration of atmospheric science and hydrology , particularly the joint modelling of atmospheric and terrestrial water cycle , allows to provide decision support for two fundamental problem in sustainable water management : ( 1 ) the impact of global climate change on water availability , and ( 2 ) the near-real time estimation of recent resource and flux . The performance of joint atmospheric-hydrological simulation and it application for decision support is demonstrated for the Volta Basin of West Africa . First , the impact of global warming on water availability in the Volta Basin is assessed by joint regional climate-hydrology simulation . Time slice of ECHAM4 global climate scenario IS92a are dynamically downscaled to a resolution of 9 x 9 km ( 2 ) with the mesoscale meteorological model MM5 and the terrestrial water balance is subsequently calculated by the distributed hydrological model WaSiM . Results indicate a slight increase in total annual precipitation by 5 % , but also a significant decrease of precipitation in April ( in total 20 % , for specific region up to 70 % ) , at the beginning of the rainy season . Terrestrial water balance variable react highly nonlinear to change in precipitation and temperature . Second , the performance of joint atmospheric-hydrological simulation a a tool for near-real-time , model based water monitoring system for the White Volta subcatchment is assessed . Operational available GFS ( Global Forecasting System ) global analysis are dynamically downscaled to 9 x 9 km ( 2 ) resolution and meteorological field subsequently applied for calculating the terrestrial water balance . Albeit a bias in precipitation simulation can be observed when comparing to point measurement , modelled river discharge agrees well with observation in 2004 . It is concluded that particularly in area with weak infrastructure , where few meteorological observation are available ( or only in long delay ) , atmospheric model can provide reasonable meteorological information for hydrological modelling and therefore facilitate decision support .

aVWe compiled a large data-set from 22 cruise spanning from 1991 to 2003 , of the partial pressure of CO2 ( pCO ( 2 ) ) in surface water over the continental shelf ( CS ) and adjacent open ocean ( 43 degree to 46 degree S ; 145 degree to 150 degree E ) , south of Tasmania . Climatological seasonal cycle of pCO ( 2 ) in the CS , the subtropical zone ( STZ ) and the subAntarctic zone ( SAZ ) are described and used to determine monthly pCO ( 2 ) anomaly . These are used in combination with monthly anomaly of sea surface temperature ( SST ) to investigate inter-annual variation of SST and pCO ( 2 ) . Monthly anomaly of SST ( a intense a 2 degree C ) are apparent in the CS , STZ and SAZ , and are indicative of strong inter-annual variability that seems to be related to large-scale coupled atmosphere-ocean oscillation . Anomalies of pCO ( 2 ) normalized to a constant temperature are negatively related to SST anomaly . A reduced winter-time vertical input of dissolved inorganic carbon ( DIC ) during phase of positive SST anomaly , related to a poleward shift of westerly wind , and a concomitant local decrease in wind stress is the likely cause of the negative relationship between pCO ( 2 ) and SST anomaly . The observed pattern is an increase of the sink for atmospheric CO2 associated with positive SST anomaly , although strongly modulated by inter-annual variability of wind speed . Assuming that phase of positive SST anomaly are indicative of the future evolution of regional ocean biogeochemistry under global warming , we show using a purely observational based approach that some province of the Southern Ocean could provide a potential negative feedback on increasing atmospheric CO2 .

aVClimatology and interannual variation of wintertime extratropical cyclone frequency in CCSM3 twentieth century simulation are compared with the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis during 1950-1999 . CCSM3 can simulate the storm track reasonably well , although the model produce slightly le cyclone at the beginning of the Pacific and Atlantic storm track and weaker poleward deflection over the Pacific . As in the reanalysis , frequency of cyclone stronger than 980 hPa show significant correlation with the Pacific/North America ( PNA ) teleconnection pattern over the Pacific region and with the North Atlantic Oscillation ( NAO ) in the Atlantic sector . Composite map are constructed for opposite phase of El Nino-Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) and the NAO and all anomalous pattern coincide with observed . One CCSM3 twenty-first century A1B scenario realization indicates there is significant increase in the extratropical cyclone frequency on the US west coast and decrease in Alaska . Meanwhile , cyclone frequency increase from the Great Lakes region to Quebec and decrease over the US east coast , suggesting a possible northward shift of the Atlantic storm track under the warmer climate . The cyclone frequency anomaly are closely linked to change in seasonal mean state of the upper-troposphere zonal wind and baroclinicity in the lower troposphere . Due to lack of 6-hourly output , we can not apply the cyclone-tracking algorithm to the other eight CCSM3 realization . Based on the linkage between the mean state change and the cyclone frequency anomaly , it is likely a common feature among the other ensemble member that cyclone activity is reduced on the East Coast and in Alaska a a result of global warming .

aVThe common cord-grass Spartina anglica , a fertile hybrid of S. maritima and S. alterniflora , wa planted in the European Wadden Sea extensively during the late 1920s and 1930s to promote sediment accretion . After establishment , it colonised a a pioneer plant in the upper tidal zone , where it occurs frequently in coherent sward at the seaward front of saltmarshes and in patch on the tidal flat . Often , a conspicuous , almost monotypic , belt of S. anglica is formed . Over the last two decade , an increase in abundance and accelerated spread of S. anglica wa observed , possibly promoted by warmer spring temperature . This alien specie may benefit from global warming , and there is considerable concern about it harmful impact on the native biocoenoses and native biodiversity of the unique Wadden Sea ecosystem , encompassing effect on hydromorphodynamics and coastal protection . For a definitive assessment , however , an adequate quantification and comparison of documented and potential effect of S. anglica is important , but currently unavailable . Consequently , no management strategy exists for the prevention or restoration of the Wadden Sea ecosystem . Thus , the development of an alien specie plan on the level of the Trilateral Cooperation on the Protection of the Wadden Sea is essential .

aVOur research ha investigated the use of CF3I , which ha lower Global Warming Potential ( GWP ) , a a substitute gas for SF6 . The use of pure CF3I in gas insulated switchgear ( GIS ) and gas circuit breaker ( GCB ) is difficult because liquid CF3I ha a high boiling point . We have therefore mixed CF3I with CO2 or N-2 . By investigating the decomposed gas after a current interruption , we have shown that the iodine density from CF31-CO2 ( 30 % -70 % ) is about 1/3 of that of pure CF3I . In addition , no fluorine wa detected from the gas mixture . Our investigation of the breakdown voltage characteristic ha shown that the dielectric strength of CF3I-CO2 ( 30 % -70 % ) is about 0.75 to 0.80 time that of SF6 . In Breaker Terminal Fault ( BTF ) and Short Line Fault ( SLF ) interruption , CF3I-CO2 is superior to CF3I-N-2 . Because of the high boiling point of CF3I , the proportion of CF3I should be small . In BTF interruption , the performance approximates to that of pure CF3I when the proportion of CF3I exceeds 30 % . Similarly , the SLF interruption performance approximates to that of pure CF3I when the proportion of CF3I exceeds 20 % .

aVThe loggerhead sea turtle is an endangered specie exposed to many anthropogenic hazard in the Pacific . It is widely held that pelagic longline fishery pose the major risk for Pacific loggerhead but the effect of other risk factor such a human-induced global climate change have rarely been considered . So we used generalised additive regression modelling and autoregressive-prewhitened cross-correlation analysis to explore whether regional ocean temperature affect the long-term nesting population dynamic for the 2 Pacific loggerhead genetic stock ( Japan , Australia ) . We found that both Pacific stock have been exposed to slowly increasing trend in mean annual sea surface temperature in their respective core regional foraging habitat over the past 50 year . We show that irrespective of whether a population wa decreasing or increasing that there wa an inverse correlation between nesting abundance and mean annual sea surface temperature in the core foraging region during the year prior to the summer nesting season . Cooler foraging habitat ocean temperature are presumably associated with increased ocean productivity and prey abundance and consequently increased loggerhead breeding capacity . So warming regional ocean temperature could lead to long-term decreased food supply and reduced nesting and recruitment unless Pacific loggerhead adapt by shifting their foraging habitat to cooler region . So the gradual warming of the Pacific Ocean over the past 50 year is a major risk factor that must be considered in any meaningful diagnosis of the long-term decline apparent for some Pacific loggerhead nesting population .

aVGlobal climate change is expected to result in a greater frequency of extreme weather , which can cause lag effect on aboveground net primary production ( ANPP ) . However , our understanding of lag effect is limited . To explore lag effect following extreme weather , we applied four treatment ( control , doubled precipitation , 4 degree C warming , and warming plus doubled precipitation ) for 1 year in a randomized block design and monitored change in ecosystem process for 3 year in an old-field tallgrass prairie in central Oklahoma . Biomass wa estimated twice in the pretreatment year , and three time during the treatment and posttreatment year . Total plant biomass wa increased by warming in spring of the treatment year and by doubled precipitation in summer . However , double precipitation suppressed fall production . During the following spring , biomass production wa significantly suppressed in the formerly warmed plot 2 month after treatment ceased . Nine month after the end of treatment , fall production remained suppressed in double precipitation and warming plus double precipitation treatment . Also , the formerly warmed plot still had a significantly greater proportion of C ( 4 ) plant , while the warmed plus double precipitation plot retained a high proportion of C ( 3 ) plant . The lag effect of warming on biomass did not match the temporal pattern of soil nitrogen availability determined by plant root simulator probe , but coincided with warming-induced decrease in available soil moisture in the deepest layer of soil which recovered to the pretreatment pattern approximately 10 month after the treatment ceased . Analyzing the data with an ecosystem model showed that the lagged temporal pattern of effect of warming and precipitation on biomass can be fully explained by warming-induced difference in soil moisture . Thus , both the experimental result and modeling analysis indicate that water availability regulates lag effect of warming on biomass production .

aVDamage caused by excess water can be Occurred about 1.8 million hectare , from which 60 % , is located in the arable-land in Hungary . Because of global climate change the frequency of excess water inundation related to land use risk may be higher in the near future . The investigated area wa the Bekes-Csanad Loess Plateau . In Our study we examined the relation between saturated buffer zone of excess water inundation and land use risk based on CLC50 database . The highest land use risk value were found on those area which used for extensive agricultural production . Accordingly there is a need for an adequate field specified sustainable agricultural production which can take into consideration the actual risk of excess water inundation with different saturated zone . The result assisted and enabled the land use planning of the inundated and saturated area by excess water , it well it it could be used for the calculation of different water management and land use scenario .

aVThe recent quest to replace fossil fuel with renewable and sustainable energy source ha increased interest on utilization of landfill and bio gas . It is further augmented due to environment concern and global warming caused by burning of conventional fossil fuel , energy security concern and high cost of crude oil , and renewable nature of these gas . The main portion of landfill gas or biogas is comprised of methane and carbon dioxide with some other gas in small proportion . Methane if released directly to the atmosphere cause about 21 time global warming effect than carbon dioxide . Thus landfill gas is generally flared , where the energy recovery is not in place in practice . Using landfill gas to generate energy not only encourages more efficient collection reducing emission into the atmosphere but also generates revenue for operator and local government . However , use of landfill gas for energy production is not always perceived a an attractive option because of some disadvantage . Thus it becomes necessary to address these disadvantage involved by studying landfill gas in a technological perspective and motivate utilization of landfill gas for future energy need . This paper discussed landfill gas a a fuel for a spark ignition engine to produce power in an effective way . It ha been shown that though the performance and combustion characteristic of the landfill gas fueled engine deteriorated in comparison with methane operation , increasing compression ratio and advancing spark timing improved the performance of the landfill gas operation in par with methane operation . The effect due to composition change in the landfill gas were found more pronounced at lean and rich mixture operation than at stoichiometry . In addition , the effect of addition of hydrogen up to 30 % in the landfill gas were studied . Addition of even small quantity of hydrogen such a 3-5 % delivered better performance improvement particularly at the lean and rich limit operation and extended the operational limit . Additions of hydrogen also improved the combustion characteristic and reduced cyclic variation of landfill gas operation especially at the lean and rich mixture . ( C ) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

aVBackground , aim and scope The environmental aspect of company and their product are becoming more significant in delivering competitive advantage . Formway Furniture , a designer and manufacturer of office furniture product , is a New Zealand-based company that is committed to sustainable development . It manufacture two model of the light , intuitive , flexible and environmental ( LIFE ) office chair : one with an aluminium base and one with a glass-filled nylon ( GFN ) base . It wa decided to undertake a life cycle assessment ( LCA ) study of these two model in order to : ( 1 ) determine environmental hotspot in the life cycle of the two chair ( goal 1 ) ; ( 2 ) compare the life cycle impact of the two chair ( goal 2 ) ; and ( 3 ) compare alternative potential waste-management scenario ( goal 3 ) . The study also included sensitivity analysis with respect to recycled content of aluminium in the product . Materials and method The LIFE chair model consist of a mix of metal and plastic component manufactured by selected Formway supplier according to design criterion . Hence , the research methodology included determining the specific material composition of the two chair model and acquisition of manufacturing data from individual supplier . These data were compiled and used in conjunction with pre-existing data , specifically from the ecoinvent database purchased in conjunction with the SimaPro7 LCA software , to develop the life cycle inventory of the two chair model . The life cycle stage included in the study extended from raw-material extraction through to waste management . Impact assessment wa carried out using CML 2 baseline 2000 , the methodology developed by Leiden University 's Institute for Environmental Sciences . Results This paper present result for global warming potential ( GWP100 ) . The study showed a significant impact contribution from the raw-material extraction/refinement stage for both chair model ; aluminium extraction and refining made the greatest contribution to GWP100 . The comparison of the two LIFE chair model showed that the model with the aluminium base had a higher GWP100 impact than the model with the GFN base . The waste-management scenario compared the GWP100 result when ( 1 ) both chair model were sent to landfill and ( 2 ) steel and aluminium component were recycled with the remainder of the chair sent to landfill . The result showed that the recycling scenario contributed to a reduced GWP100 result . Since production and processing of aluminium wa found to be significant , a sensitivity analysis wa carried out to determine the impact of using aluminium with different recycled content ( 0 % , 34 % and 100 % ) in both waste-management scenario ; this showed that increased use of recycled aluminium wa beneficial . The recycling at end-of-life scenario wa modelled using two different end-of-life allocation approach , i.e . consequential and attributional , in order to illustrate the variation in result caused by choice of allocation approach . The result using the consequential approach showed that recycling at end-of-life wa beneficial , while use of the attributional method led to a similar GWP100 a that seen for the landfill scenario . Discussion The result show that the main hotspot in the life cycle is the raw-material extraction/refinement stage . This can be attributed to the extraction and processing of aluminium , a material that is energy intensive . The LIFE chair model with the aluminium base ha a higher GWP100 a it contains more aluminium . Sensitivity analysis pertaining to the recycled content of aluminium showed that use of aluminium with high recycled content wa beneficial ; this is because production of recycled aluminium is le energy intensive than production of primary aluminium . The waste-management scenario showed that recycling at end-of-life resulted in a significantly lower GWP100 than landfilling at end-of-life . However , this result is dependent upon the modelling approach used for recycling . Conclusions With respect to goal 1 , the study found that the raw-material extraction/refinement stage of the life cycle wa a significant factor for both LIFE chair model . This wa largely due to the use of aluminium in the product . For goal 2 , it wa found that the LIFE chair model with the aluminium base had a higher GWP100 than the GFN model , again due to the material content of the two model . Results for goal 3 illustrated that recycling at end-of-life is beneficial when using a system expansion ( consequential ) approach to model recycling ; if an attributional 'cut-off ' approach is used to model recycling at end-of-life , there is virtually no difference in the result between landfilling and recycling . Sensitivity analysis pertaining to the recycled content of aluminium showed that use of higher recycled content lead to a lower GWP100 impact . Recommendation and perspective Most of the GWP100 impact wa contributed during the raw-material extraction/refinement stage of the life cycle ; thus , the overall impact of both LIFE chair model may be reduced through engaging in material choice and supply chain environmental management with respect to environmental requirement . The study identified aluminium component a a major contributor to GWP100 for both LIFE chair model and also highlighted the sensitivity of the result to it recycled content . Thus , it is recommended that the use of aluminium in future product design be limited unless it is possible to use aluminium with a high recycled content . With respect to waste management , it wa found that a substantial reduction in the GWP100 impact would occur if the chair are recycled rather than landfilled , assuming an expanding market for aluminium . Thus , recycling the two LIFE chair model at end-of-life is highly recommended .

aVProduction of milk cause environmental side effect , such a emission of greenhouse gas and nutrient enrichment in surface water . Scientific evidence that show difference in integral environmental impact between milk production system in the Netherlands wa underexposed . In this paper , two Dutch milk production system , i.e . a conventional and an organic , were compared on their integral environmental impact and hotspot were identified in the conventional and organic milk production chain . Identification of a hotspot provides insight into mitigation option for conventional and organic milk production . Data of commercial farm that participated in two pilot-studies were used and refer to the year 2003 . For each farm , a detailed cradle-to-farm-gate life cycle assessment , including on and off farm pollution wa performed . Results showed better environmental performance concerning energy use and eutrophication potential per kilogram of milk for organic farm than for conventional farm . Furthermore , higher on-farm acidification potential and global warming potential per kilogram organic milk implies that higher ammonia , methane , and nitrous oxide emission occur on farm per kilogram organic milk than for conventional milk . Total acidification potential and global warming potential per kilogram milk did not differ between the selected conventional and organic farm . In addition , result showed lower land use per kilogram conventional milk compared with organic milk . In the selected conventional farm , purchased concentrate wa found to be the hotspot in off farm and total impact for all impact category , whereas in the selected organic farm , both purchased concentrate and roughage were found to be the hotspot in off farm impact . We recommend to improve integral environmental performance of milk production by : ( 1 ) reducing the use of concentrate ingredient with a high environmental impact , ( 2 ) decreasing the use of concentrate per kilogram of milk , and ( 3 ) reducing nutrient surplus by improving farm nutrient flow .

aVThe objective of the analysis reported in this paper are to evaluate the environmental impact of the electricity produced in a 17 MW solar thermal plant with central tower technology and a 50 MW solar thermal plant with parabolic trough technology , to identify the opportunity to improve the system in order to reduce their environmental impact , and to evaluate the environmental impact resulting from compliance with the solar thermal power objective in Spain . The methodology chosen is the life cycle assessment ( LCA ) , described in the international standard series ISO 14040-43 . The functional unit ha been defined a the production of 1 kW h of electricity . Energy use needed to construct , operate , and dismantle the power plant is estimated . These result are used to calculate the `` energy payback time '' of these technology . Results were around 1. yr for both power plant . Environmental impact analyzed include the global warming impact along the whole life cycle of the power plant , which were around 200 g/kW h generated . Finally , the environmental impact associated with the compliance of the solar thermal power objective in Spain were computed . Those figure were then used to estimate the avoided environmental impact including the potential CO ( 2 ) emission saving that could be accomplished by these promotion policy . These saving amounted for 634 kt Of CO ( 2 ) equiv./yr .

aVLife-history trade-off allow many animal to maintain reproductive fitness across a range of climatic condition . When used by parasite and pathogen , these strategy may influence pattern of disease in changing climate . The chytrid fungus , Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis , is linked to global decline of amphibian population . Short-term growth in culture is maximal at 17 degrees-25 degree C. This ha been used in an argument that global warming , which increase the time that amphibian spend at these temperature in cloud-covered montane environment , ha led to extinction . Here we show that the amphibian chytrid responds to decreasing temperature with trade-off that increase fecundity a maturation rate slows and increase infectivity a growth decrease . At 17 degrees-25 degree C , infectious zoospore encyst ( settle and develop a cell wall ) and develop into the zoospore-producing stage ( zoosporangium ) faster , while at 7 degrees-10 degree C , greater number of zoospore are produced per zoosporangium ; these remain infectious for a longer period of time . We modeled the population growth of B. dendrobatidis through time at various temperature using delayed differential equation and observational data for four parameter : developmental rate of thallus , fecundity , rate of zoospore encystment , and rate of zoospore survival . From the model , it is clear that life-history trade-off allow B. dendrobatidis to maintain a relatively high long-term growth rate at low temperature , so that it maintains high fitness across a range of temperature . When a seven-day cold shock is simulated , the outcome is intermediate between the two constant temperature regime , and in culture , a sudden drop in temperature induces zoospore release . These trade-off can be ecologically important for a variety of organism with complex life history , including pathogenic microorganism . The effect of temperature on amphibian mortality will depend on the interaction between fungal growth and host immune function and will be modified by host ecology , behavior , and life history . These result demonstrate that B. dendrobatidis population can grow at high rate across a broad range of environmental temperature and help to explain why it is so successful in cold montane environment .

aVKnowledge of local adaptation and adaptive potential of natural population is becoming increasingly relevant due to anthropogenic change in the environment , such a climate change . The concern is that population will be negatively affected by increasing temperature without the capacity to adapt . Temperature-related adaptability in trait related to phenology and early life history are expected to be particularly important in salmonid fish . We focused on the latter and investigated whether four population of brown trout ( Salmo trutta ) are locally adapted in early life-history trait . These population spawn in river that experience different temperature condition during the time of incubation of egg and embryo . They were reared in a common-garden experiment at three different temperature . Quantitative genetic differentiation ( Q ( ST ) ) exceeded neutral molecular differentiation ( F ( ST ) ) for two trait , indicating local adaptation . A temperature effect wa observed for three trait . However , this effect varied among population due to locally adapted reaction norm , corresponding to the temperature regime experienced by the population in their native environment . Additive genetic variance and heritable variation in phenotypic plasticity suggest that although increasing temperature are likely to affect some population negatively , they may have the potential to adapt to changing temperature regime .

aVIn contrast to the northern hemisphere where specie of Chironomidae are usually the dominant benthic invertebrate in the coldest upper reach of glacial stream , mayfly ( Deleatidium spp . : Leptophlebiidae ) predominate in equivalent condition in New Zealand . We examined the life history and annual production of Deleatidium spp . at two site on the Matukituki River ( South Island , New Zealand ) and at three site in it glacier-fed tributary , Rob Roy Stream . Mean annual water temperature at the five site ranged from 2.1 to 7.0 degree C. Monthly sampling showed that mayfly population were poorly synchronised at all site but were probably univoltine . The large Deleatidium cornutum wa the dominant mayfly specie found at the upper site ( Sites 1 and 2 ) on Rob Roy Stream , whereas above the confluence with Matukituki River ( Site 3 ) it co-existed with a complex of smaller specie we refer to a D. `` angustum '' . Deleatidium `` angustum '' also dominated at the Matukituki site . Deleatidium production calculated for the five site , assuming an 11-month nymphal life , ranged from 0.48 g dry weight/m ( 2 ) /year ( Site 1 ) to 3.07 g dry weight/m ( 2 ) /year ( Site 3 ) . The value for D. cornutum at Sites 2 and 3 are high for a specie of Deleatidium and reflect it large size . This specie appears to be strongly adapted for growth at low temperature . Climate change scenario for New Zealand predict the gradual and ultimate loss of small South Island glacier and a consequent warming of stream a runoff from rainfall and snow melt becomes more dominant in spring . As a result , suitable habitat will be lost for cold-water specialist such a D. cornutum , and they are likely to suffer reduction in their distributional range and local extinction . In contrast , specie such a those in the D. `` angustum '' complex may extend their range into stream formerly dominated by glacial meltwater .

aVMediterranean Sea ecosystem are experiencing a phase of major modification owing to the fast increase in several disturbance such a pollution , eutrophication , habitat destruction , over-fishing , income of alien specie , and climate change . One of the main problem in recent year is that global warming seems to intensify the effect of all the above-mentioned disturbance , dramatically reducing the biodiversity of the basin . The ever more frequent mass mortality that are affecting shallow coastal environment are rapidly reducing the biomass of several filter feeder and both sponge and gorgonian are the most endangered taxon . In this paper we review the most recent episode of mass mortality , mainly involving sea fan , and discus the possible effect that the loss of these organism can have on benthic assemblage structure . The data presented here are referred mainly to the study case of the MPA of Portofino ( Ligurian Sea , Italy ) .

aVThe last deglaciation is characterized by massive ice sheet melting , which result in an average sea-level rise of similar to 120-140 m. At least three major Melt-Water-Pulse ( MWP ) event ( 19ka-MWP , MWP-1A and MWP-1B ) are recognizable for the last deglaciation , of which MWP-1A event lasting from similar to 14.2 to similar to 13.7 ka B.P . is of the most significance . However , the accurate timing and source of MWP-1A event remain debatable and controversial . It ha long been postulated that meltwater of the last deglaciation pouring into the North Atlantic resulted in a slowdown or even a shutdown of the thermohaline circulation ( THC ) which subsequently affected the global climate change . Accordingly , the focus of this debate consists in establishing a reasonable relationship between MWP event and abrupt climate change . Here we summarize a variety of geological and model result for the last deglaciation , reaching a conclusion that the major MWP event did not correspond with the rigorous stadials , nor always happened within climate reversal interval . MWP event of the last deglaciation had very weak influence on the intensity of the THC and were not able to trigger a collapse of the global climate . We need to reevaluate the influence of the temporal meltwater variability on the global climate system .

aVWe measured dissolved N ( 2 ) O , CH ( 4 ) , O ( 2 ) , NH ( 4 ) ( + ) , NO ( 3 ) ( - ) and NO ( 2 ) ( - ) on 7 transects along the polluted Adyar River-estuary , SE India and estimated N ( 2 ) O and CH ( 4 ) emission using a gas exchange relation and a floating chamber . High NO ( 2 ) ( - ) implied some nitrification of a large anthropogenic NH ( 4 ) ( + ) pool . In the lower catchment CH ( 4 ) wa maximal ( 6.3+/-4.3 x 10 ( 4 ) nM ) , exceeding the ebullition threshold , whereas strong undersaturation of N ( 2 ) O and O ( 2 ) implied intense denitrification . Emissions flux for the whole Adyar system similar to 2.5 x 10 ( 8 ) g CH ( 4 ) yr ( -1 ) and similar to 2.4 x 10 ( 6 ) g N ( 2 ) O yr ( -1 ) estimated with a gas exchange relation and similar to 2 x 10 ( 9 ) g CH ( 4 ) yr ( -1 ) derived with a floating chamber illustrate the importance of CH ( 4 ) ebullition . An equivalent CO ( 2 ) flux similar to 1-10 x 10 ( 10 ) g yr ( -1 ) derived using global warming potential is equivalent to total Chennai motor vehicle CO ( 2 ) emission in one month . Studies such a this may inform More effective waste management and future compliance with international emission agreement . ( C ) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVAs ocean temperature increase , crustacean become subjected to more immediate , microecological impact because of their exothermically-driven growth and development . In this laboratory-based study , ovigerous American lobster ( Homarus americanus ) were allowed to incubate their egg for either a normal period of time ( 7-9 month including time at temperature 10 degree C to speedup the rate of egg development ( 4-6 month ) . Females that had shorter incubation time had longer period of larval release compared with female that incubated egg for a normal period of time . Females incubating egg for a shorter period of time also produced more larva , and this wa explained by the daily loss of a small number of egg . Subsequent modeling of the relationship between date of egg extrusion and hatching using data compiled from Massachusetts Bay demonstrated that there wa a critical period in the fall at which larval development would switch from a resultant hatch in the spring to a hatch in the late fall or winter . The short-term implication of global warming on egg development and hatching in lobster is discussed , including the production of larva at suboptimal time of the year , a well a a temporal change in the abundance of larva during the hatching season . Either of these event can lead to an increase in larval mortality and hence a decrease in population productivity .

aVThe paper describes the model software REPRO ( REPROduction of soil fertility ) designed for analyzing interlinked carbon ( C ) and nitrogen ( N ) flux in the system soil-plant-animal-environment . The model couple the balancing of C , N and energy flux with the target to estimate the climate-relevant CO ( 2 ) , CH ( 4 ) and N ( 2 ) O source and sink of fanning system . For the determination of the net greenhouse effect , calculation of C sequestration in the Soil , CO ( 2 ) emission from the use of fossil energy , CH ( 4 ) emission from livestock keeping and N ( 2 ) O emission from the soil have been made . The result were converted into CO ( 2 ) equivalent using it specific global warming potential ( GWP ) . The model ha been applied in the experimental farm Scheyem in southern Germany , which had been divided into an organic ( org ) and a conventional ( con ) farming system in 1992 . Rather detailed series of long-term measuring data are available for the farm in Scheyern , which have been used for validating the software for it efficiency and applicability under very different management yet nearly equal site condition . The organic farm is multi-structured with a legume-based crop rotation ( N ( 2 ) fixation : 83 kg ha ( -1 ) yr ( -1 ) ) . The livestock density ( LSU =Livestock Unit according to FAO ) is 1.4 LSU ha ( -1 ) . The farm is oriented on closed mass cycle ; from the energetic point of view it represents a low-input system ( energy input 4.5 GJ ha ( -1 ) yr ( -1 ) ) . The conventional farm is a simple-structured cash crop system , based on mineral N ( N input 145 kg ha ( -1 ) yr ( -1 ) ) . Regarding the energy consumption , the system is run on high input ( energy input 14.0 GJ ha ( -1 ) yr ( -1 ) ) . The organic crop rotation reach about 57 % ( 8.3 Mg ha ( -1 ) yr ( -1 ) ) of the DM yield , about 66 % ( 163 kg ha ( -1 ) yr ( -1 ) ) of the N removal and roughly 56 % ( 3741 kg ha ( -1 ) yr ( -1 ) ) of the C fixation of the conventional crop rotation . In the organic rotation , 18 GJ per GJ of fossil energy input are bound in the harvested biomass vis-a-vis 11.1 GJ in the conventional rotation . The strongest influence on the greenhouse effect is exerted by C sequestration and N ( 2 ) O emission . In Scheyern , C sequestration ha set in under organic management ( +0.37 Mg ha ( -1 ) yr ( -1 ) ) , while humus depletion ha been recorded in the conventional system ( -0.25 Mg ha ( -1 ) yr ( -1 ) ) . Greenhouse gas emission ( GGEs ) due to fuel consumption and the use of machine are nearly on the same level in both crop rotation . However , the conventional system emits an additional 637 kg CO ( 2 ) eq ha ( -1 ) yr ( -1 ) , which had been consumed in the manufacture of mineral N and pesticide in the upstream industry . Besides the analysis in the experimental farm Scheyern , the model ha been applied in 28 commercial farm ( 18 org and 10 con ) with comparable soil and climate condition in the surroundings of Scheyern ( mean distance 60 km ) . The program calculation are aimed at benchmarking the result obtained in the farming system Scheyern ; they are expected to disclose management-specific variation in the emission of climate-relevant gas and to rate the suitability of the model for describing such management-specific effect . In order to make the situation in the farm comparable , only the emission from cropping system were analyzed . Livestock keeping remained unconsidered . Due to lower N and energy input , clearly lower N ( 2 ) O and CO ( 2 ) emission were obtained for the organic farm than for the conventional system . The analysis have shown possibility for the optimization of management and the mitigation of GGE . Our finding underline that organic farming includes a high potential for C sequestration and the reduction of GGEs . Currently , the model REPRO is tested by 90 farm in the Federal Republic of Germany with the aim to apply it in the future not only in the field of research but also in the management of commercial farm .

aVHow animal respond to perturbation of the environment is relevant to the effect of global climate change and human disturbance . The physiological mechanism underlying facultative response to unpredictable perturbation of the environment will allow u to understand why some population are able to cope more than others . This is important for basic biology a well a for conservation . Northern population of White-crowned Sparrow ( Zonotrichia leucophrys ) , show varying degree of modulation of the adrenocortical response to acute stress early in the breeding season . These variation are related to a short breeding season at high latitude and altitude ( up-regulation of the stress response ) , and possibly degree of parental care ( down-regulation of the stress response ) . Investigations of many taxon from the northern hemisphere indicate these type of modulation are widespread among vertebrate . However , modulation of the adrenocortical response to stress is much le well-known in the southern hemisphere and Neotropical bird present an ideal model system to test whether pattern of hormonal response to stress in the northern hemisphere are consistent worldwide . Equatorial , high altitude , population of the Rufous-collared Sparrow ( Z. capensis costaricensis ) , a southern congener of the White-crowned Sparrow , have long breeding season , but show no early breeding up-regulation of the adrenocortical response to stress . This pattern is more similar to mid-latitude , low altitude , population of White-crowned Sparrows ; Whether austral high latitude and altitude population of the Rufous-collared Sparrows modulate these process , under presumably similar constraint of mid- to high latitude seasonality in the north , is currently under investigation .

aVRelatively brief period of severe paleoenvironmental change during the Jurassic and Cretaceous were associated with the widespread accumulation of organic-rich marine deposit , termed oceanic anoxic event ( OAEs ) . These interval involved abrupt global warming of similar to 5-10 degree C , higher rate of continental weathering , elevated extinction rate , and large-scale perturbation to the global carbon cycle . The major OAEs also overlapped temporally the emplacement of large igneous province . However , despite being known a OAEs , the extent of seawater anoxia at those time is undefined and the causative process remain unclear . Here we show how change in seawater molybdenum isotope ratio ( a proxy for seawater anoxia ) during the Toarcian ( Early Jurassic ) OAE define the onset and expansion of oxygen deficient condition . Our data also place constraint on the areal extent of marine anoxia during the event and demonstrate that anoxia expanded and contracted periodically , broadly in line with precession-driven change in delta C-13 ( org ) . Despite their intermittent occurrence over geological history , OAEs have an important contemporary relevance because the magnitude and high rate of environmental change then were broadly similar to those occurring at the present day .

aVThe monitoring and analysis of the process taking place in an ecosystem is a key issue for a sustainable human activity . A system Of Populations , a the biotic component of a complex ecosystem is usually affected by the variation of it abiotic environment . Even in nearly natural ecosystem an abiotic effect like climatic implication of global warming may cause important change in the dynamic of the population system . In ecosystem involving field cultivation or any industrial activity ; the abiotic parameter in question may be the concentration of a Substance , changing , e.g . a a result of pollution , application of a pesticide , or a fertilizer , etc . In many case the observation of the density of each population may be technically complicated or expensive , therefore the question arises whether from the observation of the density of certain ( indicator ) population , the whole state process of the population system can be uniquely recovered . The paper is aimed at a methodological development of the state monitoring , under the condition of a changing environment . It is shown , how the technique of mathematical system theory can be applied not only for the approximate calculation of the state process on the basis of the observed data , even under the effect of an exogene abiotic change with known dynamic ; but in certain case , also for the estimation of the unknown biological effect of the change of an abiotic parameter . The proposed methodology is applied to simple illustrative example concerning a three-species predator-prey system . ( c ) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All right reserved .

aVA typical question in climate change analysis is whether a certain observed climate characteristic , like a pronounced anomaly or an interdecadal trend , is an indicator of anthropogenic climate change or still in the range of natural variability . Many climatic feature are described by one-dimensional index time series , like for instance the global mean temperature or circulation index . Here , we present a Bayesian classification approach applied to the time series of the northern annular mode ( NAM ) , which is the leading mode of Northern Hemisphere climate variability . After a pronounced negative phase during the 1950s and 1960s , the observed NAM index reveals a distinct positive trend , which is also simulated by various climate model simulation under enhanced greenhouse condition . The objective of this study is to decide whether the observed temporal evolution of the NAM may be an indicator of global warming . Given a set of prior probability for disturbed and undisturbed climate scenario , the Bayesian decision theorem decides whether the observed NAM trend is classified in a control climate , a greenhouse-gas plus sulphate aerosol climate or a purely greenhouse-gas induced climate a derived from multi-model ensemble simulation . The three climate scenario are well separated from each other in term of the 30-year NAM trend . The multi-model ensemble contain a weak but statistically significant climate change signal in the form of an intensification of the NAM . The Bayesian classification suggests that the greenhouse-gas scenario is the most probable explanation for the observed NAM trend since 1960 , even if a high prior probability is assigned to the control climate . However , there are still large uncertainty in this classification result because some period at the end of the 19th century and during the `` warm '' 1920s are also classified in an anthropogenic climate , although natural forcings are likely responsible for this early NAM intensification . This demonstrates a basic shortcoming of the Bayesian decision theorem when it is based on one-dimensional index time series like the NAM index . ( c ) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All right reserved .

aVThe relationship , on a global basis , between the amount of N fixed by chemical , biological or atmospheric process entering the terrestrial biosphere , and the total emission of nitrous oxide ( N2O ) , ha been re-examined , using known global atmospheric removal rate and concentration growth of N2O a a proxy for overall emission . For both the pre-industrial period and in recent time , after taking into account the large-scale change in synthetic N fertiliser production , we find an overall conversion factor of 3-5 % from newly fixed N to N2O-N. We assume the same factor to be valid for biofuel production system . It is covered only in part by the default conversion factor for `` direct '' emission from agricultural crop land ( 1 % ) estimated by IPCC ( 2006 ) , and the default factor for the `` indirect '' emission ( following volatilization/deposition and leaching/runoff of N : 0.35-0.45 % ) cited therein . However , a we show in the paper , when additional emission included in the IPCC methodology , e.g . those from livestock production , are included , the total may not be inconsistent with that given by our `` top-down '' method . When the extra N2O emission from biofuel production is calculated in `` CO2-equivalent '' global warming term , and compared with the quasi-cooling effect of `` saving '' emission of fossil fuel derived CO2 , the outcome is that the production of commonly used biofuels , such a biodiesel from rapeseed and bioethanol from corn ( maize ) , depending on N fertilizer uptake efficiency by the plant , can contribute a much or more to global warming by N2O emission than cooling by fossil fuel saving . Crops with le N demand , such a grass and woody coppice specie , have more favourable climate impact . This analysis only considers the conversion of biomass to biofuel . It doe not take into account the use of fossil fuel on the farm and for fertilizer and pesticide production , but it also neglect the production of useful co-products . Both factor partially compensate each other . This need to be analyzed in a full life cycle assessment .

aV[ 1 ] Nitrogen trifluoride ( NF ( 3 ) ) can be called the missing greenhouse gas : It is a synthetic chemical produced in industrial quantity ; it is not included in the Kyoto basket of greenhouse gas or in national reporting under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) ; and there are no observation documenting it atmospheric abundance . Current publication report a long lifetime of 740 yr and a global warming potential ( GWP ) , which in the Kyoto basket is second only to SF ( 6 ) . We re-examine the atmospheric chemistry of NF ( 3 ) and calculate a shorter lifetime of 550 yr , but still far beyond any societal time frame . With 2008 production equivalent to 67 million metric ton of CO ( 2 ) , NF ( 3 ) ha a potential greenhouse impact larger than that of the industrialized nation ' emission of PFCs or SF ( 6 ) , or even that of the world 's largest coal-fired power plant . If released , annual production would increase the lower atmospheric abundance by 0.4 ppt , and it is urgent to document NF ( 3 ) emission through atmospheric observation .

aVChina ha long been the world 's most populous nation and faced the double challenge of ensuring it food security without causing catastrophic damage to the environment . Since the early 1960s , Chinese agricultural development ha been premised on large domestic increase in nitrogen ( N ) fertilizer production and consumption . However , current utilization of fertilizer is far beyond optimum , with the fate of excess N largely unknown . Here , we report on N flow , loss , and use efficiency in the production and utilization of three major grain crop using data from 2004 . We also use a scenario analysis to explore strategy for improving N use efficiency . Our calculation show that N use efficiency in food production and utilization is much lower than previously published estimate . Mean N surplus of crop field were 144 kg/ha for wheat , 184 kg/ha for rice , and 120 kg/ha for maize . We estimate that between 50 % and 85 % of N harvested a grain is lost for utilization by human and animal . Fertilizer N use efficiency ( FNUE ) value in crop-animal system for wheat , rice , and maize were 13.4 % , 11.3 % , and 3.7 % , respectively . This mean 7.5 , 8.9 and 27.1 kg of N fertilizer were required to produce I kg of N in food via fertilization for these three grain . Major room exists for improving the efficiency of N flow in Chinese crop system . Our scenario analysis show that increase in N use efficiency of fertilizer applied to cropland ( RE ) , decreasing ratio of grain N headed to plant food processing ( GLIP ) , and increasing efficiency in animal production ( ANU ) would result in a marked decrease in N loss from these three crop amounting to one million ton of N , which accounted for 6 % of total chemical fertilizer input . Improved N management in Chinese food production ha major ramification for global estimation of N use efficiency and environmental pollution by reactive N , particularly nitrous oxide emission , a major anthropogenic contributor to global climate change .

aVThe South Asian river show a discharge weighted average NO ( 3 ) -N of 2 mg/l and average sediment-bound N , that is mostly organic , of 0.2 % . The reported global average for the uncontaminated river system is of the order of about 0.028 mg/l ( NO ( 3 ) -N ) . Hence , our fresh-water aquatic system can no longer be considered natural , at least with respect to nitrogen transport . The average is still below the WHO limit of 100 1 mg/ NO ( 3 ) -N for drinking water , but there are extreme variation in different river ( Ganges , Krishna , etc . ) and at different location ( Cauvery at Tiruchirapalli 29 mg/l , Ganges at Patna , 140 mg/l , etc. ) . Sediment-bound N is generally le than 1 % , but value a high a about 3 % have been reported for some river indicating rapid transfer of soil organic matter to river a particulate organic nitrogen . While the nitrogen . story for various groundwater region is well understood a representing fertilizer run-off , the riverine N is yet to be studied in detail ; the link between river process and global climate change would warrant urgent study of the river system of South Asia that carry an annual . water flux of about 2100 km ( 3 ) ( about 6 % of global run-off ) and an annual sediment flux or over one billion ton ( about 10 % of global flux ) . Rough calculation of available data indicate that the total N flux from river to ocean in South Asia is likely to be several factor higher than that indicated by some representative contaminated river of the world .

aVCarbon is an essential component of life and , in it organic form , play a pivotal role in the soil 's fertility , productivity , and water retention . It is an integral part of the atmospheric-terrestrial C exchange cycle mediated via photosynthesis ; furthermore , it emerged recently a a new trading commodity , i.e. , `` carbon credit . '' When carefully manipulated , C sequestration by the soil could balance and mitigate anthropogenic CO ( 2 ) emission into the atmosphere char are believed to contribute global warming . The pressing need for assessing the soil 's C stock at local , regional , and global scale , now in the forefront of much research , is considerably hindered by the problem besetting dry-combustion chemical analysis , even with state-of-the-art procedure . To overcome these issue , we developed a new method based on gamma-ray spectroscopy induced by inelastic neutron scattering ( INS ) . The INS method is all in situ , nondestructive , multielemental technique that can be used in stationary or continous-scanning mode of operation . The result from data acquired from all investigated soil mass of a few hundred kilogram to all approximate depth of 30 cm are reported immediately Our initial experiment have demonstrated the feasibility Of Our proposed approach ; we obtained a linear response with C concentration and a detection limit between 0.5 and 1 % C by weight .

aVDecadal fluctuation in salinity , nutrient , chlorophyll , a variety of zooplankton taxon , and fish stock in the Northeast Pacific are often poorly correlated with the most widely-used index of large- scale climate variability in the region - the Pacific Decadal Oscillation ( PDO ) . We define a new pattern of climate change , the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation ( NPGO ) and show that it variability is significantly correlated with previously unexplained fluctuation of salinity , nutrient and chlorophyll . Fluctuations in the NPGO are driven by regional and basin-scale variation in wind-driven upwelling and horizontal advection - the fundamental process controlling salinity and nutrient concentration . Nutrient fluctuation drive concomitant change in phytoplankton concentration , and may force similar variability in higher trophic level . The NPGO thus provides a strong indicator of fluctuation in the mechanism driving planktonic ecosystem dynamic . The NPGO pattern extends beyond the North Pacific and is part of a global-scale mode of climate variability that is evident in global sea level trend and sea surface temperature . Therefore the amplification of the NPGO variance found in observation and in global warming simulation implies that the NPGO may play an increasingly important role in forcing global-scale decadal change in marine ecosystem .

aVIn addition to the predicted rise in temperature , a recognised consequence of increased atmospheric CO2 is ocean acidification . The response of marine organism to the stress associated with acidification is still not understood , and a number of recent experiment have addressed this problem . The starting point for many of these study ha been the development of a system by which seawater pH can be altered and then maintained . The current paper present detail of a temperature- and pH-controlled microcosm system , which enables the establishment of a tidal regime , for the experimental investigation of intertidal organism . Two climate scenario were simulated to evaluate the system 's precision and accuracy ; Year 2008 ( 'low ' [ CO2 ] : 380 ppm and 14 degree C ) condition and Year 2100 ( 'high ' [ CO2 ] ) condition ( based on the IPCC-Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change-2007 A2 scenario , 'high ' [ CO2 ] : 1250 ppm and 2.0 to 5.4 degree C warming ) . The temperature and seawater carbonate chemistry were reliably maintained for 30 d during which time newly settled barnacle cyprids were allowed to metamorphose into juvenile , then grow and develop . The pH and [ CO2 ] had 95 % confidence interval of 0.03 unit and 17 ppm , respectively , under low [ CO2 ] condition , and of 0.02 unit and 43 ppm , respectively , under high [ CO2 ] condition . The tidal regime is fully adjustable , and on this occasion wa set to a 6 h cycle . These microcosm have proved ideal for studying benthic organism from a variety of near-surface environment and at different stage of their life-cycle .

aVPredicting global climate change is a great challenge and must be based on a thorough Understanding of how the climate system component behave . Precipitable water vapor ( PWV ) is one of the key component in determining and predicting the global climate system , It is well known that the local surface temperature and pressure have a direct influence on the production of PWV . However , the influence of solar activity on atmospheric dynamic and their physical mechanism is still all open debate , where past Studies are focused at mid-latitude region . A new method of determining and quantifying the solar influence PWV based on GPS observation to correlate the GPS PWV and total electron content TEC variation is proposed . Observed data from Scott Base ( SBA ) and McMurdo ( MCM ) station from 2003 to 2005 have been used to study the response of PWV to solar activity . In the analysis , the effect of local condition ( wind speed and relative humidity ) on the distribution of PWV are investigated . Results show significant correlation between PWV and solar activity for four geomagnetic storm , with correlation coefficient of 0.74 , 0.77 , 0.64 and 0.69 , which are all significant at the 95 % confidence level . There wa no significant correlation between TEC and PWV change during the absence of storm . On a monthly analysis , a strong relationship exists between PWV and TEC during storm-affected day , with correlation coefficient of 0.83 and 0.89 ( 99 % confidence level ) for SBA and MCM respectively . These indicate a statistically significant seasonal signal in the Antarctic region , which is very active ( higher ) during the summer and inactive ( lower ) for the winter period .

aVHigh quality observation of the atmosphere are particularly required for monitoring global climate change . Radio occultation ( RO ) data , using Global Navigation Satellite System ( GNSS ) signal , are well suited for this challenge . The special climate utility of RO data arises from their long-term stability due to their self-calibrated nature . The German research satellite CHAllenging Minisatellite Payload for geoscientific research ( CHAMP ) continuously record RO profile since August 2001 providing the first opportunity to create RO based climatology for a multi-year period of more than 5 year . A period of missing CHAMP data from July 3 , 2006 to August 8 , 2006 can be bridged with RO data from the GRACE satellite ( Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment ) . We have built seasonal and zonal mean climatology of atmospheric ( dry ) temperature , microwave refractivity , geopotential height and pressure with 10 degree latitudinal resolution . We show representative result with focus on dry temperature and compare them with analysis data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ( ECMWF ) . Although we have available only about 150 CHAMP profile per day ( compared to million of data entering the ECMWF analysis ) the overall agreement between 8 and 30 km altitude is in general very good with systematic difference < 0.5 K in most part of the domain . Pronounced systematic difference ( exceeding 2 K ) in the tropical tropopause region and above Antarctica in southern winter can almost entirely be attributed to error in the ECMWF analysis . Errors resulting from uneven sampling in space and time are a potential error source for single-satellite climatology . The average CHAMP sampling error for seasonal zonal mean is < 0.2 K , higher value occur in restricted region and time interval which can be clearly identified by the sampling error estimation approach we introduced ( which is based on ECMWF analysis field ) . The total error of this new type of temperature climatology is estimated to be < 0.5 K below 30 km . The recently launched Taiwan/U.S . FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC constellation of 6 RO satellite started to provide thousand of RO profile per day , but already now the single-satellite CHAMP RO climatology improve upon modern operational climatology in the upper troposphere-lower stratosphere and can act a absolute reference climatology for validation of more bias-sensitive climate datasets and model .

aVOcean acidification represents a key threat to coral reef by reducing the calcification rate of framework builder . In addition , acidification is likely to affect the relationship between coral and their symbiotic dinoflagellate and the productivity of this association . However , little is known about how acidification impact on the physiology of reef builder and how acidification interacts with warming . Here , we report on an 8-week study that compared bleaching , productivity , and calcification response of crustose coralline algae ( CCA ) and branching ( Acropora ) and massive ( Porites ) coral specie in response to acidification and warming . Using a 30-tank experimental system , we manipulated CO2 level to simulate doubling and three- to fourfold increase [ intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) projection category IV and VI ] relative to present-day level under cool and warm scenario . Results indicated that high CO2 is a bleaching agent for coral and CCA under high irradiance , acting synergistically with warming to lower thermal bleaching threshold . We propose that CO2 . induces bleaching via it impact on photoprotective mechanism of the photosystems . Overall , acidification impacted more strongly on bleaching and productivity than on calcification . Interestingly , the intermediate , warm CO2 scenario led to a 30 % increase in productivity in Acropora , whereas high CO2 lead to zero productivity in both coral . CCA were most sensitive to acidification , with high CO2 leading to negative productivity and high rate of net dissolution . Our finding suggest that sensitive reef-building specie such a CCA may be pushed beyond their threshold for growth and survival within the next few decade whereas coral will show delayed and mixed response .

aVThe development of technology for waste treatment , simultaneously with minimizing greenhouse gas emission , ha become a matter of great concern at global level . Biogas system can help in the fight against global warming by avoiding to escape methane from organic waste , into the atmosphere . Biogas technology is of great benefit to the end-users and the environment by energy , compost and nutrient recovery . Romania is a country with a huge biomass potential . Implementing of biogas technology could be a proper solution for waste treatment and producing of electricity from renewable energy source , a stipulated in EU and national legislation . This paper present an overview on the progress of biogas technology in Romania since 1980s and the main obstacle that have slow down the development of this technology in the context of the major political and economical change registered in Romanian industry after 1990 . There are mentioned the main benefit which biogas plant could bring to the environment and also some common problem with biogas plant which have been noticed in the developed country in this field .

aVThe effect of nonlinear decay and consumer preference are analyzed in a setting where optimal extraction of nonrenewable resource is combined with stock externality . The control is exercised via a corrective tax and the time horizon is divided into two period : an initial phase with extraction and a terminal phase without extraction . The time horizon with extraction is determined endogenously . The model doe not assume separability of the objective function . The purpose here is to demonstrate that relatively simple deviation from the standard assumption , such a linear decay and no consumer awareness , may have large effect . Sensitivity analysis indicate large difference in the optimal extraction period , the total level of extraction and cumulative emission depending on the form of the decay function and the presence of consumer ' awareness for the environment .

aVIn August 2006 , die blue tongue virus ( BTV-type South Africa serotype 9 ) wa detected for the first time in cattle blood probe in the Netherlands , immediately followed by case in Belgium and in cattle on German farm , which were situated close to Aachen at the border to those country . Within le than 2 month the disease spread eastward crossing the Rhine , southward to Luxemburg and to Northern France . At the end of the year 2006 , nearly 1,000 farm were affected in Germany . Catches on two German cattle farm proved that the ceratopogonid specie Culicoides obsoletus wa obviously the vector , since many females-fed and unfed ones-were found to be infected with this virus . This sudden outbreak of bluetongue disease ( BTD ) is surely not a primary result of global wan-ning , but rather an effect of globalization-i.e . the intensive worldwide import and export of animal ; but a hot summer , a in 2006 , and a warm winter like that of the year 2006/2007 supported the new spread starting again in mass in August 2007 leading to 596 PCR-confirmed case until then with more than 200,000 animal infected . Thus , new agent coming from elsewhere have only a chance to spread if appropriate vector are available and the condition remain favourable during a reasonably long period . Effects of global warming-of course-will support persistence of such outbreak of disease due to offering of spreading of imported virus , bacteria and/or parasite .

aVThis paper test the hypothesis that continental chemical weathering increased during the initial Eocene thermal maximum ( IETM ) by comparing paleosols that formed before and during the event in western Texas . The chemical index of alteration ( CIA ) wa used to investigate the weathering of silicate mineral . Paleosols generated before the IETM have CIA value ranging from 62 to 72 , and CIA value during the IETM range from 67 to 82 . The CIA value for pre-initial Eocene thermal maximum paleosols indicate moderate weathering condition , and CIA value during the event indicate moderate to extreme weathering condition . The clay mineralogy of the paleosols is dominated by smectite , and it is only within paleosols that formed during the IETM that there is a change . There is a notable increase in the amount of kaolinite in one paleosol horizon that is associated with the carbon excursion . In addition , there is an increase in the translocation of clay and iron , and an increase in the leaching of calcite and plagioclase in initial Eocene thermal maximum paleosols . The difference between soil that formed before and during the initial Eocene thermal maximum indicate that chemical weathering did increase during this ancient global warming event . The mechanism responsible for increased weathering is interpreted to be an increase in hydrolysis reaction caused by an increase in humidity and an increase of carbonic acid in the soil due to elevated CO2 level during the initial Eocene thermal maximum . Documentation of an increase in chemical weathering during the initial Eocene thermal maximum is significant because it may have served a a negative feedback to reduce atmospheric CO2 .

aVThe Pleistocene Earth history ha been characterized by major climatic fluctuation . During glacial period , ice may have covered around 30 per cent of the Earth surface compared to approximately 10 per cent nowadays . With global change , polar environment and other montainous glacial environment of the world are presently undergoing the most important change since the end of the Last Glacial Maximum and are experiencing paraglacial and paraperiglacial geomorphological readjustment . Paraglacial and paraperiglacial landsystems consist of several subsystem including gravitational , fluvial , coastal , aeolian and lacustrine environment . Paraglacial and paraperiglacial landsystems can be analysed a open and complex landsystems characterized by energy , water and sediment flux and exchange with surrounding environment , especially with glacial and periglacial landsystems a input . Those cascading landsystems are likely to react to climate change because they rely on an ice-cold water stock ( glacier and permafrost ) that developed during a previous cold sequence ( glaciation ) . The response of paraglacial and paraperiglacial system to climatic forcing take place over a long time span ranging from an immediate reaction to several millennium . The spatial limit of paraglacial and paraperiglacial landsystems are inherently dependant on the time scale over which the system is analyzed . During the Pleistocene , glaciation widely affected the high latitude and the high altitude of the Earth and were followed by inherited paraglacial sequence . Glacier foreland in Arctic and alpine area experience paraglacial process with the present warming . The expected global warming for the twenty-first century will result in significant impact on present glacier area in mountain and could result in the appearance of new area for paraglacial dynamic . In permafrost terrain , landscape underwent a similar paraperiglacial geomorphological adjustment in mountainous , continental and coastal area , with permafrost thaw-degradation and thermokarst process .

aVIn North America broad-based research network explore the interaction of vertebrate , their characteristic array of pathogen and emergent disease . A diversity of programme address the impact of environmental change on animal health , zoonosis , and human health , but a yet no comprehensive framework or strategy ha emerged to develop and implement policy and planning . In a regime of climate change and ecological perturbation , the need to document and understand the health , agricultural , societal and economic impact of pathogen and emerging infectious disease is urgent . An integrated and proactive planning process linking national and international resource can lead to informed prediction about the impact of environmental change and can identify pathway for potential management and mitigation . An effective and comprehensive programme will have component for establishing priority , developing primary data for faunal structure and biodiversity , a capacity for monitoring and surveillance ( including scanning and targeted activity ) , and linkage to historical and contemporary baseline ( against which to ass change ) established through archival biological collection . Field and laboratory study are also necessary to determine developmental threshold , tolerance and tipping point for many pathogen to establish a context for recognising current constraint and future perturbation , and to explore factor that promote emergence for a variety of pathogen , vector and pest specie . Predictive modelling and risk assessment utilising a range of scenario for climate change is a final step in this multidisciplinary process .

aVTransport vehicle greatly pollute the environment through emission such a CO , CO2 , NOx , SOx , unburnt or partially burnt HC and particulate emission . Fossil fuel are the chief contributor to urban air pollution and major source of green house gas ( GHGs ) and considered to be the prime cause behind the global climate change . Biofuels are renewable , can supplement fossil fuel , reduce GHGs and mitigate their adverse effect on the climate resulting from global warming . This paper present the result of performance and emission analysis carried out in an unmodified diesel engine fueled with Pongamia pinnata methyl ester ( PPME ) and it blend with diesel . Engine test have been conducted to get the comparative measure of brake specific fuel consumption ( BSFC ) , brake specific energy consumption ( BSEC ) and emission such a CO , CO2 , HC , NO , to evaluate the behaviour of PPME and diesel in varying proportion . The result reveal that blend of PPME with diesel up to 40 % by volume ( B40 ) provide better engine performance ( BSFC and BSEC ) and improved emission characteristic . ( c ) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

aVThe extratropical annular-mode-like atmospheric response to ENSO and global warming and the internal variability of annular mode are associated with similar , yet distinct , dynamical characteristic . In particular , La Nina , global warming , and the positive phase of annular mode are all associated with a poleward shift of midlatitude jet stream and surface westerly . To improve understanding of these phenomenon , the author identify and compare pattern of interannual variability and global warming trend in the midlatitude surface westerly and the space-time spectrum of associated eddy momentum flux by analyzing simulation of the present climate in an atmosphere-only climate model , in which the ENSO-induced extratropical response is validated with that in reanalysis data , and by projection of future climate change using a coupled atmosphere-ocean model . While the response to ENSO is consistent with the refraction of midlatitude eddy due to subtropical wind anomaly , the interannual internal variability of the annular mode mark a change in the eastward propagation speed of midlatitude eddy . In response to global warming , the dominant eddy exhibit a trend toward faster eddy phase speed in both hemisphere , in a manner similar to the positive phase of interannual internal variability . These diagnosis suggest that the annular mode trend due to greenhouse gas increase may be more related to extratropical process , especially in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere , rather than being forced from the deep tropic .

aVPhenological timing of leaf budburst in plant is important for growth , since early budburst timing extends the growth period of the plant . We estimated the effect of climate change on the phenological budburst timing of four tree throughout four site in Japan , a region with few study on this topic . The leaf budburst date of plant ha advanced or been stable during the last five decade in these four Japanese locality . This fact is due to the negative relationship between date and temperature using multiple regression model , observed at all site . Climate change ha shifted budburst phenology in Japan with the increase of spring temperature . However , precipitation did not show any effect on budburst timing . At two budburst date of three tree specie had not remarkably changed or delayed through-sites , out the past five decade . There were difference between locality at the same latitude .

aVEcosystem response to key climate driver are reflected in phenological dynamic such a the timing and degree of `` green-up '' that integrate response over spatial scale from individual plant to ecosystem . This integration is clearest in ecosystem dominated by a single specie or life form , such a seasonally dynamic grassland or more temporally constant evergreen forest . Yet many ecosystem have substantial contribution of cover from both herbaceous and woody evergreen plant . Responses of mixed woody herbaceous ecosystem to climate are of increasing concern due to their extensive nature , the potential for such system to yield more complex response than those dominated by a single life form , and projection that extreme climate and weather event will increase in frequency and intensity with global warming . We present response of a mixed woody-herbaceous ecosystem type to an extreme event : regional-scale pinon pine mortality following an extended drought and the subsequent herbaceous green-up following the first wet period after the drought . This example highlight how reduction in greenness of the slower , more stable evergreen woody component can rapidly be offset by increase associated with resource made available to the relatively more responsive herbaceous component . We hypothesize that such two-phase phenological response to extreme event are characteristic of many mixed woody herbaceous ecosystem .

aVUltraviolet solar radiation ( UVR ) and atmospheric nutrient load to pristine ecosystem are global climate change phenomenon that simultaneously affect aquatic organism in way not easily predicted by single factor study . Plankton in a high mountain lake wa exposed in situ to increasing phosphorus ( P ) concentration ( mimicking atmospheric pulse ) in absence or presence of UVR in order to identify their interactive effect on functional [ primary production , organic carbon ( C ) release ( EOC ) , and percentage of C released ( % EOC ) ] , growth rate , structural-physiological ( algal biomass , sestonic C , P content , chlorophyll a ( Chl a ) , and Chl a : C ratio , P cell quota , cell-specific Chl a ) , and stoichiometric ( autotroph C : P ratio ) trait . The availability of P after the pulse determined the intensity of response by primary producer to UVR stress . All structural-physiological and functional variable significantly increased by up to two order of magnitude in response to P enrichment . UV radiation , over a long-term scale , exerted significant deleterious effect on most structural-physiological variable when inorganic P wa added at high level ( > = 30 mu g PL-1 ) . The subsequent unexpected negative synergistic UVR x P effect on algal development did not support our initial hypothesis that P input might buffer the harmful UVR effect . UVR exerted a weak negative effect on primary production but strongly enhanced the absolute and percentage excretion of C ( up to 60 % ) , mechanism responsible of a significant reduction in autotroph C : P ratio . We propose that low sestonic C : P ratio are the outcome of an adaptive strategy of algae in environment with high UVR exposure and extreme nutrient limitation and have important implication for C flux through grazing vs. microbial food web in oligotrophic system .

aV1 . Plant community in natural ecosystem are changing and specie are being lost due to anthropogenic impact including global warming and increasing nitrogen ( N ) deposition . We removed dominant specie , combination of specie and entire functional type from Alaskan tussock tundra , in the presence and absence of fertilization , to examine the effect of non-random specie loss on plant interaction and ecosystem functioning . 2 . After 6 year , growth of remaining specie had compensated for biomass loss due to removal in all treatment except the combined removal of moss , Betula nana and Ledum palustre ( MBL ) , which removed the most biomass . Total vascular plant production returned to control level in all removal treatment , including MBL . Inorganic soil nutrient availability , a indexed by resin , returned to control level in all unfertilized removal treatment , except MBL . 3 . Although biomass compensation occurred , the specie that provided most of the compensating biomass in any given treatment were not from the same functional type ( growth form ) a the removed specie . This provides empirical evidence that functional type based on effect trait are not the same a functional type based on response to perturbation . Calculations based on redistributing N from the removed specie to the remaining specie suggested that dominant specie from other functional type contributed most of the compensatory biomass . 4 . Fertilization did not increase total plant community biomass , because increase in graminoid and deciduous shrub biomass were offset by decrease in evergreen shrub , moss and lichen biomass . Fertilization greatly increased inorganic soil nutrient availability . 5 . In fertilized removal treatment , deciduous shrub and graminoids grew more than expected based on their performance in the fertilized intact community , while evergreen shrub , moss and lichen all grew le than expected . Deciduous shrub performed better than graminoids when B. nana wa present , but not when it had been removed . 6 . Synthesis . Terrestrial ecosystem response to warmer temperature and greater nutrient availability in the Arctic may result in vegetative stable-states dominated by either deciduous shrub or graminoids . The current relative abundance of these dominant growth form may serve a a predictor for future vegetation composition .

aVWe estimated the impact of global climate change on lodgepole pine ( Pinus contorta Dougl . ex Loud . var . latifolia Engelm . ) site productivity in Alberta based on the Alberta Climate Model and the A2 SRES climate change scenario projection from three global circulation model ( CGCM2 , HADCM3 , and ECHAM4 ) . Considerable warming is apparent in all three model . On average , the increase in mean GDD ( 5 ) ( growing degree-daysa > 5C ) are 18 % , 38 % , and 65 % by the 2020s , 2050s , and 2080s , respectively . Change in precipitation is essentially nil . This result in proportional increase in dryness index . We used the dryness index to predict the potential future range and GDD ( 5 ) to predict it potential productivity . Generally , lodgepole pine site index is predicted to increase steadily by 3m for each 30-year period . Offsetting this increase is a large reduction in suitable area a drying increase . At first , the warming increase the potential range up to 67 % by the 2020s but then shrink from 34 % to 58 % of it current area by 2080 . Such major change will need to be considered when setting long-term forest management plan . The increased risk of both wildfire and insect outbreak further compound this planning problem , especially because these disturbance event can interact and further increase risk .

aVBackground and Aims Relationships between autumn flowering , precipitation and temperature of plant specie of Mediterranean coastal shrublands have been described , but not analysed experimentally . These relationship were analysed for two specie of co-occurring , dominant , autumn-flowering shrub , Globularia alypum and Erica multiflora , over 4 year and in experimentally generated drought and warming condition . The aim wa to improve prediction about the response and adaptation of flowering of Mediterranean vegetation to climate change . Methods Beginning of anthesis and date of maximum flowering intensity ( 'peak date ' ) were monitored over 4 year ( 2001-2004 ) on a garrigue land type in the noth-east of the Iberian Peninsula . Two experimental treatment were applied , increased temperature ( +0.73 degree C ) and reduced soil moisture ( -17 % ) relative to untreated plot . Key Results Flowering of Globularia alypum and Erica multiflora differed greatly between year depending on the precipitation of the previous month and the date of the last substantial rainfall ( > 10 mm ) . Globularia alypum flowered once or twice ( unimodal or bimodal ) a the result of difference in the distribution and magnitude of precipitation in late-spring and summer ( when floral bud develop ) . The drought treatment delayed and decreased flowering of Globularia alypum in 2001 and delayed flowering in 2002 . Warming extended the period between the beginning of flowering and the end of the second peak for autumn flowering in 2001 and also increased peak intensity in 2002 . Flowering of Erica multiflora wa unaffected by either treatment . Conclusions Autumn flowering of Globularia alypum and Erica multiflora is more dependent on water availability than on temperature . Considerable inter-annual plasticity in the beginning of anthesis and peak date and on unimodal or bimodal flowering constitutes a 'safe strategy ' for both specie in relation to varying precipitation and temperature . However , severe change in precipitation in spring and summer may severely affect flowering of Globularia alypum but not Erica multiflora , thus affecting development/structure of the ecosystem if such condition persist .

aVOcean iron fertilization ( OIF ) is being considered a a strategy for mitigating rising atmospheric CO2 concentration . One model for implementation is the sale of carbon offset . Modeling study predict that OIF ha the potential to produce a material difference in the rise of atmospheric CO2 over the next several decade , but this could only be attained by alteration of the ecosystem and biogeochemical cycle of much of the world 's ocean . The efficacy of OIF on this scale ha not been proven . However , the consequence of successful implementation must be considered now , for 2 important reason : ( 1 ) to determine if the environmental effect would be predictable and verifiable , and if so , acceptable ; and ( 2 ) to establish whether the basis for valuing carbon offsets-an accurate audit of net reduction in cumulative greenhouse gas potential over 100 yr-can be met . Potential side-effects of widespread OIF that must be considered include a reduced supply of macronutrients to surface water downstream of fertilized region , increased emission of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide and methane , and change in the extent or frequency of coastal hypoxia . Given the uncertainty inherent in ocean model , prediction of environmental effect must be backed up by measurement . Thus , to go forward with confidence that the effect of rising CO2 could indeed be mitigated through OIF over the next century , and to establish the foundation for auditing carbon offset , it must be explicitly demonstrated that method exist to predict and detect downstream effect of OIF against the background of both climate variability and global warming . We propose that until the side-effects of widespread OIF can be shown to be verifiable-and there is good reason to believe that they can not - OIF should not be considered a viable technology for climate mitigation .

aVHabitat condition mediate the effect of climate , so neighboring population with differing habitat condition may differ in their response to climate change . We have previously observed that juvenile survival in Snake River spring/summer Chinook salmon is strongly correlated with summer temperature in some population and with fall streamflow in others . Here , we explore potential differential response of the viability of four of these population to change in streamflow and temperature that might result from climate change . First , we linked predicted change in air temperature and precipitation from several General Circulation Models to a local hydrological model to project streamflow and air temperature under two climate-change scenario . Then , we developed a stochastic , density-dependent life-cycle model with independent environmental effect in juvenile and ocean stage , and parameterized the model for each population . We found that mean abundance decreased 20-50 % and the probability of quasi-extinction increased dramatically ( from 0.1-0.4 to 0.3-0.9 ) for all population in both scenario . Differences between population were greater in the more moderate climate scenario than in the more extreme , hot/dry scenario . Model result were relatively robust to realistic uncertainty in freshwater survival parameter in all scenario . Our result demonstrate that detailed population model can usefully incorporate climate-change prediction , and that global warming pose a direct threat to freshwater stage in these fish , increasing their risk of extinction . Because difference in habitat may contribute to the individualistic population response we observed , we infer that maintaining habitat diversity will help buffer some specie from the impact of climate change .

aVA new , low-order Earth System Model is described , calibrated and tested against Earth system data . The model feature module for the atmosphere , ocean , ocean sediment , land biosphere and lithosphere and ha been designed to simulate global change on time scale of year to million of year . The atmosphere module considers radiation balance , meridional transport of heat and water vapor between low-mid latitude and high latitude zone , heat and gas exchange with the ocean and sea ice and snow cover . Gases considered are carbon dioxide and methane for all three carbon isotope , nitrous oxide and oxygen . The ocean module ha 100 m vertical resolution , carbonate chemistry and prescribed circulation and mixing . Ocean biogeochemical tracer are phosphate , dissolved oxygen , dissolved inorganic carbon for all three carbon isotope and alkalinity . Biogenic production of particulate organic matter in the ocean surface layer depends on phosphate availability but with lower efficiency in the high latitude zone , a determined by model fit to ocean data . The calcite to organic carbon rain ratio depends on surface layer temperature . The semi-analytical , ocean sediment module considers calcium carbonate dissolution and oxic and anoxic organic matter remineralisation . The sediment is composed of calcite , non-calcite mineral and reactive organic matter . Sediment porosity profile are related to sediment composition and a bioturbated layer of 0.1 m thickness is assumed . A sediment segment is ascribed to each ocean layer and segment area stem from observed ocean depth distribution . Sediment burial is calculated from sedimentation velocity at the base of the bioturbated layer . Bioturbation rate and oxic and anoxic remineralisation rate depend on organic carbon rain rate and dissolved oxygen concentration . The land biosphere module considers leaf , wood , litter and soil . Net primary production depends on atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and remineralization rate in the litter and soil are related to mean atmospheric temperature . Methane production is a small fraction of the soil remineralization . The lithosphere module considers outgassing , weathering of carbonate and silicate rock and weathering of rock containing old organic carbon and phosphorus . Weathering rate are related to mean atmospheric temperature . A pre-industrial , steady state calibration to Earth system data is carried out . Ocean observation of temperature , carbon 14 , phosphate , dissolved oxygen , dissolved inorganic carbon and alkalinity constrain air-sea exchange and ocean circulation , mixing and biogeochemical parameter . Observed calcite and organic carbon distribution and inventory in the ocean sediment help constrain sediment module parameter . Carbon isotopic data and carbonate vs. silicate weathering fraction are used to estimate initial lithosphere outgassing and rock weathering rate . Model performance is tested by simulating atmospheric greenhouse gas increase , global warming and model tracer evolution for the period 1765 to 2000 , a forced by prescribed anthropogenic greenhouse gas input and other anthropogenic and natural forcing . Long term , transient model behavior is studied with a set of 100 000 year simulation , forced by a slow , 5000 Gt C input of CO ( 2 ) to the atmosphere , and with a 1.5 million year simulation , forced by a doubling of lithosphere CO ( 2 ) outgassing .

aVGlobal warming is inevitable . Therefore , the need is to develop strategy to reduce the greenhouse gas from the atmosphere . Carbon sequestration through biomass seems to be a cheap and viable option . There are several land-use option which can sequester carbon . Their potential of locking carbon differs not only with the type of specie , but also with the agroclimatic zone . Hence , location-specific land-use system need to be prioritized taking both carbon sequestration potential and socio-economic need into account . It wa found that in the terai zone of West Bengal , fallow land and agricultural field sequester 5.86 % and 4.73 % carbon respectively , compared to the natural forest of Shorea robusta . However , agroforestry system , viz . tea garden and agrihorticulture contributed 24.24 % and 9.09 % carbon respectively . The agrihorticulture system while sequestering carbon also provides agricultural . crop and other economic gain , including carbon credit , and hence seems to be the best option . The potential of carbon storage of tree + crop-based system can be further increased using improved planting material of perennial component .

aVGlobal warming is the most important science issue of the 21st century , challenging the very structure of our global society . The study of past climate ha shown that the current global climate system is extremely sensitive to human-induced climate change . The burning of fossil fuel since the beginning of the industrial revolution ha already caused change with clear evidence for a 0.75 degree C rise in global temperature and 22 cm rise in sea level during the 20th century . The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change synthesis report ( 2007 ) predicts that global temperature by 2100 could rise by between 1.1 degree C and 6.4 degree C. Sea level could rise by between 28 cm and 79 cm , more if the melting of the polar ice cap accelerates . In addition , weather pattern will become le predictable and the occurrence of extreme climate event , such a storm , flood , heat wave and drought , will increase . The potential effect of global warming on human society are devastating . We do , however , already have many of the technological solution to cure our sick planet .

aVRecent and potential future increase in global temperature are likely to be associated with impact on the hydrologic cycle , including change to precipitation and increase in extreme event such a drought . We analyze change in drought occurrence using soil moisture data for the SRES B1 , A1B and A2 future climate scenario relative to the PICNTRL pre-industrial control and 20C3M twentieth century simulation from eight AOGCMs that participated in the IPCC AR4 . Comparison with observation forced land surface model estimate indicates that the model do reasonably well at replicating our best estimate of twentieth century , large scale drought occurrence , although the frequency of long-term ( more than 12-month duration ) drought are over-estimated . Under the future projection , the model show decrease in soil moisture globally for all scenario with a corresponding doubling of the spatial extent of severe soil moisture deficit and frequency of short-term ( 4-6-month duration ) drought from the mid-twentieth century to the end of the twenty-first . Long-term drought become three time more common . Regionally , the Mediterranean , west African , central Asian and central American region show large increase most notably for long-term frequency a do mid-latitude North American region but with larger variation between scenario . In general , change under the higher emission scenario , A1B and A2 are the greatest , and despite following a reduced emission pathway relative to the present day , the B1 scenario show smaller but still substantial increase in drought , globally and for most region . Increases in drought are driven primarily by reduction in precipitation with increased evaporation from higher temperature modulating the change . In some region , increase in precipitation are offset by increased evaporation . Although the predicted future change in drought occurrence are essentially monotonic increasing globally and in many region , they are generally not statistically different from contemporary climate ( a estimated from the 1961-1990 period of the 20C3M simulation ) or natural variability ( a estimated from the PICNTRL simulation ) for multiple decade , in contrast to primary climate variable , such a global mean surface air temperature and precipitation . On the other hand , change in annual and seasonal mean of terrestrial hydrologic variable , such a evaporation and soil moisture , are essentially undetectable within the twenty-first century . Changes in the extreme of climate and their hydrological impact may therefore be more detectable than change in their mean .

aVBenthic dinoflagellate of the genus Ostreopsis are important component of subtropical and tropical marine coral reef-lagoonal environment . Currently , a a result of global warming and trade globalization , they are also distributed worldwide . These microalgae are shown to produce palytoxin , one of the most potent non-protein marine toxin known . The haemolytic assay is a very easy , rapid and sensitive method to determine palytoxin . However , under the condition reported in previous work this assay is inadequate for a rigorous dose-response treatment , since : ( 1 ) it produce degenerate sigmoidal profile , with a pronounced slope which make the calculation of the ED50 very sensitive to the experimental err or ; ( 2 ) at the usual work temperature , the in vitro stability of the system is low , which accentuates the variability and ambiguity of the response . To resolve these problem haemolysis of sheep erythrocyte is studied , including it 's toxicological dynamic , kinetics , inhibition by ouabain and response to temperature . The result show that , to obtain a smoother , more stable and reproducible response , it is necessary to apply two resource simultaneously : operation at a moderate temperature and partial inhibition of the palytoxin by ouabain . It also produce highly reliable parameter and allows strict equivalencies to be established with the mouse bioassay , a traditional reference point , though bioethically questionable and 20 time le sensitive than the bioassay proposed here .

aVMitigating global climate change requires not only government action but also cooperation from consumer . Population-based , cross-sectional survey were conducted among 1202 respondent in Portland OR and Houston TX between June and September 2007 regarding awareness , concern , and behavior change related to climate change . The data were subjected to both quantitative and qualitative analysis . Awareness about climate change is virtually universal ( 98 % in Portland and 92 % in Houston ) with the vast majority reporting some level of concern ( 90 % in Portland and 82 % in Houston ) . A multivariate analysis revealed significant predictor of behavior change : individual with heightened concern about climate change ( p < 0.001 ) ; respondent with higher level of education ( p = 0.03 ) ; younger compared with older individual ( p < 0.001 ) ; and Portlanders more likely to change behavior compared with Houstonians ( p < 0.001 ) . Of those who changed behavior , 43 % reported having reduced their energy usage at home , 39 % had reduced gasoline consumption , and 26 % engaged in other behavior , largely recycling . Qualitative data indicate a number of cognitive , behavioral , and structural obstacle to voluntary mitigation . Although consumer are interested in global climate change-mitigation strategy and willing to act accordingly , considerable impediment remain . Government policy must eliminate economic , structural , and social barrier to change and advance accessible and economical alternative . Individual-level mitigation can be a policy option under favorable contextual condition , a these result indicate , but must be accompanied by mitigation effort from industry , commerce , and government .

aVIt is critical to understand how the public prioritizes multiple forestry value when establishing objective for sustainable forest management . While this is a complex and difficult task , a necessary step is to elicit a broad range of public opinion in forest planning to ensure that decision serve the need of various forest stakeholder and society at large . This study seek to understand how six forest dependent community in British Columbia prioritize a number of attribute associated with sustainable forest management by using a simple survey-based measurement tool , the Thurstone scale . The result suggest that ecological attribute are a higher priority for survey respondent followed by quality of life , global warming , and economic consideration . This paper explores some of the ramification of the priority for sustainable forest management measured in these six community a well a implication for using the Thurstone scale in process like Public Advisory Groups .

aVVehicle externality cost include emission of greenhouse and other gas ( affecting global warming and human health ) , crash cost ( imposed on crash partner ) , roadway congestion , and space consumption , among others . These five source of external cost by vehicle make and model were estimated for the top-selling passenger car and light-duty truck in the US . Among these external cost , those associated with crash and congestion are estimated to be the most practically significant . When crash cost are included , the worst offender ( in term of highest external cost ) were found to be pickup . If crash cost are removed from the comparison , the worst offender tend to be four pickup and a very large SUV : the Ford F-350 and F-250 , Chevrolet Silverado 3500 . Dodge Ram 3500 , and Hummer H2 , respectively . Regardless of how the cost are estimated , they are considerable in magnitude , and nearly on par with vehicle purchase price .

aVA crucial issue in the current global warming debate is the effect of vegetation and soil on carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) concentration in the atmosphere . Vegetation can extract CO2 through photosynthesis , but respiration , decay of soil organic matter and disturbance effect such a fire return it to the atmosphere . The balance of these process is the net carbon flux . To estimate the biospheric carbon flux for England and Wales , we address the statistical problem of inference for the sum of multiple output from a complex deterministic computer code whose input parameter are uncertain . The code is a process model which simulates the carbon dynamic of vegetation and soil , including the amount of carbon that is stored a a result of photosynthesis and the amount that is returned to the atmosphere through respiration . The aggregation of output corresponding to multiple site and type of vegetation in a region give an estimate of the total carbon flux for that region over a period of time . Expert prior opinion are elicited for marginal uncertainty about the relevant input parameter and for correlation of input between site . A Gaussian process model is used to build emulator of the multiple code output and Bayesian uncertainty analysis is then used to propagate uncertainty in the input parameter through to uncertainty on the aggregated output . Numerical result are presented for England and Wales in the year 2000 . It is estimated that vegetation and soil in England and Wales constituted a net sink of 7.55 Mt C ( 1 Mt C = 10 ( 12 ) g of carbon ) in 2000 , with standard deviation 0.56 Mt C resulting from the source of uncertainty that are considered .

aV1 . Variation in climate is predicted to increase over much of the planet this century . Forecasting specie persistence with climate change thus requires understanding of how population respond to climate variability , and the mechanism underlying this response . Variable rainfall is well known to drive fluctuation in annual plant population , yet the degree to which population response is driven by between-year variation in germination cueing , water limitation or competitive suppression is poorly understood . 2 . We used demographic monitoring and population model to examine how three seed banking , rare annual plant of the California Channel Islands respond to natural variation in precipitation and their competitive environment . Island plant are particularly threatened by climate change because their current range are unlikely to overlap region that are climatically favourable in the future . 3 . Species showed 9 to 100-fold between-year variation in plant density over the 5-12 year of censusing , including a severe drought and a wet El Nino year . During the drought , population size were low for all specie . However , even in non-drought year , population size and per caput growth rate showed considerable temporal variation , variation that wa uncorrelated with total rainfall . These population fluctuation were instead correlated with the temperature after the first major storm event of the season , a germination cue for annual plant . 4 . Temporal variation in the density of the focal specie wa uncorrelated with the total vegetative cover in the surrounding community , suggesting that variation in competitive environment doe not strongly determine population fluctuation . At the same time , the uncorrelated response of the focal specie and their competitor to environmental variation may favour persistence via the storage effect . 5 . Population growth rate analysis suggested differential endangerment of the focal annual . Elasticity analysis and life table response experiment indicated that variation in germination ha the same potential a the seed produced per germinant to drive variation in population growth rate , but only the former wa clearly related to rainfall . 6 . Synthesis . Our work suggests that future change in the timing and temperature associated with the first major rain , acting through germination , may more strongly affect population persistence than change in season-long rainfall .

aVGreat Lakes water level have fluctuated over thousand of year . High water level were a problem in the 1980s , but a recent sudden drop in Lakes Michigan and Huron ha caused particular concern , in part because lower water level are consistent with many global climate change scenario . We examined water level data ( 1860-2006 ) representing Lakes Michigan and Huron to evaluate change in both long-term and seasonal pattern over time , and explore relationship with candidate predictor variable . Our tool for this analysis included both Seasonal Trend decomposition using Loess ( STL ) , and dynamic linear model ( DLM ) . In addition to the recent decline , STL result reveal a sustained decline around 1900 , a long-term periodicity of similar to 30 year , and an unexpected correspondence with sunspot activity . DLM result indicate a relationship with precipitation over a three-year lagged period , which ha been essentially unchanging from 1900 to present . Additionally , the DLM highlight an underlying lake level decline beginning in 1973 and continuing to the present , which may have been obscured by concurrently increasing precipitation into the 1990s . The current underlying decline might be related to a simultaneous evaporation increase , however , our model could not confirm this relationship , possibly due to the shorter period of record for evaporation data . We can not be certain that the present observed water level drop is caused by factor related to global climate change , or that it portends a long-term problem . However , because the underlying decline ha been ongoing for similar to 33 year it may be prudent to include lower lake level in future management planning .

aVAnthropogenic stratospheric aerosol production , so a to reduce solar insolation and cool Earth , ha been suggested a an emergency response to geoengineer the planet in response to global warming . While volcanic eruption have been suggested a innocuous example of stratospheric aerosol cooling the planet , the volcano analog actually argues against geoengineering because of ozone depletion and regional hydrologic and temperature response . To further investigate the climate response , here we simulate the climate response to both tropical and Arctic stratospheric injection of sulfate aerosol precursor using a comprehensive atmosphere-ocean general circulation model , the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Goddard Institute for Space Studies ModelE . We inject SO ( 2 ) and the model convert it to sulfate aerosol , transport the aerosol and remove them through dry and wet deposition , and calculates the climate response to the radiative forcing from the aerosol . We conduct simulation of future climate with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change A1B business-as-usual scenario both with and without geoengineering and compare the result . We find that if there were a way to continuously inject SO ( 2 ) into the lower stratosphere , it would produce global cooling . Tropical SO ( 2 ) injection would produce sustained cooling over most of the world , with more cooling over continent . Arctic SO ( 2 ) injection would not just cool the Arctic . Both tropical and Arctic SO ( 2 ) injection would disrupt the Asian and African summer monsoon , reducing precipitation to the food supply for billion of people . These regional climate anomaly are but one of many reason that argue against the implementation of this kind of geoengineering .

aVIn it latest report , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) concludes that global climate change can still be slowed down if greenhouse gas emission are rapidly and strongly reduced . We present a detailed regional CO2 budget for the Alpine tourist region of Davos , Switzerland , including emission and potential sink . The aim of the study wa ( 1 ) to estimate the most important CO2 source and sink , ( 2 ) to identify the most efficient reduction measure and ( 3 ) to ass the feasibility of different reduction target . The result show that the emission due to heating contribute to a proportion of 86.3 % to the total budget , which is mainly due to the harsh local climate and the tourism-focused local economy . They also show that the yearly CO2 emission per caput in Davos exceed the Swiss average of 6 tonne by 25 % . The augmentation of the carbon pool through the natural environment compare to 10.3 % of the total emission , and further afforestation of the community forest can contribute to an improvement of the total budget by 2.6 % . The reduction aim of -15 % until 2015 ( compared with 2004 ) , a set by the municipality itself , could be easily reached through better building insulation and the use of renewable energy source . More ambitious aim , such a a 2000 W-society or CO2 neutrality , however , will not be realised without major drawback in living standard . ( C ) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVThe paper considers a relation between equilibrium global warming at doubled carbon dioxide ( climate sensitivity ) and the distribution of cloud and relative humidity in 18 state-of-the-art climate model . There is a strong correlation among three index : ( 1 ) model climate sensitivity , ( 2 ) mean cloud amount change due to global warming , and ( 3 ) the difference in cloud amount between the tropic and midlatitudes . In the simulation of the present-day current , model with high sensitivity produce smaller cloud amount in the tropic and larger cloud amount over midlatitude ocean than model with low sensitivity . The relative humidity in the tropic is smaller in model with high sensitivity than in model with low sensitivity . There is a similarity between vertical profile of cloud amount and relative humidity under global warming and vertical profile of the difference in these quantity averaged over the tropic and midlatitudes . Based on the correlation obtained and observation of cloud amount and relative humidity , an estimate is made of the sensitivity of a real climate system .

aVThe response of the ocean 's meridional overturning circulation ( MOC ) to increased greenhouse gas forcing is examined using a coupled model of intermediate complexity , including a dynamic 3-D ocean subcomponent . Parameters are the increase in CO ( 2 ) forcing ( with stabilization after a specified time interval ) and the model 's climate sensitivity . In this model , the cessation of deep sinking in the north `` Atlantic '' ( hereinafter , a `` collapse '' ) , a indicated by change in the MOC , behaves like a simple bifurcation . The final surface air temperature ( SAT ) change , which is closely predicted by the product of the radiative forcing and the climate sensitivity , determines whether a collapse occurs . The initial transient response in SAT is largely a function of the forcing increase , with higher sensitivity run exhibiting delayed behavior ; accordingly , high CO ( 2 ) -low sensitivity scenario can be assessed a a recovering or collapsing circulation shortly after stabilization , whereas low CO ( 2 ) -high sensitivity scenario require several hundred additional year to make such a determination . We also systemically examine how the rate of forcing , for a given CO ( 2 ) stabilization , affect the ocean response . In contrast with previous study based on result using simpler ocean model , we find that except for a narrow range of marginally stable to marginally unstable scenario , the forcing rate ha little impact on whether the run collapse or recovers . In this narrow range , however , forcing increase on a time scale of slow ocean advective process result in weaker decline in overturning strength and can permit a run to recover that would otherwise collapse .

aVTime-slices of eight global climate model ( GCM ) response simulation of the IPCC IS92a , CMIP2 , SRES A2 , B2 and A1B greenhouse gas scenario have been downscaled using the HIRHAM atmospheric regional climate model ( RCM ) . The area cover Central and Northern Europe , adjacent sea-areas and Greenland . The GCM data were provided from the Max Planck Institute , Germany ( MPI ) , the Hadley Centre , U.K. ( HC ) , the Bjerknes Centre , Norway ( BCCR ) and University of Oslo , Norway ( UiO ) . The resulting ensemble cover a range of future climate realization from different global model , different greenhouse gas scenario and natural climate variability . In order to present trend in statistical parameter including extreme event and their return period , the downscaled response data are combined a an ensemble of equally valid possible realization . The combined statistic is obtained after adjustment accounting for ( i ) different set-ups of the respective GCMs in producing the control climate and ( ii ) the variable range of time between the control and scenario period . We find that annual extreme event of daily precipitation and wind speed in the control climate become more frequent in the scenario period over large area in Northern Europe . The variability in the regional result appears sensitive to the phase of the Scandinavian pattern .

aVGlobal warming ha changed the distribution of forest of northeastern China . Larix are very important specie in this area . Predicting the potential distribution of Larix specie and their response to climate change would attract more and more attention . This paper predicted the potential distribution of three Larix specie based on 'climatic-topographic , relationship by logistic regression The result showed that L. gmelinii is predicted to retreat northwest-ward by 220 km by 2050 and by 270 km more by 2100 ; L. olgensis var . changpaiensis is predicted to retreat northwestward by 200 km by 2050 and by 190 to 300 km more by 2100 ; L. principis-rupprechtii is predicted to retreat northeastward by 200 km by 2050 km by 250 to 400 km more by 2100 . This indicated that L. gmelinii could have ita optimum latitude moved into Russia , L. olgensis var . changpaiensis could move to the small Xing'an Mountains and L. principis-rupprechtii would move to the middle part of the Great Xing'an Mountains .

aVA steep increase in jellyfish biomass , primarily Chrysaora melanaster , over the eastern Bering Sea shelf wa documented throughout the 1990s . Their biomass peaked in summer 2000 and then declined precipitously , stabilizing at a moderate level after 2001 . The onset of the outburst and decline coincided with transition between climatic regime . Specifically , 1989 marked the beginning of a period of moderate temperature in the eastern Bering Sea , after the warm condition of the late 19705 , through the 1980s . Very warm condition came to the eastern Bering after 2000 , a evidenced by decreased ice cover in winter and increased total heat content and surface water temperature in summer . We examined the relationship between jellyfish biomass and temperature , ice cover , atmospheric variable , current pattern , zooplankton biomass , and associated fish biomass in two region of the Middle Shelf Domain ( SE and NW ) by use of Generalized Additive Models ( GAM ) . We found density-dependent interaction within and between jellyfish biomass in the two region related to the flow regime , and demonstrated a linkage between biophysical index and jellyfish biomass . In particular , ice cover ( SE and NW ) , sea-surface temperature in spring ( SE ) and summer ( NW ) , and wind mixing ( SE ) all influenced jellyfish biomass . In addition , the importance of juvenile pollock biomass ( SE ) and zooplankton biomass ( NW ) suggest that jellyfish biomass wa sensitive to the availability of prey . Since most climate model suggest continued warming is likely in the Bering Sea , the jellyfish population may remain at moderate level there but will likely shift northward into the Arctic Ocean .

aVThe objective of this work wa to ass the potential impact of climate change on the spatial distribution of coffee nematode ( race of Meloidogyne incognita ) and leaf miner ( Leucoptera coffeella ) , using a Geographic Information System . Assessment of the impact of climate change on pest infestation and disease epidemic in crop is needed a a basis for revising management practice to minimize crop loss a climatic condition shift . Future scenario focused on the decade of the 2020 ' s , 2050 ' s , and 2080 ' s ( scenario A2 and B2 ) were obtained from five General Circulation Models available on Data Distribution Centre from Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change . Geographic distribution map were prepared using model to predict the number of generation of the nematode and leaf miner . Maps obtained in scenario A2 allowed prediction of an increased infestation of the nematode and of the pest , due to greater number of generation per month , than occurred under the climatological normal from 1961 - 1990 . The number of generation also increased in the B2 scenario , but wa lower than in the A2 scenario for both organism .

aVThis paper summarizes result of magnetostratigraphic and rock magnetic investigation performed on fluvial sediment from the Ludwigshafen-Parkinsel drilling project ( Upper Rhine Graben ( URG ) Germany ) . The drilling penetrated into Pleistocene gravel , sand , silt and clay , and unconsolidated Pliocene deposit . Its primary objective wa the exploration of groundwater resource in the area of Ludwigshafen . Our rock magnetic investigation together with result of heavy mineral analysis ( see Hagedorn & Boenigk , 2008 ) show a clearly structured sediment profile . It wa possible to identify the change from mainly locally controlled sedimentation from the Graben margin to a more distinct Alpine controlled sedimentation at a depth of 177 m by magnetic data . Based on lithostratigraphic correlation with other sedimentary record from the URG and also based on palynological evidence , this event happened at the end of Late Pliocene during a time of normal polarity of the Earth 's magnetic field ( Gauss Chron ? ) . The well-documented characteristic change in magneto-mineralogy from goethite to greigite almost at the same stratigraphic level , we interpret solely a a climatic signal which can be correlated with the global climate change at similar to 2.5 Ma that is well documented in a wide range of sedimentary environment ( e.g . deep-sea sediment , loess ) .

aVRole and potential of nuclear energy system in the energy option are discussed from the viewpoint of sustainable development with protecting from global warming by using the energy module structure of GRAPE model . The analysis with respect to carbon emission control and nuclear fissile transaction among region indicates the need of coordinated further development of energy conservation , renewable and nuclear energy , and rather drastic nuclear introduction in the presently developing world . The analysis also suggests the need of long-term planning and R & D effort under the wisdom . ( C ) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVGlobal climate change ha already affected the abundance , range limit , and interaction of many specie . The hemlock woolly adelgid ( Adelges tsugae ) , an invasive insect introduced to eastern North America from Japan , ha decimated stand of eastern hemlock ( Tsuga canadensis ) and Carolina hemlock ( T. caroliniana ) from Georgia to Connecticut . However , it spread across central and northern New England ha been slowed substantially by it inability to tolerate cold winter temperature . Using data from previous lab and field study collected over the past 17 year , including adelgid spread and overwintering mortality , we first characterize the temperature condition that may limit adelgid spread . We then show how , in the future , rising winter temperature due to climate change are likely to remove the condition currently limiting adelgid spread , and facilitate the northward expansion a more suitable habitat becomes available .

aVA bi-monthly underwater visual census wa conducted in the subtidal habitat of Nagahama , Wakasa Bay , Sea of Japan , over 5 year from January 2002 to December 2006 . A total of 83 fish specie and 63,328 individual were recorded over 120 1-h visual census composed of three 2x200 m transects . The number of both total individual ( abundance ) and specie ( richness ) were strongly correlated with the bottom-water temperature . Species richness wa greatest in summer ( July-September ) , with 10-20 specie per 400 m ( 2 ) supercript stop , when the sea-bottom temperature wa highest ( 24-28 degree C ) , and lowest in winter ( January-March ) , with 1-8 specie per 400 m ( 2 ) supercript stop , when the temperature wa lowest ( 10-12 degree C ) . Five specie , i.e. , rockfish , Sebastes inermis , wrasse , Pseudolabrus sieboldi , two specie of goby , Acentrogobius pflaumii and Tridentiger trigonocephalus , and pygmy filefish , Rudarius ercodes , were frequently observed and present in more than 200 of the total of 360 total transects . While the presence of most fish specie wa dependent on water temperature , some specie were independent of water temperature , including anchovy , Engraulis japonicus , S. inermis , wasp fish , Hypodytes rubripinnis , A. pflaumii and pufferfish , Takifugu poecilonotus . Jack mackerel , Trachurus japonicus , wa the most abundant fish , being most typically seen from spring through autumn , with a total of 21,850 individual observed over the whole census period . Some specie showed strong annual fluctuation in abundance . The interannual stability in fish abundance and specie richness wa probably because the fish assemblage wa composed of a sufficiently large number of specie , but with the number of each specie fluctuating over time . A comparison of the present survey to one in 1970-72 revealed that over the last 30 year southern fish specie have significantly increased whereas those indigenous to northern water have decreased .

aVConstructed wetland are considered to be important source of nitrous oxide ( N2O ) . In order to investigate the contribution of nitrification in N2O formation , some environmental factor , plant specie and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria ( AOB ) inactive layer have been compared . Vegetation cell indicated remarkable effect of season and different plant specie on N2O emission and AOB amount . Nitrous oxide data showed large temporal and Spatial fluctuation ranging 0-52.8 mg N2O m ( -2 ) d ( -1 ) . Higher AOB amount and N2O flux rate were observed in the Zizania latifolia cell , reflecting high potential of global warming . Roles of plant a ecosystem engineer are summarized with rhizosphere oxygen release and organic matter transportation to affect nitrogen transformation . The Phragmites australis cell contributed to keeping high T-N removal performance and lower N2O emission . The distribution of AOB also supported this result . Statistical analysis showed several environmental parameter affecting the strength of observed greenhouse gas emission , such a water temperature , water level , TOC , plant specie and plant cover .

aVSedimentary record in northern Tianshan are in response to the uplift of the Tianshan Mountain from the late Cenozoic . Eocene-Oligocene Anjihaihe formation mainly deposite gray or dark gray lacustrine mudstone with flat bedding ; Late Oligocene Shawan formation are overlain purple meander sandstone , siltstone and interbedded conglomerate are dominant ; the lower of Early Miocene Taxihe formation consist of gray or brownish siltstone and mudstone frequently coexist ; the upper are brownish or gray-yellowish sandstone with interbedded siltstone ; Late Miocene-Early Pliocene Dushanzi formation are composed of braided-fluvial accumulation of dark gray conglomerate or associated with brownish or gray-yellowish sandstone ; Late Pliocene-Early Pleistocene Xiyu formation consist of a large amount of alluvial fan pebble to boulder conglomerate . Stable carbon and oxygen isotopic data show : average VC value from Eocene-Oligocene , through Late Oligocene , lower of Early Miocene , upper of Early Miocene , Late Miocene-Early Pliocene to Late Pliocene-Early Pleistocene are similar to-3 . 9 part per thousand , similar to-8 . 1 part per thousand , similar to- 5 . 9 part per thousand , similar to- 8 . 5 part per thousand , similar to- 6 . 0 part per thousand respectively , while average delta O-18 value are similar to - 5 . 0 part per thousand , similar to - 11.0 part per thousand , similar to- 7 . 7 part per thousand , similar to- 10 . 3 part per thousand , similar to - 10 . 4 part per thousand respectively . Stable isotopic change and sedimentary record indicate paleoenvironmental change : warm-wet during Eocene-Oligocene , and and cold during Late Oligocene , semi-humid and semi-warm during lower of Early Miocene , and and cold during upper of Early Miocene , and and cold during Late Miocene-Early Pliocene , arid and semi-warm during Late Pliocene to Pleistocene . Combined with paleomagnetic data in this area , stable isotopic result , sedimentary record and global climate change , five paleoenvironmental change have developed in northern Tianshan since the late Cenozoic : climate conversion during late of Qligocene , climate break at Early Miocene ( similar to 24Ma ) , climate conversion during early of Miocene ( 24 similar to 19Ma ) , C-4 rapidly expand at Late Miocene ( similar to 7Ma ) and climate intensely vibrate at Late Pliocene to Early Pleistocene ( similar to 3 . 17Ma ) .

aVRecent global warming trend may have a significant impact on vector-borne viral disease , possibly affecting vector population dynamic and disease transmission . This study measured level of hemagglutination-inhibition ( HI ) antibody against Japanese encephalitis virus ( JEV ) and neutralizing antibody against Akabane virus ( AKAV ) and Aino virus ( AINV ) for Thoroughbred horse in Korea . Blood sample were collected from 989 racehorse in several province , between October 2005 and March 2007 . Sera were tested using either an HI assay or a virus neutralization test . Approximately half ( 49.7 % ; 492/989 ) of the horse tested were antibody-positive for JEV . The HI titer against JEV wa significantly correlated with racehorse age ( p < 0.05 ) . Horses with an HI antibody titer of 1 : 160 or higher accounted for 3.9 % of the animal tested , indicating that vector transmitting arthropod-borne virus bit relatively few horse . In contrast , 3.8 % ( 191497 ) and 19.5 % ( 97/497 ) of horse serum collected in March 2007 were positive against AKAV and AINV , respectively . The presence of antibody against AKAV and AINV may indicate the multiplication of AKAV and AINV in these horse .

aVThe Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum ( PETM , 55.8 Ma ) , an abrupt global warming event linked to a transient increase in pCO ( 2 ) , wa comparable in rate and magnitude to modern anthropogenic climate change . Here we use plant fossil from the Bighorn Basin of Wyoming to document the combined effect of temperature and pCO ( 2 ) on insect herbivory . We examined 5,062 fossil leaf from five site positioned before , during , and after the PETM ( 59-55.2 Ma ) . The amount and diversity of insect damage on angiosperm leaf , a well a the relative abundance of specialized damage , correlate with rising and failing temperature . All reach distinct maximum during the PETM , and every PETM plant specie is extensively damaged and colonized by specialized herbivore . Our study suggests that increased insect herbivory is likely to be a net long-term effect of anthropogenic pCO ( 2 ) increase and warming temperature .

aVIn order to study the effect of temperature enhancement on alpine calcareous grassland specie , a warming experiment wa carried out in the Berchtesgaden National Park ( Southeast Germany , Northern Calcareous Alps ) between 2002 and 2004 . The study wa conducted in stand of the Carex sempervirens and the Carex firma community ; the two most widespread grassland type in the alpine zone of the Northern Calcareous Alps . The temperature of the vegetation stand and the upper soil wa passively enhanced using open top chamber ( OTCs ) . The construction of the OTCs wa appropriate since temperature wa clearly increased while water condition ( humidity , soil water content ) were not changed . By comparing manipulated ( temperature enhancement ) with non-manipulated plot , the effect of warming on growth and reproduction of selected key specie were studied . To test if vegetation response to temperature enhancement is at least partly due to increase in nutrient availability , soil solution concentration of nitrate and ammonium were analysed . We found that most of the studied plant specie are sensitive to temperature enhancement . Growth and/or reproduction of 12 of the 14 studied specie were significantly stimulated by warming . Only two specie showed no response ; none of the specie experienced decrease in growth or reproduction . Dwarf shrub and graminoids showed a stronger response than herbaceous perennial . A significant effect of warming on nutrient availability could not be detected . The observed response of vegetation is therefore mainly caused by direct and not by indirect temperature effect .

aVMost state-of-the art global coupled model simulate a weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation ( MOC ) in climate change scenario but the mechanism leading to this weakening are still being debated . The third version of the CNRM ( Centre National de Recherches Meteorologiques ) global atmosphere-ocean-sea ice coupled model ( CNRM-CM3 ) wa used to conduct climate change experiment for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report ( IPCC AR4 ) . The analysis of the A1B scenario experiment show that global warming lead to a slowdown of North Atlantic deep ocean convection and thermohaline circulation south of Iceland . This slowdown is triggered by a freshening of the Arctic Ocean and an increase in freshwater outflow through Fram Strait . Sea ice melting in the Barents Sea induces a local amplification of the surface warming , which enhances the cyclonic atmospheric circulation around Spitzberg . This anti-clockwise circulation force an increase in Fram Strait outflow and a simultaneous increase in ocean transport of warm water toward the Barents Sea , favouring further sea ice melting and surface warming in the Barents Sea . Additionally , the retreat of sea ice allows more deep water formation north of Iceland and the thermohaline circulation strengthens there . The transport of warm and saline water toward the Barents Sea is further enhanced , which constitutes a second positive feedback .

aVSpatial and temporal distribution of vegetation net primary production ( NPP ) in China wa studied using three light-use efficiency model ( CASA , GLOPEM and GEOLUE ) and two mechanistic ecological process model ( CEVSA , GEOPRO ) . Based on spatial and temporal analysis ( e.g . monthly , seasonally and annually ) of simulated result from ecological process mechanism model of CASA , GLOPEM and CEVSA , the following conclusion could be made : ( 1 ) during the last 20 year , NPP change in China followed closely the seasonal change of climate affected by monsoon with an overall trend of increasing ; ( 2 ) simulated average seasonal NPP wa : 0.571 +/- 0.2 GtC in spring , 1.573 +/- 0.4 GtC in summer , 0.6 +/- 0.2 GtC in autumn , and 0.12 +/- 0.1 GtC in winter . Average annual NPP in China wa 2.864 +/- 1 GtC . All the five model were able to simulate seasonal and spatial feature of biomass for different ecological type in China . This paper provides a baseline for China 's total biomass production . It also offer a mean of estimating the NPP change due to afforestation , reforestation , conservation and other human activity and could aid people in using for-mentioned carbon sink to fulfill China 's commitment of reducing greenhouse gas .

aVSize measurement of the calcareous nannofossil taxon Discoaster multiradiatus were carried out across the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum ( PETM ) in Ocean Drilling Program Holes 690B ( Maud Rise , Weddell Sea ) and 1209B ( Shatsky Rise , Pacific Ocean ) . Morphometric investigation show that D. multiradiatus specimen are generally larger at ODP Site 1209 than at ODP Site 690 . A limited increase in size of D. multiradiatus is recorded at ODP Site 1209 , whereas significant enlargement characterize ODP Site 690 . Preservation is comparable at both site : nanno fossil are moderately preserved with some evidence of etching/overgrowth in the PETM interval . Yet , D. multiradiatus variation do not correlate with preservation state and morphometric data most likely represent primary signal rather than diagenetic artifact . There is a direct relationship between D. multiradiatus size and paleotemperatures : largest specimen are coeval with global warming associated with the PETM , inferred to result from excess atmospheric CO ( 2 ) due to ( partial ) oxidation of massive quantity of methane . Size increase and largest specimen of D. multiradiatus occur at different stratigraphic level within PETM at ODP Sites 690 and 1209 . A marked shift in diameter size wa observed at the onset and peak of the Carbon Isotopic Excursion ( CIE ) at ODP Site 690 , but only at the end of CIE and initial recovery interval at ODP Site 1209 . This diachroneity is puzzling , but indeed correlate well with reconstructed change in surface and thermocline water mass temperature and salinity in the PETM interval at low and high latitude . The presumed high concentration of carbon dioxide seem to have not influenced the morphometry of D. multiradiatus . The major size increase of D. multiradiatus in the CIE of ODP Site 690 could represent the migration of larger-sized allochtonus specimen that moved from peri-equatorial/subtropical area to higher latitude during the warmest interval of the PETM , although no direct evidence of distinct populations/subpopulations ha been obtained from the frequency diagram . As a result , we infer that D. multiradiatus is a proxy of water mass stratification and might be used for deriving temperature-salinity-nutrient condition in the mixed layer and thermocline and their dynamic .

aVManagement practice can influence soil CO2 emission and C content in cropland , which can effect global warming . We examined the effect of combination of irrigation , tillage , I cropping system , and N fertilization on soil CO2 flux , temperature , water , and C content at the 0- to 20-cm depth from May to November 2005 at two site in the northern Great Plains . Treatments were two irrigation system ( irrigated vs. non-irrigated ) and six management practice that contained tilled and no-tilled malt barley ( Hordeum vulgaris L. ) with 0 to 134 kg N ha ( -1 ) , no-tilled pea ( Pisum sativum L. ) , and a conservation reserve program ( CRP ) planting applied in Linen sandy loam ( sandy , mixed , frigid , Entic Haplustolls ) in western North Dakota . In eastern Montana , treatment were no-tilled malt barley with 78 kg N ha ( -1 ) , no-tilled rye ( Secale cereale L. ) , no-tilled Austrian winter pea , no-tilled fallow , and tilled fallow applied in dryland Williams loam ( fine-loamy , mixed Typic Argiborolls ) . Irrigation increased CO , flux by 13 % compared with non-irrigation by increasing soil water content in North Dakota . Tillage increased CO2 flux by 62 to 118 % compared with no-tillage at both place . The flux wa 1.5- to 2.5-fold greater with tilled than with non-tilled treatment following heavy rain or irrigation in North Dakota and 1.5- to 2.0-fold greater with crop than with fallow following substantial rain in Montana . Nitrogen fertilization increased CO2 flux by 14 % compared with no N fertilization in North Dakota and cropping increased the flux by 79 % compared with fallow in no-till and 0 kg N ha ( -1 ) in Montana . The CO2 flux in undisturbed CRP wa similar to that in no-tilled crop . Although soil C content wa not altered , management practice influenced CO2 flux within a short period due to change in soil temperature , water . and nutrient content . Regardless of irrigation , CO2 flux can be reduced from croplands to a level similar to that in CRP planting using no-tilled crop with or without N fertilization compared with other management practice .

aVCarbon dioxide ( CO ( 2 ) ) , one of the major component of greenhouse gas , is of major concern in term of the global warming phenomenon . To mitigate the effect of atmospheric CO ( 2 ) , carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) ha been found to be an important tool . The present study aim at explaining the role of soil a one of the most important natural resource in enhancing CCS . Soils capture and store both organic and inorganic form of carbon and thus act both a source and sink for atmospheric CO ( 2 ) . The datasets developed on CCS of soil permit u to generate thematic map on soil carbon stock , which may serve a ready reckoner for planner in prioritizing C sequestration programme .

aVSoil desiccation usually take place below the depth of soil affected by rainfall infiltration ( about 1-3 m ) with relatively low water content , and is one kind of particular hydrological phenomenon in semi-arid and semi-humid region of the Loess Plateau in China . This desiccation result from the excessive depletion of deep soil water by artificial vegetation and long-term insufficient rainwater supply , which is difficult to disappear with land use change . Due to the influence of global warming during 1950-2000 , large-scale vegetation rehabilitation aggravated water scarcity and led to soil desiccation in the deep soil layer in the Loess Plateau . From southeast to northwest , soil desiccation becomes more intensive with lower water content and bigger range in depth due to drier climate and lower water holding capacity . The range of soil desiccation ha a close relationship with root distribution of plant , and it intensity varies with the type and age of vegetation . The climate drought , soil property and soil water cycle characteristic might be the precondition for the occurrence of soil desiccation , and artificial vegetation with improper type and exorbitant productivity could have accelerated this process in range and intensity . Soil desiccation ha obviously negative effect on water cycle in soil , greatly reduces the anti-drought capacity of plant , and heavily influence the growth and natural succession of vegetation . In order to reduce the range , intensity , and negative effect of soil desiccation , proper type of vegetation should be selected according to rainfall and soil water condition , and the control of vegetation density and productivity should be considered together with soil-water conservation measure .

aVSomali Jet change will influence the variability of Asian monsoon and climate . How would Somali Jet change respond to the global warming in the future climate ? To address this question , we first evaluate the ability of IPCC-AR4 climate model and perform the 20th century climate in coupled model ( 20C3M ) experiment to reproduce the observational feature of the low level Somali Jet in JJA ( June-July-August ) for the period 1976-1999 . Then , we project and discus the change of Somali Jet under the climate change of Scenario A2 ( SRESA2 ) for the period 2005-2099 . The result show that 18 IPCC-AR4 model have performed better in describing the climatological feature of Somali Jet in the present climate simulation . Analysis of Somali Jet intensity change from the multi-model ensemble result for the period 2005-2099 show a weakened Somali Jet in the early 21st century ( 2010-2040 ) , the strongest Somali Jet in the middle 21st century ( 2050-2060 ) , a well a the weakest Somali Jet at the end of the 21st century ( 2070-2090 ) . Compared with the period 1976-1999 , the intensity of Somali Jet is weakening in general , and it becomes the weakest at the end of the 21st century . The result also suggest that the relationship between the intensity of Somali Jet in JJA and the increment of global mean surface air temperature is nonlinear , which is reflected differently among the model , suggesting the uncertainty of the IPCC-AR4 model . Considering the important role of Somali Jet in the Indian monsoon and East Asian monsoon and climate of China , the variability of Somali Jet and it evolvement under the present climate or future climate change need to be further clarified .

aVThis study focus on the management of the local agroecosystems in order to adapt planting or sowing practice for the projected climate change scenario . It is projected that there will be increased air temperature throughout all four season in the coming 100 year , from the southern towards the northern part of Egypt . The objective of this study is to investigate the influence of that increased air temperature on the spatial and temporal distribution of four of the major economic crop in Egypt . The study specie are cotton ( Gossypium barbadense L. , cv . Giza 89 ) , wheat ( Triticum aestivum L. , cv . Gemiza 9 ) , rice ( Oryza stiva L. , cv . Sakha 101 ) and maize ( Zea may L. , cv . Hybrid 10 ) . Optimum air temperature allowing maximum growth for each of the study crop cultivar and the current and projected air temperature pattern in the future year were used for projection of the seasonal and crop distribution map in the year 2005 , 2025 , 2050 , 2075 and 2100 . Results showed that sowing date of a target crop may be managed in order to allow maximum predicted planting area in the same region . The current maximum area suitable for planting the Cotton crop in Egypt ( 104 thousand Fadden/year ; one Fadden = 0.96 hectare or 0.42 acre ) showed few variation over the coming hundred year . In this case , the sowing date should be changed from the hotter month ( February to April ) to the cooler month ( January to February ) . Alternatively , a great reduction in the area planted by Wheat crop wa predicted in the coming 100 year . Despite the early planting , a reduction of about 147 thousand Fadden/year wa projected by the year 2075 . On the other hand , with earlier sowing date , the maximum area that are planted by Rice and Maize may not be greatly affected by the projected increase in air temperature .

aVApproaching the analysis of climate policy from a spatial organization perspective is necessary for realizing both efficient and effective mitigation of greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emission . In particular , it allows assessing the potential contribution of specific mechanism of spatial organization and related spatial planning and policy to climate policy goal . So far , this spatial organization angle of climate policy ha hardly received attention in the literature . The main sector significantly contributing to GHG emission and sensitive to spatial organization and planning is Urban transport . A qualitative evaluation of the available spatial organization policy option is provided , on the basis of four standard 'E criterion ' and a decomposition of CO2 emission . ( C ) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

aV[ 1 ] From 1955 to 2000 , China ha experienced a decrease in the number of frost day , while the length of the frost-free season between the last spring freeze and the first fall frost ha increased . Three distinct regime can be detected in the time series : up to about 1973 , the annual number of frost day wa about 2 d higher than the 1961-1990 average ; from 1973 to 1985 , the annual number of frost day held close to that average with remarkably little interannual variability ; and after 1985 , the annual number of frost day decreased rapidly with distinct reversal around 1992 . The date of first and last frost show two pattern : before 1980 , these date fluctuated around the 1961-1990 average , but after 1980 ( and especially from 1993 ) the frost-free season wa rapidly lengthened . The number of frost day are highly correlated with minimum temperature ( Tmin ) in north China in spring and fall ; while in south China frost date correlate with minimum temperature in winter . Generally , the seasonal relationship between Tmin and frost day are significant in both the temporal and spatial domain when seasonal average Tmin fall within a range of +/- 10 degree C. Analyzing annual and seasonal influence on the number of frost day , we find that water vapor play a significant role . Regionally , the greater influence on the length of the frost-free season in south China ha been the delayed onset of the autumn frost , while in north China the spring and autumn date each have a comparable influence on the length of the frost-free season . The initial lengthening of the frost-free season lagged about 10 year behind the rapid increase in daily minimum temperature , while the decrease in the annual number of frost day lagged by about 15 year .

aVEmpirical Orthogonal Function ( EOF ) analysis and the related Principal Components ( PC ) analysis are used to extract valuable vegetation cover derived information from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA-AVHRR ) 's Leaf Area Index ( LAI ) satellite image . Results suggest that from 1982 to 2000 global climate change ha contributed to an increase in vegetation cover in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau . The correlation between rainfall and LAI EOF PC1 and PC2 indicates that rainfall is the major climatic factor influencing interannual variation of average vegetation cover throughout the entire Plateau . However , annual mean vegetation cover trend in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau are mainly out of phase with air temperature increasing , which is primarily responsible for nonsynchronous change of vegetation cover . In the southern ridge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau , recent warming trend contribute to humid weather and favorable condition for vegetation growth . By contrast , higher temperature have led to arid condition and insufficient rainfall in the northern part of the Plateau , leading to drought and other climatic condition which are not conducive to increased vegetation cover .

aVLand-use change can lead to , change in soil carbon and ( C ) nitrogen ( N ) storage . This study aimed to determine the impact of long-term grazing exclusion , ( GE ) , on soil organic C and total N ( TN ) storage in , the Leymus chinensis grassland of northern China and to estimate the , dynamic of recovery after GE . We investigated the aboveground biomass and soil organic C and TN storage in six contiguous plot along a GE chronosequence comprising free grazing , 3-yr GE , 8-yr GE , 20-yr GE , 24-yr GE , and 28-yr GE , Grazing exclusion for two decade increased the soil C and N storage by 35.7 and 14.6 % , respectively , in the 0- to 40-cm soil layer . The aboveground net primary , productivity and soil C and N storage were the highest with 24-yr GE and the lowest with free grazing . The-storage increased logarithmically with the duration of GE ; after , an initial rapid increase after the introduction of GE , die storage attained equilibrium after 20 yr. A logarithmic regression analysis revealed 86.8 and 87.1 % variation in the soil C storage and 74.2 and 80.7 % variation in the soil N storage in the 0- to 10-cm and 0- to 40-cm soil layer , respectively . Based on these result , we suggest that two decade of GE would restore the L. chinensis grassland from being lightly degraded to a stable productive condition with good soil C and N storage capacity . Our result demonstrated that by implementing GE , the temperate grassland of northern China could facilitate , siginificant C and N storage on decade scale in the context of mitigating global climate change .

aVStrontium isotope stratigraphy of shallow-water carbonate from the southern Apennines ( Italy ) indicates that the late Cenomanian-early Turonian evolution of marine Sr-87/Sr-86 is not accurately depicted by the marine reference curve . Using the low-Mg biotic calcite of well-preserved rudist shell a a study material and carbon isotope stratigraphy for correlation to the standard ammonite biozonal scheme of Northern Europe , new Sr-87/Sr-96 value are proposed for four different stratigraphic level : the middle and uppermost part of the guerangeri zone , the lower and upper part of the geslinianum zone . The southern Apennines data suggest that a sharp positive shift at the onset of oceanic anoxic event 2 precedes the well-known Sr isotope negative shift . The positive shift is interpreted in term of enhanced rate of chemical weathering , driven by global warming forced by volcanogenic CO2 outgassing . A stratified ocean is invoked to reconcile the high gradient and the short lag time of the perturbation with estimate of present-day total mass and residence time of strontium in the ocean . The sharp switch to the negative shift is related to the collapse of water-column density gradient , driven by thermal instability during a late Cenomanian cool event . More active ocean circulation suddenly delivered to surface water the signal of increased submarine volcanism that had accumulated in deep water . ( c ) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All right reserved .

aVBased on two kind of remote sensing data ( snow depth of Special Sensor Microwave/Imager SSM/I from 1993 to 2004 , snow cover of NOAA/AVHRR from 1996 to 2004 ) and snow depth and snow cover day of six station over northern Tibet from 1966 to 2003 , we studied snow cover distribution in temporal and spatial scale , and analyzed the influencing factor of snow in Northern Tibet region . The result showed that the remote sensing snow data ( retrieval from SSM/I , NOAA/AVHRR ) wa in general agreement with the weather station data . In temporal scale , for the seasonal cycle , during 1966 to 2003 , the snow cover extent increased rapidly in autumn and winter season in Northern Tibet . However , in spring ( March-April-May ) , snow cover extent did not show a continual decrease , whereas indicated a positive feedback . For the interannual cycle , from the end of 1960s the snow cover of Northern Tibet region reduced , but in 1980s , the snow cover increased a a whole , and from 1990s it decreased again . Thus , the snow cover variation showed a reducing-increasing-reducing dynamic process in the study area . The result of a wavelet analysis on temporal distribution of annual cumulative snow cover indicated that there were mainly oscillation period of quasi-2 similar to 3 yr , quasi-9 yr , quasi-13 yr , and from the beginning of 1970s to the middle of 1990s , there wa an oscillation period about quasi-5 yr . In spatial scale , the east part of Northern Tibet region wa the main snow cover area , where the snow cover day exceeded 15 ten-days in each winter-spring , and were obviously distinguished from the western part of Northern Tibet region . The majority of snow cover pixel exist in altitude of 4900 similar to 5600 m. The greatest variance of snow cover wa found in middle and eastern part of the Northern Tibet Plateau , i.e . Andu and Nierong region . We selected two important factor influencing snow-cover i.e. , temperature , precipitation ) and calculated multiple linear regression . The result showed that the correlation coefficient between simulated annual cumulative snow day and observation data wa 0.74 . It revealed that temperature and precipitation are the main factor influencing the snow cover in Northern Tibet region . Global warming might be one reason causing snow cover declining in recent year in Northern Tibet region . However , the effect of precipitation seems larger than that of temperature .

aVTemperature is important to fish in determining their geographic distribution . For cool- and cold-water fish , thermal regime are especially critical at the southern end of a specie ' range . Although temperature is an easy variable to measure , biological interpretation is difficult . Thus , how to determine what temperature are meaningful to fish in the field is a challenge . Herein , we used the Connecticut River a a model system and Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar ) a a model specie with which to ass the effect of summer temperature on the density of age 0 parr . Specifically , we asked : ( 1 ) What are the spatial and temporal temperature pattern in the Connecticut River during summer ? ( 2 ) What metric might detect effect of high temperature ? and ( 3 ) How is temperature variability related to density of Atlantic salmon during their first summer ? Although the most southern site wa the warmest , some northern site were also warm , and some southern site were moderately cool . This suggests localized , within basin variation in temperature . Daily and hourly mean showed extreme value not apparent in the seasonal mean . We observed significant relationship between age 0 parr density and day at potentially stressful , warm temperature ( > = 23 degree C ) . Based on these result , we propose that useful field reference point need to incorporate the synergistic effect of other stressor that fish encounter in the field a well a the complexity associated with cycling temperature and thermal refuge . Understanding the effect of temperature may aid conservation effort for Atlantic salmon in the Connecticut River and other North Atlantic system .

aVAn inevitable consequence of global climate change is that altered pattern of temperature and precipitation threaten agriculture in marry tropical region , requiring strategy of human adaptation . Moreover , the process of management intensification in agriculture ha increased and may exacerbate vulnerability to climate extreme . Although many solution have been presented , the role of simple agroecological and agroforestry management ha been largely ignored . Some recent literature ha shown how sustainable management may improve agroecological resistance to extreme climate event . We comment specifically on a prevalent form of agriculture throughout Latin America , the coffee agroforestry system . Results from the coffee literature have shown that shade management in coffee system may mitigate the effect of extreme temperature and precipitation , thereby reducing the ecological and economic vulnerability of many rural farmer . We conclude that more traditional form of agriculture can offer greater potential for adapting to changing condition than do current intensive system .

aVThe distribution and intensity of transmission of vector-borne pathogen can be strongly influenced by the competence of vector . Vector competence , in turn , can be influenced by temperature and viral genetics . West Nile virus ( WNV ) wa introduced into the United States of America in 1999 and subsequently spread throughout much of the Americas . Previously , we have shown that a novel genotype of WNV , WN02 , first detected in 2001 , spread across the US and wa more efficient than the introduced genotype , NY99 , at infecting , disseminating , and being transmitted by Culex mosquito . In the current study , we determined the relationship between temperature and time since feeding on the probability of transmitting each genotype of WNV . We found that the advantage of the WN02 genotype increase with the product of time and temperature . Thus , warmer temperature would have facilitated the invasion of the WN02 genotype . In addition , we found that transmission of WNV accelerated sharply with increasing temperature , T , ( best fit by a function of T ( 4 ) ) showing that traditional degree-day model underestimate the impact of temperature on WNV transmission . This laboratory study suggests that both viral evolution and temperature help shape the distribution and intensity of transmission of WNV , and provides a model for predicting the impact of temperature and global warming on WNV transmission .

aVThe white-beaked dolphin ( Lagenorhynchus albirostris ) and short-beaked common dolphin ( Delphinus delphi ) are two of the most abundant delphinid specie in shelf water around the United Kingdom ( UK ) and Republic of Ireland ( ROI ) in the summer season ( May-October ) . As these two specie have similar habitat preference and diet , it might be expected that they would partition their otherwise shared niche to reduce the potential for competition at this time of year . This study used 569 sighting of the two specie , collected from shelf water ( < 200 m water depth ) in the summer season between 1983 and 1998 , to investigate whether there is evidence of widespread niche partitioning based on water temperature in this area . Below 13 degree C , white-beaked dolphin were dominant with 96 % of sighting comprising this specie . In contrast , above 14 degree C , 86 % of sighting comprised common dolphin . A classification tree analysis found that of the four eco-geographical variable analysed ( water depth , seabed slope , seabed aspect and sea surface temperature ) , temperature wa the most important variable for separating the occurrence of the two specie . These result are consistent with widespread temperature-based niche partitioning between white-beaked and common dolphin in shelf water around the UK and ROI . As temperature is important in determining the relative distribution of these specie , the range of the white-beaked dolphin might be expected to contract in response to increasing sea temperature resulting from global climate change , while that of the common dolphin may expand .

aVThe lack of proper wastewater treatment result in production Of CO2 and CH4 without the opportunity for carbon sequestration and energy recovery , with deleterious effect for global warming . Without extending wastewater treatment to all urban area worldwide , CO2 and CH4 emission associated with wastewater discharge could reach the equivalent of 1.91 X 10 ( 5 ) t ( CO2 ) d ( -1 ) in 2025 , with even more dramatic impact in the short-term . The carbon sequestration benefit of wastewater treatment have enormous potential , which add an energy conservation incentive to upgrading existing facility to complete wastewater treatment . The potential greenhouse gas discharge which can be converted to a net equivalent CO2 credit can be a large a 1.21 x 10 ( 4 ) t ( CO2 ) d ( -1 ) by 2025 . Biomass sequestration and biogas conversion energy recovery are the two main strategy for carbon sequestration and emission offset , respectively . The greatest potential for improvement is outside Europe and North America , which have largely completed treatment plant construction . Europe and North America can partially offset their CO2 emission and receive benefit through the carbon emission trading system , a established by the Kyoto protocol , by extending existing technology or subsidizing wastewater treatment plant construction in urban area lacking treatment . This strategy can help mitigate global warming , in addition to providing a sustainable solution for extending the health , environmental , and humanitarian benefit of proper sanitation .

aVBackground A rarely investigated consequence of heat exposure is renal dysfunction resulting from dehydration and hyperthermia . Our study aim to quantify the relationship between exposure to extreme high temperature and renal morbidity in South Australia . Methods Poisson regression accounting for over dispersion , seasonality and long-term trend wa used to estimate the effect of heat wave on hospital admission for renal disease , acute renal failure and renal dialysis over a 12-year period . Selected comorbidities were investigated a possible contributing risk factor . Results Admissions for renal disease and acute renal failure were increased during heat wave compared with non-heat wave period with an incidence rate ratio of 1.100 [ 95 confidence interval ( CI ) 1.0031.206 ] and 1.255 ( 95 CI 1.0371.519 ) , respectively . Hospitalizations for dialysis showed no corresponding increase . Comorbid diabetes did not increase the risk of renal admission , however effect of heat and light and exposure to excessive natural heat ( collectively termed effect of heat ) were identified a risk factor . Conclusion Our finding suggest that a heat wave become more frequent , the burden of renal morbidity may increase in susceptible individual a an indirect consequence of global warming .

aVPeat bog play a large role in the global sequestration of C , and are often dominated by different Sphagnum specie . Therefore , it is crucial to understand how Sphagnum vegetation in peat bog will respond to global warming . We performed a greenhouse experiment to study the effect of four temperature treatment ( 11.2 , 14.7 , 18.0 and 21.4 degree C ) on the growth of four Sphagnum specie : S. fuscum and S. balticum from a site in northern Sweden and S. magellanicum and S. cuspidatum from a site in southern Sweden . In addition , three combination of these specie were made to study the effect of temperature on competition . We found that all specie increased their height increment and biomass production with an increase in temperature , while bulk density were lower at higher temperature . The hollow specie S. cuspidatum wa the least responsive specie , whereas the hummock specie S. fuscum increased biomass production 13-fold from the lowest to the highest temperature treatment in monoculture . Nutrient concentration were higher at higher temperature , especially N concentration of S. fuscum and S. balticum increased compared to field value . Competition between S. cuspidatum and S. magellanicum wa not influenced by temperature . The mixture of S. balticum with S. fuscum and S. balticum with S. magellanicum showed that S. balticum wa the stronger competitor , but it lost competitive advantage in the highest temperature treatment . These finding suggest that specie abundance will shift in response to global warming , particularly at northern site where hollow specie will lose competitive strength relative to hummock specie and southern specie .

aVThere is a profound debate over how to assign greenhouse gas ( GHG ) responsibility ; therefore , we have decided to follow IPCC guideline , a they offer the only standardized method . We have identified each type of greenhouse emission and it level of absorption . We have studied the province and it district and municipality . We have determined that the energy sector is that with the highest level of emission , even if the per caput emission of the Province of Siena are very low . This is caused by a very low level of industrialization and the presence of a local geothermal production of energy . In order to highlight this aspect , we have considered scenario both with and without geothermal production . Our research wa then focused on single district ( group of homogenous municipality ) and municipality , where we found great difference among the greenhouse emission of the area . We have constructed a map of the greenhouse emission of the whole province . It ha been interesting to note that there are 14 municipality with net negative emission , seven with low positive emission , 12 with medium positive emission and three with elevated positive emission . These latter correspond to the main city and to two of the most industrialized municipality . ( c ) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVContinually increasing amount of municipal solid waste ( MSW ) and the limited capacity of the existing waste management system in Phuket have led to the consideration of integrated waste management system ( IWMS ) . Life cycle assessment ( LCA ) wa employed to compare the greenhouse gas emission expressed a global warming potential ( GWP ) of the existing waste management system ( the base scenario ) and other three IWMSs for Phuket MSW . Besides incineration and landfilling , the proposed scenario include 30 % source separation for recycling ( scenario 2 ) , anaerobic digestion ( scenario 3 ) and both ( scenario 4 ) . The functional unit is set a 1 t of Phuket MSW treated . Results from the impact assessment of the base scenario show that the net GWP is 1006 kg CO2 equivalent . Landfilling contributes to the highest potential of this impact . The result from a holistic comparison show that scenario 4 is the best option among all the scenario , contributing GWP of 415 kg CO2 eq. , whereas the base scenario is the worst . The emission of greenhouse gas from landfilling is reduced by the introduction of landfill gas recovery and utilization for electricity production . By assumption , 50 % recovery of landfill gas lead to the GWP reduction around 58 % by total GWP of landfilling and 36 % by the net GWP of the whole system in the base scenario . The study suggests that a policy that promotes source separation should be pursued , preferably combined with the application of landfill gas recovery for electricity . Policy promoting recycling is favorable over anaerobic digestion in the situation that both treatment system could not be established at the same time . The major conclusion from the study is that result from the LCA can support Phuket Municipality for decision-making with respect to planning and optimizing IWMS . It can benefit other municipality or policy maker to apply in their waste management project . ( C ) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVPhysiological process that set an organism 's thermal limit are in part determining recent shift in biogeographic distribution range due to global climate change . Several characteristic of the heat-shock response ( HSR ) , such a the onset , maximal , and upper limit of heat-shock protein ( Hsp ) synthesis , contribute to setting the acute upper thermal limit of most organism . Aquatic animal from stable , moderately variable , or highly variable thermal environment differ in their HSR . Some animal living in extremely stable thermal environment lack the response altogether . In contrast , rocky intertidal animal that experience highly variable thermal condition start synthesizing Hsps , that is , the onset of synthesis , below the highest temperature that they experience . Thus , these organism experience thermal condition in their environment that are close to the upper thermal limit in which they can defend themselves against cellular thermal insult by employing the HSR . Subtidal animal are characterized by moderately variable thermal environment , and their cell start synthesizing Hsps above the highest temperature that they experience . The upper thermal limit against which they can defend themselves are thus much higher than the highest body temperature they currently experience . Furthermore , the ability to acclimate to changing thermal condition seems greatest among animal from moderately variable environment and limited in animal from stable and highly variable environment . Thus , these finding suggest that organism with the narrowest ( stenothermal ) and the widest ( highly eurythermal ) temperature tolerance range live closest to their thermal limit and have a limited ability to acclimate , suggesting that they will be most affected by global climate change .

aVUsing dry/wet index series of China during the past 531 year and 1041 year , by defining the dry ( wet ) grade and making running calculation of the appearance time of each dry ( wet ) grade in the original index series , it wa shown that there is a exponential distribution P ( x ) = A * e ( -gamma x ) of the appearance time of each grade with respect to the window size . We defined 1/gamma a the scale factor to characterize the dry ( wet ) durative and used it to analyze the dry ( wet ) durative of north China and the area between Yangtze and Huai river . Results show that the city factor ha the semi-belt wave distribution from north to south , the dry durative in north China is somewhat longer than that between Yangtze and Huai river , the average dry factor of area A , B and C are 1.87 , 1.62 and 1.82 , respectively . The dry ( wet ) durative is rather obvious in those interval in which dry or wet are comparatively concentrated , so the large spatial scale and synchronized extreme dry accident are easier to happen during the end of 12th century , the beginning of 13th century , the beginning of 17th century and the end of 20th century , which verifies the existence of cluster phenomenon in the dry/wet index . The influence to dry durative in north China caused by the dry/wet index during 1260-1280 ( the climate back ground being the end of the middle age warm ) wa much lavger than that caused by the index during 1980-2000 ( the climate background being the global warming ) . Furthermore , the number of dry year during 1260-1280 wa also larger than that of 1980-2000 . Obviously , serious , larger spatial scale and synchronized extreme dry accident are easy to happen in warm period , and the drought since 1970s in north China might be caused by co-operation of human and natural factor , in which the natural factor might have played the more important role .

aVAccumulating evidence point to an anthropogenic 'fingerprint ' on the global climate change that ha occurred in the last century . Climate change ha , and will continue to have , profound effect on the structure and function of terrestrial ecosystem . As such , there is a critical need to continue to develop a sound scientific basis for national and international policy regulating carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emission . This paper reflects on the nature of current global change experiment , and provides recommendation for a unified multidisciplinary approach to future research in this dynamic field . These recommendation include : ( 1 ) better integration between experiment and model , and amongst experimental , monitoring , and space-for-time study ; ( 2 ) stable and increased support for long-term study and multi-factor experiment ; ( 3 ) explicit inclusion of biodiversity , disturbance , and extreme event in experiment and model ; ( 4 ) consideration of timing v intensity of global change factor in experiment and model ; ( 5 ) evaluation of potential threshold or ecosystem 'tipping point ' ; and ( 6 ) increased support for model-model and model-experiment comparison . These recommendation , which reflect discussion within the TERACC international network of global change scientist , will facilitate the unraveling of the complex direct and indirect effect of global climate change on terrestrial ecosystem and their component .

aVBetween 1900 and 1955 the average rate of global energy use rose from about 1 TW to 2 TW . Between 1955 and 1999 energy use rose from 2 TW to about 12 TW , and to 2006 a further 16 % growth in primary energy use wa recorded world-wide . There are recommendation by the UK Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution , subsequently supported by others in the UK , that we need to reduce CO2 emission by over 50 % in order to stabilise their impact on global warming ( CO2 being the principal gas believed to be contributing to this phenomenon ) . One way in which we can address this is by judicious use of process intensification technology . Process intensification may be defined a : `` Any engineering development that lead to a substantially smaller , cleaner , safer and more energy-efficient technology . '' It is most often characterised by a huge reduction in plant volume - order of magnitude - but it contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emission may also be significant . Potential energy saving due to investment in process intensification were studied by several UK organisation in the mid 1990s , to assist the UK Government in formulating a strategy on intensification . It is relevant to the theme of the PRES 07 Conference that process integration feature in these analysis . Overall plant intensification in the UK wa identified a having a technical potential of 40 PJ/year ( about 1 million tonne of oil equivalent/annum ) . The total potential energy saving due to investment in process intensification in a range of process unit operation were predicted to be over 74 PJ/year ( 1 PJ = 10 ( 15 ) J ) . Projections for The Netherlands suggest that saving of 50-100 PJ/year should be achieved across chemical and food processing by 2050 . Substantial benefit to industry in the USA are highlighted by US Department of Energy study . This paper relates by discussion and example process intensification to the main theme of the PRES 07 Conference , including process integration . It also identifies the challenge that process intensification is meeting across a range of sector of industry and commerce , in particular a they relate to greenhouse gas control . By highlighting here the main mechanism that 'enhance ' heat and mass transfer in intensified plant , the reader may be stimulated to examine his/her current inefficient process .

aVThe dominant interannual El Nino-Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) phenomenon and the short length of climate observation record make it difficult to study long-term climate variation in the spatiotemporal domain . Based on the fact that the ENSO signal spread to remote region and induces delayed climate variation through atmospheric teleconnections , an ENSO-removal method is developed through which the ENSO signal can be approximately removed at the grid box level from the spatiotemporal field of a climate parameter . After this signal is removed , long-term climate variation are isolated at mid-and low latitude in the climate parameter field from observed and reanalysis datasets . This paper address the long-term global warming trend ( GW ) ; a companion paper concentrate on Pacific pan-decadal variability ( PDV ) . The warming that occurs in the Pacific basin ( approximately 0.4 K in the twentieth century ) is much weaker than in surrounding region and the other two ocean basin ( approximately 0.8 K ) . The modest warming in the Pacific basin is likely due to it dynamic nature on the interannual and decadal time scale and/ or the leakage of upper ocean water through the Indonesian Throughflow . Based on the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research ( NCEP-NCAR ) and the 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ( ECMWF ) Re-Analysis ( ERA-40 ) , a comprehensive atmospheric structure associated with the GW trend is given . Significant discrepancy exist between the two datasets , especially in the tightly coupled dynamic and water vapor field . The dynamic field based on NCEP-NCAR , which show a change in the Walker Circulation , are consistent with the GW change in the surface temperature field . However , intensification in the Hadley Circulation is associated with GW trend in ERA-40 instead .

aVGlobal warming and the loss of sea ice threaten to alter pattern of productivity in arctic marine ecosystem because of a likely decline in primary productivity by sea ice algae . Estimates of the contribution of ice algae to total primary production range widely , from just 3 to > 50 % , and the importance of ice algae to higher trophic level remains unknown . To help answer this question , we investigated a novel approach to food web study by combining the two established method of stable isotope analysis and fatty acid ( FA ) analysis-we determined the C isotopic composition of individual diatom FA and traced these biomarkers in consumer . Samples were collected near Barrow , Alaska and included ice algae , pelagic phytoplankton , zooplankton , fish , seabird , pinniped and cetacean . Ice algae and pelagic phytoplankton had distinctive overall FA signature and clear difference in delta ( 13 ) C for two specific diatom FA biomarkers : 16:4n-1 ( -24.0 +/- 2.4 and -30.7 +/- 0.8 part per thousand , respectively ) and 20:5n-3 ( -18.3 +/- 2.0 and -26.9 +/- 0.7 part per thousand , respectively ) . Nearly all delta ( 13 ) C value of these two FA in consumer fell between the two stable isotopic end member . A mass balance equation indicated that FA material derived from ice algae , compared to pelagic diatom , averaged 71 % ( 44-107 % ) in consumer based on delta ( 13 ) C value of 16:4n-1 , but only 24 % ( 0-61 % ) based on 20:5n-3 . Our estimate derived from 16:4n-1 , which is produced only by diatom , probably best represented the contribution of ice algae relative to pelagic diatom . However , many type of algae produce 20:5n-3 , so the lower value derived from it likely represented a more realistic estimate of the proportion of ice algae material relative to all other type of phytoplankton . These preliminary result demonstrate the potential value of compound-specific isotope analysis of marine lipid to trace C flow through marine food web and provide a foundation for future work .

aVThis paper estimate the difference in stand biomass due to shorter and lighter tree in southwest ( SW ) and southern Amazonia ( SA ) compared to tree in dense forest in central Amazonia ( CA ) . Forest biomass value used to estimate carbon emission from deforestation throughout , Brazilian Amazonia will be affected by any difference between CA forest and those in the `` arc of deforestation '' where clearing activity is concentrated along the southern edge of the Amazon forest . At 12 site ( in the Brazilian state of Amazonas , Acre , Mato Grosso and Para ) 763 tree were felled and measurement were made of total height and of stem diameter . In CA dense forest , tree are taller at any given diameter than those in SW bamboo-dominated open , SW bamboo-free dense forest and SA open forest . Compared to CA , the three forest type in the arc of deforestation occur on more fertile soil , experience a longer dry season and/or are disturbed by climbing bamboo that cause frequent crown damage . Observed relationship between diameter and height were consistent with the argument that allometric scaling exponent vary in forest on different substrate or with different level of natural disturbance . Using biomass equation based only on diameter , the reduction in stand biomass due to shorter tree height alone were 11.0 , 6.2 and 3.6 % , respectively , in the three forest type in the arc of deforestation . A prior study had shown these forest type to have le dense wood than CA dense forest . When tree height and wood density effect were considered jointly , total downward correction to estimate of stand biomass were 39 , 22 and 16 % , respectively . Downward correction to biomass in these forest were 76 Mg ha ( -1 ) ( similar to 21.5 Mg ha ( -1 ) from the height effect alone ) , 65 Mg ha ( -1 ) ( 18.5 Mg ha ( -1 ) from height ) , and 45 Mg. ha ( -1 ) ( 10.3 Mg ha ( -1 ) from height ) . Hence , biomass stock and carbon emission are overestimated when allometric relationship from dense forest are applied to SW or SA forest type . Biomass and emission estimate in Brazil 's National Communication under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change require downward correction for both wood density and tree height .

aVLong-time series of high-resolution temperature record from Chinese Loess Plateau is rare . An April-September mean temperature reconstruction ( 1826-2004 ) ha been developed for the north-central Shaanxi Province , China , based on tree-ring width analysis . The reconstruction capture 39.3 % ( p < 0.001 ) of the variance in the instrumental data over the calibration period from 1951 to 2002 . The reconstruction show a high temperature period of 1928-1933 , which coincides with the timing of the extreme drought event in 1920s in the entire northern China . The two low temperature period in reconstruction are 1883-1888 and 1938-1942 . With the global warming , the April-September mean temperature in study area ha also increased since the 1970s , but ha not exceeded the temperature in 1928-1933 . Besides the statistical analysis , the reconstruction is also verified by the local dryness/wetness index and other dendroclimatological result .

aVRecent mortality outbreak ill marine ecosystem have been linked to elevated seawater temperature associated with global climate change . Acquisition of thermotolerance data is essential , not only to determine the role of temperature in mortality outbreak , but also to predict consequence of global warming . In the NW Mediterranean region , elevated seawater temperature during the summer period of 1999 and 2003 caused mass mortality of the Mediterranean red coral , Corallium rubum ( L. 1758 ) . Experiments testing the upper thermal limit of this specie were carried out in aquarium using sample collected from population front I I to 40 m depth in the Marseilles region ( NW Mediterranean , France ) . Samples were subjected to temperature treatment between 18 and 30 degree C with an exposure time of 5 and 25 day . Three biological response variable were used to evaluate effect of the treatment : coenenchyme necrosis , polyp activity and calcification rate ( Ca-45 incorporation ill calcareous skeleton ) . The result showed that exposure to 24 degree C for 24 day caused a beginning of mortality only for the deep population , and to 25 degree C for between 9 and 14 day caused mass mortality of both sample group . The response variable result indicate that sample from the shallow population had greater thermotolerance of elevated seawater temperature than the deep sample . The shallow sample showed greater polyp activity and higher calcification rate with a delayed necrosis response than the deep sample . These initial thermotolerance result combined with both hydrographic model and seawater temperature monitoring are the first step towards developing predictive tool for anticipating future effect of climate change in the red coral population .

aVConcentration of greenhouse gas play major role in raising the earth 's temperature . Carbon dioxide , produced from burning of fossil fuel , is the principle greenhouse gas and effort are being made at international level to reduce it emission through adoption of energy-efficient technology . The UN Conference on Environment and Development , 1992 made a significant development in this field by initiating the discussion on sustainable development under the Agenda 21 . Cost-effective construction technology can bring down the embodied energy level associated with production of building material by lowering use of energy-consuming material . This embodied energy is a crucial factor for sustainable construction practice and effective reduction of the same would contribute in mitigating global warming . The cost-effective construction technology would emerge a the most acceptable case of sustainable technology in India both in term of cost and environment .

aVPromotion of public transport usage and discouraging the use of car and other private transport improves the environment ( i.e . safety , exhaust emission , noise ) and contributes to reduce the problem of global warming . This paper suggests a new cost-effective idea to locate a vehicle in public transport domain and compare proposed technique to some of the method advised previously to find the location of a vehicle . This paper further proposes a framework that is inspired by the thematic layer of a GIS ( Geographic Information System ) . Proposed transportation GIS work a a visualization tool and help to process spatio-temporal query . Building such a system will first of all require a strategy to keep track of vehicle in specific public transport , a client interface , and a query processing system to handle spatial and temporal query put up by the user of the transport system .

aVIn the companion paper ( Part I ) , we presented a model of permafrost carbon cycle to study the sensitivity of frozen carbon stock to future climate warming . The mobilization of deep carbon stock of the frozen Pleistocene soil in the case of rapid stepwise increase of atmospheric temperature wa considered . In this work , we adapted the model to be used also for floodplain tundra site and to account for the process in the soil active layer . The new process taken into account are litter input and decomposition , plant-mediated transport of methane , and leaching of exudate from plant root . The SRES-A2 transient climate warming scenario of the IPSL CM4 climate model is used to study the carbon flux from the carbon-rich Pleistocene soil with seasonal active-layer carbon cycling on top of it . For a point to the southwest from the western branch of Yedoma Ice Complex , where the climate warming is strong enough to trigger self-sustainable decomposition process , about 256 kgC m ( -2 ) , or 70 % of the initial soil carbon stock under present-day climate condition , are emitted to the atmosphere in about 120 yr , including 20 kgC m ( -2 ) released a methane . The total average flux of CO ( 2 ) and methane emission to the atmosphere during this time is of 2.1 kgC m ( -2 ) yr ( -1 ) . Within the Yedoma , whose most part of the territory remains relatively cold , the emission are much smaller : 0.2 kgC m ( -2 ) yr ( -1 ) between 2050 and 2100 for Yakutsk area . In a test case with saturated upper-soil meter , when the runoff is insufficient to evacuate the meltwater , 0.05 kgCH ( 4 ) m ( -2 ) yr ( -1 ) on average are emitted a methane during 250 yr starting from 2050 . The latter can translate to the upper bound of 1 GtC yr ( -1 ) in CO ( 2 ) equivalent from the 1 million km ( 2 ) area of the Yedoma .

aVArchived scale and otoliths constitute a unique source of DNA that potentially enables extension of the temporal scale of genetic study of fish population by decade and even century . We review recent insight into fish population and conservation genetics obtained using analysis of DNA from archived sample . This involves both new knowledge about demographic parameter and population structure in wild population and insight into consequence of anthropogenic pressure resulting from over-harvesting , habitat degradation and stocking . We show that the latter category of study have led to significant change of management practice . Ongoing improvement of genetic method will undoubtedly further expand the ability to utilize historical DNA sample . We envisage that temporal comparison of large number of coding gene will lead to novel insight into selective response of fish population to anthropogenic challenge , particularly fisheries-induced selection and global warming . However , both acquisition and storage of historical DNA sample can be hurdle to temporal genetic analysis , while degradation and low copy number in historical DNA sample render genetic data from such source prone to technical artefact . We summarize recommendation for storage of sample and DNA extraction and provide checklist for validation of genotyping result . Finally , we stress that validation procedure also involve documentation of the time and population of origin of historical sample , and the inference drawn should account for the technical and statistical uncertainty associated with historical DNA analysis .

aVAlthough result have been controversial , understanding the tropical Pacific climatic state during the Pliocene warm interval ( c. 4.5-3.0 Ma ) is crucial if insight is to be gained into the dynamic process of present and future global warming . In the multi-proxy effort to reconstruct ancient climate , a critical role can be played by palaeoclimatic evidence provided by the spatial and temporal distribution of temperature-sensitive marine mollusc . Shallow-water stratum of the Mejillones Peninsula , northern Chile ( 23 degree S ) , contain dense faunal assemblage in which mollusc exclusive to , or characteristic of , Pliocene deposit ( Chlamys simpsoni , Chlamys vidali , Chorus blainvillei , Concholepas nodosa , Fusinus remondi , Herminespina mirabilis ) coexist with surprisingly abundant and varied population of extant warm-water specie ( Bulla punctulata , Cerithium stercusmuscarum , Olivella sp.. Turbo cf . fluctuosus , Anomia peruviana , Argopecten ventricosus , Donax peruvianus , Dosinia ponderosa , Mexicardia procera , Undulostera megodon ) , most of which have their current southern zoogeographical limit at 6 degree S. These tropical element are reliable indicator of nearshore marine condition and their abundant occurrence implies that sea surface temperature ( SST ) along the northern Chile coast were at least 2 degree C warmer in the mid-Pliocene than at present , and that these very different condition lasted long enough to allow stable colonization of the area . Such a significantly warmer SST pattern strongly resembles general climatic condition accompanying modern El Nino event , when warm tropical water propagate southward along the western margin of South America ; this support the existence in this area of persistently El Nino-like condition during the mid-Pliocene .

aVTemporal advancement of resource availability by warming in seasonal environment can reduce reproductive success of vertebrate if their own reproductive phenology doe not also advance with warming . Indirect evidence from large-scale analysis suggests , however , that migratory vertebrate might compensate for this by tracking phenological variation across landscape . Results from our two-year warming experiment combined with seven year of observation of plant phenology and offspring production by caribou ( Rangifer tarandus ) in Greenland , however , contradict evidence from large-scale analysis . At spatial scale relevant to the foraging horizon of individual herbivore , spatial variability in plant phenology wa reduced-not increased-by both experimental and observed warming . Concurrently , offspring production by female caribou declined with reduction in spatial variability in plant phenology . By highlighting the spatial dimension of trophic mismatch , these result reveal heretofore unexpected adverse consequence of climatic warming for herbivore population ecology .

aVEnvironmental estrogen have the potential to considerably affect the reproduction and development of aquatic vertebrate by interfering with the endocrine system . In addition to the potential risk of environmental estrogen , increasing water temperature a a result of global warming have become a serious problem in many river and stream . To ass the degree of estrogenic exposure , the analysis of the estrogen-dependent protein vitellogenin ( Vtg ) is a frequently used biomarker in field study . Little , however , is known regarding the potential interaction between ambient water temperature and the Vtg production induced by waterborne environmental estrogen . In order to test the influence of temperature on Vtg synthesis , we exposed juvenile brown trout to an environmentally relevant concentration of ethinylestradiol ( EE ( 2 ) ) and held them either at low or high temperature ( 12 and 19 degree C , respectively ) , but also at temperature cycle of 12-19 degree C in order to simulate the field situation . The EE ( 2 ) exposure caused a 7-74-fold increase of hepatic Vtg mRNA . The synthesis of Vtg mRNA wa clearly stimulated in fish held at higher water temperature ( 12-19 degree C and 19 degree C , respectively ) . On the protein level , Vtg showed a similar pattern ; the higher the temperature , the higher the concentration of Vtg in the plasma . The experiment further revealed a temperature-dependent increasing amount of hepatic estrogen receptor alpha mRNA ( ER alpha ) after exposure to waterborne EE ( 2 ) . The gene expression of estrogen receptor beta-1 ( ER beta-1 ) and the glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) in the liver of EE ( 2 ) exposed fish , however , showed no treatment-related alteration . In line with observed constant bile cortisol concentration , our data do not indicate corresponding stress related effect on hepatic Vtg production . The present survey , however , clearly demonstrates that increased temperature significantly elevates the estrogen-induced expression of Vtg and therefore ha to be considered when interpreting environmental monitoring study .

aVIn a global warming scenario , drought and heat wave like the one that occurred in 2003 in Europe are expected to become more intense and frequent . This extreme climate event strongly affected the hydraulic balance in many forest tree specie including Douglas-fir , with symptom ranging from partial crown necrosis to death . We studied a French Douglas-fir provenance trial , strongly affected by the 2003 drought and heat wave . Using wood X-ray microdensity profile a a record of cambium response to environmental variation , we compared mean stem density and growth between dead and alive neighbouring tree and several microdensity character measured over 17 growth ring previous to 2003 . Special attention ha been given to the sampling layout in order to minimize the micro-environmental effect . At tree level , surviving tree have a significantly higher mean stem density . At tree ring level , they have a significantly higher mean ring density , maximum ring density , latewood density and , to a lesser extent , latewood proportion . No significant difference wa found for diameter growth . These result could have direct implication in the way to study and predict possible acclimation and adaptation of forest tree to climate change process . Wood could be used for the selection of genotype with a desirable plasticity and resistance to drought induced-cavitation . ( c ) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All right reserved .

aVThis article explores how climate change ha recently influenced the Inupiaq Cultural identity a the people of the whale . Their traditional whaling cycle reveals strong indivisibility of music , emotion , and place based human identity . To illustrate such integrity of the Inupiat and their culturally critical bowhead whale ( Balaena mysticetus ) , a search wa made for specific way in which climate change influence Inupiaq spiritual and physical tie with the whale in relation to traditional music making . Traditionally , the Inupiat say that it is the whale who brings them music , thus no whale harvest mean no music production . However , when the environment is le predictable , the homeland eroded , place based song gone , and human-whale integrity threatened , how specifically are these change manifested in the Inupiat-whale relationship ? Providing detailed description of 2005-2006 nalukataq ( midsummer whale feast ) , this article examines how contemporary Inupiat respond to environmental change in the emotional and cultural dimension through their music making .

aVThe stability of the Amazon forest-climate equilibrium is being perturbed by a number of human driver of change ( e.g . deforestation , global warming , forest fire , higher CO ( 2 ) concentration , and increased frequency of drought and flood ) . Quantitative assessment for the maintenance of the tropical forest indicate that 'tipping point ' may exist for total deforested area ( > 40 % ) and for global warming ( Delta T > 3-4 degree C ) . The likelihood of exceeding a tipping point can be greatly exacerbated by increase in forest fire and drought , but quantification of those effect is still lacking . Forest resilience can be significantly increased if CO ( 2 ) 'fertilization ' effect is proven to be taking place for tropical forest , but it can be offset by continued increase in temperature , rainfall seasonality , and forest fire .

aVThe census of vascular plant across a 10-year interval ( 1995-2005 ) at the fringe of a neotropical rainforest ( Nouragues inselberg , French Guiana , South America ) revealed that specie richness decreased , both at quadrat scale ( 2 m ( 2 ) ) and at the scale of the inselberg ( three transects , embracing the whole variation in community composition ) . Juvenile stage of all tree and shrub specie were most severely affected , without any discrimination between life and growth form , fruit and dispersion type , or seed size . Species turnover in time resulted in a net loss of biodiversity , which wa inversely related to specie occurrence . The most probable cause of the observed specie disappearance is global warming , which severely affected northern South America during the last 50 year ( +2 degree C ) , with a concomitant increase in the occurrence of aridity .

aVThis paper deal with a comparative analysis of two different packaging and transport scenario , which exemplifies the implication of choosing between single-use and reusable packaging . In particular , transport of a batch of chemical by mean of disposable fibre drum versus reusable steel drum is investigated from a life cycle perspective , and the associated environmental impact in term of global warming potential , acidification potential , gross energy requirement and solid waste generation is assessed . Results prove beyond reasonable doubt that even in the case of durable packaging container requiring the use of comparatively energy-intensive material for their production , the reuse scenario is characterized by lower environmental impact indicator across the board , and a such is the most advisable and environmentally sound option .

aVOrganic solvent are used in large quantity in the chemical , metal and electronics industry a well a in many consumer product , such a coating or paint , and are therefore among the most important chemical . The petrochemical production of organic solvent is a relevant environmental issue because fossil resource are needed ( crude oil and natural gas ) , synthesis process are energy-intensive and cause considerable amount of emission . So far , comprehensive data on the environmental impact are rather scarce . The aim of this paper is to therefore present a systematical environmental assessment of the main petrochemical solvent production route using the Life Cycle Assessment ( LCA ) method . Fifty organic solvent were selected covering the most important representative from the various chemical group ( e.g. , alcohol , ester , ketone ) . To conduct the LCA , 40 new Life Cycle Inventories ( LCI ) were established and existing LCI were improved . The petrochemical solvent production wa structured into four production route . In these production route , the single chemical unit process ( e.g . esterification , carbonylation or hydrogenation ) were analyzed in order to determine characteristic environmental impact . The four solvent production route including the unit process and intermediate are presented . Additionally , energy profile of these production route are shown using the Cumulative Primary Energy Demand ( CED ) a an indicator for the environmental impact . The result were cross-checked with the Global Warming Potential and the Eco-indicator 99 method and good correlation were found . Processes that show high environmental impact are the dehydration of butylene glycol to tetrahydrofuran , the carbonylation of methanol to methyl formate , the hydrogenation of acetone to methyl isobutyl ketone , and the Reppe synthesis of formaldehyd/acetylene to butylene glycol . Based on the energy profile , range of environmental impact are determined for all unit process . On the one hand , esterification and alkylation process cause high CED value because complex ancillaries are needed and hydroformylation and carbonylation process are energy-intensive . On the other hand , in hydration , hydrogenation , hydrolysis , and oxidation process , ancillaries with low CED are added to the chemical structure that result in low CED range for these unit process . Dehydrogenation and molecular sieve separation process seem to be energy efficient and no ancillaries are required . Therefore , these unit process cause the lowest CED value . Subject of further research in this field should be the environmental analysis of further process step that include the presented unit process and a subsequent statistical analysis in order to derive reliable data range for all unit process . Such statistically robust range could be used in the approximation of missing life-cycle inventory data of other chemical product and intermediate .

aVThe development of material of ultralow high-temperature thermal conductivity for application in high-temperature thermal insulation ha become increasingly more important than ever in view of the ever worsening issue of fossil energy depletion and global warming that call for more demanding energy-saving practice . In this study , a new class of opacified monolithic aerogels of ultralow high-temperature thermal conductivity wa developed for thermal insulation application at high temperature . Carbon nanofibers were successfully incorporated into the mesoporous network of silica aerogels at concentration a high a 20 wt % through an accelerated-gelation sol-gel process to enhance the dimensional stability of the silica aerogels and to suppress the thermal radiation that become dominant at high temperature , to achieve an ultralow thermal conductivity of 0.050 W/m-K at 500 degree C , whereas maintaining a thermal stability above 500 degree C ( much better than the conventional high-temperature thermal insulation material : 0.3 W/m-K at 500 degree C for glass fiber , 0.1 W/m-K at 527 degree C for alumina fused brick , and 1.7 W/m-K at 527 degree C for sillimante ) .

aVThe history of life is written in the ocean , and the history of the ocean is written in DNA . Geologists have shown u that hundred of million of year of ocean history can be revealed from record of a single phylum in core of mud from abyssal plain . We are now accumulating genetic tool to unravel the relationship of hundred of phylum to track this history back billion of year . The technology demonstrated by the Census of Marine Life ( CoML ) mean that the ocean is no longer opaque or unknowable . The secret of the largest component of the biosphere are knowable . The cost of understanding the history of ocean life is not cheap , but it is also not prohibitive . A transparent , open ocean is available for u to use to understand ourselves . This article develops a model of biodiversity equilibration in a single , physically static ocean a a step towards biodiversity in physically complex real ocean . It attempt to be quantitative and to simultaneously account for biodiversity pattern from bacteria to whale focusing on emergent proper-ties rather than detail . Biodiversity reflects long-term survival of DNA sequence , stabilizing `` ecosystem service '' despite environmental change . In the ocean , mechanism for ensuring survival range from prokaryote maintaining low concentration of replicable DNA throughout the ocean volume , anticipating local change , to animal whose mobility increase with mass to avoid local change through movement . Whales can reach any point in the ocean in week , but prokaryote can only diffuse . The high metabolic cost of mobility are offset by the dramatically lower number of DNA replicates required to ensure survival . Reproduction rate probably scale more or le inversely with body mass . Bacteria respond in a week , plankton in a year , whale in a century . We generally lack coherent theory to explain the origin of animal ( metazoan ) and the contribution of biodiversity to ecosystem . The One Ocean Model suggests that mobile metazoan paved the way for their own energetic life style by decreasing the amount of primary production sinking to feed the benthic anaerobic prokaryote . Increasing metazoan mobility and diversity ensured that le and le production sank and accelerated development of the aerobic ocean they require . High biodiversity among middle-sized organism stabilizes the system , but rapid environmental change can decrease diversity in a positive feedback loop ending in mass extinction event and the return of the anaerobe . The ocean have gone through this cycle several time . Global warming may be a mild flu compared to `` the revenge of the microbe '' . ( C ) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVWe report high-precision record of a magnetic reversal event at the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum ( PETM ) , a cataclysmic global warming event initiated at 55.0 Ma . This event is confirmed by both an antipodal shift in direction and a reduction in magnetic intensity during the lower and upper transition , and it is seen at additional site , indicating that the characteristic remanent magnetization ( ChRM ) wa primarily acquired by Earth 's magnetic field during sedimentation . This major fluctuation of Earth 's magnetic field intensity is interpreted to have been linked to the PETM and to have eventually facilitated the reversal . This Paleocene-Eocene magnetic reversal ( PEMR ) lasted for similar to 53 ka , from 54.964 to 54.911 Ma , but finally recovered to an original polarity . This suggests a possible coupling between Earth 's core magnetofluid dynamo sphere and the atmosphere-hydrosphere during an abrupt catastrophic climate event .

aVEnzymes catalyzing ammonium ( NH ( 4 ) ( + ) ) /nitrate ( NO ( 3 ) ( - ) ) into nitrous oxide ( N ( 2 ) O ) /molecular nitrogen ( N ( 2 ) ) , play critical role in water quality management . The objective of this paper wa to investigate the role of extra-cellular enzyme in cycling of nitrogen ( N ) in aquatic system . It appears that N in estuary , salt marsh , etc. , doe not stay long enough to be available for uptake , thus , creating N limited condition . This study showed that indigenous extra-cellular nitrate reductase along with others involved in N transformation in the waters/sediments of estuarine system can cause complete removal of NH ( 4 ) ( + ) and NO ( 3 ) ( - ) from the water and available NH ( 4 ) ( + ) and NO ( 3 ) ( - ) from the sediment . These result indicate that due to high extracellular nitrate reductase and other enzyme associated with N transformation in sediments/waters , substantial amount of NH ( 4 ) ( + ) and NO ( 3 ) ( - ) can be quickly lost from the system a N ( 2 ) O and/or nitric oxide ( NO ) , in turn , creating N limited condition in estuarine system . Such high activity of indigenous nitrate reductase and others are useful in removing readily bioavailable N from the system , thereby avoidance of eutrophic condition . However , they might contribute in increasing the N ( 2 ) O , a potent greenhouse gas with global warming potential ( GWP ) of 296 , in the atmosphere .

aVThe current contribution described the rate-based method for process design of reactive gas-liquid system in view of natural gas processing in energy technology . The focus wa on a new application of reactive absorption associated with CO ( 2 ) capture , especially in a pre-combustion mode . This mode required natural gas processing but offered the possibility of CO ( 2 ) Capture under advantageously high pressure which decreased the operational cost . The presented rate-based method wa based on physical quantity which characterised the process , i.e . first of all specie on the absorption flux a a function of the reactor height without the utilisation of empirical parameter . Therefore , the presented method wa enough general and suitable for describing of any reactive absorption and desorption including the practical system CO ( 2 ) -H ( 2 ) S-amines-water-natural gas . The elementary equation of the method were given in Eqs . ( 1-9 ) . A design approach , which utilized the described rate-based method , allowed precise process design of new purification and processing installation for natural gas and the operative optimization of the existing one . Referring to the discussion from the IX KNT Rynek Gazu 2009 this paper presented the role of CO ( 2 ) in the global warming , it climatic and economic consequence and up-to-date proposal for political , economic , scientific and innovative solution .

For this purpose , change of the climate zone that exist according to Koeppen will be analysed . The trend and outlier in term of expansion and location of individual climate type are used a statistical indicator of climate change . The most important result of this study are : a ) a significant increase of the extension of the climate type BS and Cr ; b ) a significant decrease of the extension of the climate type Dc and Ec ; c ) the largest change are observed within the last two decade . These change are discussed in relation to the mean condition of temperature and precipitation . Moreover , significant correlation between the area extension of climate type and the NAO index could be found .

aVPost combustion carbon dioxide ( CO ( 2 ) ) capture is one of the most commonly adopted technology for reducing industrial CO ( 2 ) emission , which is now an important goal given the widespread concern over global warming . Research on amine-based CO ( 2 ) capture ha mainly focused on improving effectiveness and efficiency of the CO ( 2 ) capture process . Our research work focus on Studying the relationship among the significant parameter influencing CO ( 2 ) production because an enhanced understanding of the intricate relationship among the parameter involved in the process is critical for improving efficiency of the CO ( 2 ) capture process . This paper present a statistical study that explores the relationship among parameter involved in the amine-based post combustion CO ( 2 ) capture process at the International Centre for CO ( 2 ) Capture ( ITC ) located in Regina , Saskatchewan of Canada . A multiple regression technique ha been applied for analysis of data collected at the CO ( 2 ) capture pilot plant at ITC . The parameter have been carefully selected to avoid issue of multicollinearity , and four mathematical model among the key parameter identified have been developed . The model have been tested , and accuracy of the model is found to be satisfactory . The model developed in this study describe part of the CO ( 2 ) capture process and can help to predict performance of the CO ( 2 ) capture process at ITC under different condition . Some result from a preliminary validation process will also be presented . ( C ) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVSustainable management of the world 's land resource is a key to the provision of food for a more affluent global population and progress in other area , such a improved water quality and mitigation of climate change . But the world 's land resource are far too varied in their soil , native and managed vegetation , water resource and climatic norm and extreme to expect that a single , globally comprehensive strategy can be applied to meet such goal . Rather , lesson to guide program aimed at achieving sustainability can be assembled from experience gained in discrete geographic , climatic and edaphic region . One such region is the semiarid to subhumid North American Great Plains ( hereafter NAGP ) , a region that since settlement ha experienced many period of economic boom and many of economic distress . Originally a grassland , it vulnerability to soil erosion , environmental problem associated with the use of chemical fertilizer and pesticide , and the overuse of surface and ground water is typical of other important grassland converted to agriculture in South America and in the European and central Asiatic region of the former Soviet Union . In addition , there is reason to believe that many of these grassland region , most located in continental interior , may be further stressed by climate change caused by rising atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gas . One action that can potentially contribute to climate change mitigation is the production of herbaceous biomass , for which the NAGP region is well suited . This paper review the geography , history and current condition of the NAGP and offer suggestion about how the agriculture , economy and environment of this and similar region around the world can be made more sustainable and able to contribute to a reduction in carbon dioxide ( CO ( 2 ) ) emission and consequent global warming .

aVConsidering the significant issue oil global warming and environmental protection , the energy sector need a long-term policy , by which renewable energy gradually replace conventional fossil fuel . In term of an energy system , the development of renewable energy implies a challenge to existing energy like fossil fuel and nuclear power that have been for decade equipped With Sound infrastructure and regulation . And a transformation of the energy system can not expect any achievement without overcoming considerable opposition from vested interest involved with the fossil fuel technology . Analyses of the `` technological system '' can serve a a guide to explore how the phase-in and phase-out of actor in the energy system , the formation of the network , and the establishment of policy come to work on development potential of each function in the energy system . This article , by taking wind power for example , first investigates into the analytical framework of the technological system to analyze developmental strategy for the wind power evolution in Taiwan . Besides , a comparative analysis is drawn from the development of wind power between Germany and Sweden ( a positive and an unsatisfactory example ) to understand what essential policy maker Should consider for expanding wind power utilization in Taiwan .

aVInformation on the effect of global climate change on trend in global fishery biomass yield ha been limited in spatial and temporal scale . Results are presented of a global study of the impact of sea surface temperature ( SST ) change over the last 25 year on the fishery yield of 63 large marine ecosystem ( LMEs ) that annually produce 80 % of the world 's marine fishery catch . Warming trend were observed in 61 LMEs around the globe . In 18 of the LMEs , rate of SST warming were two to four time faster during the past 25 year than the globally averaged rate of SST warming reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2007 . Effects of warming on fishery biomass yield were greatest in the fast-warming northern Northeast Atlantic LMEs , where increasing trend in fishery biomass yield were related to zooplankton biomass increase . In contrast , fishery biomass yield of LMEs in the fast-warming , more southerly reach of the Northeast Atlantic were declining in response to decrease in zooplankton abundance . The LMEs around the margin of the Indian Ocean , where SSTs were among the world 's slowest warming , revealed a consistent pattern of fishery biomass increase during the past 25 year , driven principally by human need for food security from fishery resource . As a precautionary approach toward more sustainable fishery utilization , management measure to limit the total allowable catch through a cap-and-sustain approach are suggested for the developing nation recently fishing heavily on resource of the Agulhas Current , Somali Current , Arabian Sea , and Bay of Bengal LMEs .

aVGlobal climate warming may allow 'warm-season ' chickpea ( Cicer arietinum L. ) to be better adapted to the cool , high latitude area of the world . Chickpea ha a strong indeterminacy and continued growth of vegetative tissue during the later part of the reproduction period often delay maturity in high latitude area . This study wa conducted to determine the adaptability of chickpea and evaluate the relative importance of changing environment and optimizing crop management option in affecting crop maturity . Four cultivar were grown on barley and wheat stubble , and on summerfallow using rate of 0 , 28 , 64 , 84 , and 112 kg N ha ( -1 ) of fertilizer with and without Rhizobium inoculant at six environment in Saskatchewan , Canada , during 2004-2006 . Maturity of chickpea ranged from 91 d in 2006 to 136 din 2004 . About 90 % of the variation in maturity wa due to environment , with the remaining variation related to cultivar , seedbed condition , and soil fertility . The cultivar 'Amit ' and 'CDC-Anna ' matured 2-7 d earlier than 'CDC-Frontier ' and 'CDC-Xena ' averaged across diverse environment . Under cool and wet environment , chickpea grown on cereal stubble matured 7-15 d earlier than those grown on summerfallow ; chickpea grown at moderate rate of N fertilizer ( 28-84 kg ha ( -1 ) ) without Rhizobium inoculant matured 15 d earlier than the crop receiving no-N fertilizer with or without inoculation . Under dry and hot environment , only marginal difference in maturity were observed among applied treatment . Our result indicate that chickpea maturity can be advanced a many a 15 day which can help minimize the risk of crop failure due to immaturity ; this is achievable through the adoption of early-maturing cultivar , use of moderate rate of N fertilizer , and selection of cereal stubble a preferential seedbed . With current genotype of chickpea , there is still considerably high risk of adapting this 'warm-season ' crop in northern high latitude area because of large environmental variability , but this risk might be reduced with continued global warming .

aVFacing the threat of oil depletion and climate change , a shift from fossil resource to renewables is ongoing to secure long-term low carbon energy supply . In view of the carbon dioxide reduction target agreed upon in the Kyoto protocol , bioethanol ha become an attractive option for one energy application , a transport fuel . Many study on the LCA of fuel ethanol have been conducted , and the result vary to a large extent . In most of these study , only one type of allocation is applied . However , the effect of allocation on outcome is of crucial importance to LCA a a decision supporting tool . This is only addressed in a few study to a limited extent . Moreover , most of the study mainly focus on fossil energy use and GHG emission . In this paper , a case study is presented wherein a more complete set of impact category is used . Land use ha been left out of account a only hectare data would be given which is obviously dominated by agriculture . Moreover , different allocation method are applied to ass the sensitivity of the outcome for allocation choice . This study focus on the comparison of LCA result from the application of different allocation method by presenting an LCA of gasoline and ethanol a fuel and with two type of blend of gasoline with ethanol , all used in a midsize car . As a main second-generation application growing fast in the USA , corn stover-based ethanol is chosen a a case study . The life cycle of the fuel include gasoline production , corn and stover agriculture , cellulosic ethanol production , blending ethanol with gasoline to produce E10 ( 10 % of ethanol ) and E85 ( 85 % of ethanol ) , and finally the use of gasoline , E10 , E85 , and ethanol . In this study , a substantially broader set of eight environmental impact is covered . LCA result appear to be largely dependent on the allocation method rendered . The level of abiotic depletion and ozone layer depletion decrease when replacing gasoline by ethanol fuel , irrespective of the allocation method applied , while the rest of the impact except global warming potential are larger . The result show a reduction of global warming potential when mass/energy allocation is applied ; in the case of economic allocation , it give contrary result . In the expanded system , global warming potential is significantly reduced comparing to the one from the allocated system . A contribution analysis show that car driving , electricity use for cellulase enzyme production , and ethanol conversion contribute largely to global warming potential from the life cycle of ethanol fuel . The reason why the result of global warming potential show a reverse trend is that the corn/stover allocation ratio shift from 7.5 to 1.7 when shifting from economic allocation to mass/energy allocation . When mass/energy allocation is applied , both more credit ( CO ( 2 ) uptake ) and more penalty ( N ( 2 ) O emission ) in agriculture are allocated to stover compared to the case of economic allocation . However , more CO ( 2 ) is taken up than N ( 2 ) O ( in CO ( 2 ) eq . ) emitted . Hence , the smaller the allocation ratio is between corn and stover , the lower the share of the overall global warming emission being allocated to ethanol will be . In the system expansion approach , global warming potential are significantly reduced , resulting in the negative value in all case . This implies that the system expansion result are comparable to one another because they make the same cutoff but not really to the result related to mass , energy , and economic value-based allocated system . The choice of the allocation method is essential for the outcome , especially for global warming potential in this case . The application of economic allocation lead to increased GWP when replacing gasoline by ethanol fuel , while reduction of GWP is achieved when mass/energy allocation is used a well a in the system where biogenic CO ( 2 ) is excluded . Ethanol fuel are better option than gasoline when abiotic depletion and ozone layer depletion are concerned . In term of other environmental impact , gasoline is a better option , mainly due to the emission of nutrient and toxic substance connected with agriculture . A clear shift of problem can be detected : saving fossil fuel at the expense of emission related to agriculture , with GHG benefit depending on allocation choice . The overall evaluation of these fuel option , therefore , depends very much on the importance attached to each impact category . This study focus only on corn stover-based ethanol a one case . Further study may include other type of cellulosic feedstock ( i.e. , switchgrass or wood ) , which require le intensive agricultural practice and may lead to better environmental performance of fuel ethanol . Furthermore , this study show that widely used but different allocation method determine outcome of LCA study on biofuels . This is an unacceptable situation from a societal point of view and a challenge from a scientific point of view . The result from applying just one allocation method are not sufficient for decision making . Comparison of different allocation method is certainly of crucial importance . A broader approach beyond LCA for the analysis of biorefinery system with regard to energy conservation , environmental impact , and cost-benefit will provide general indication on the sustainability of bio-based production .

aVIn estimating the climate change impact on coastal region , critical question such a how many people live within one kilometer or below three-meter elevation along the coast are often raised . Surprisingly , answer to these question are not available in the literature . This type of fine-scale estimate of population along the coast is necessary to provide a realistic measure of the population most vulnerable to hurricane and sea-level rise . This paper utilized four published datasets and geographic information system ( GIS ) method to retrieve the answer for the 23 coastal state in the conterminous United States . The result show that about 19 million people reside within one kilometer from the shoreline in the conterminous U.S. , whereas about 11.6 million people live below three-meter elevation . The state-by-state estimate reveal that Florida ha the highest percentage of population living in area below three meter ( 32.5 % ; 5.9 million people ) , followed by Louisiana ( 27.6 % ; 1.2 million people ) . The same methodology can be applied worldwide to estimate the most vulnerable coastal population to global climate change .

aVThe IPCC Fourth Assessment Report ( AR4 ) published in 2007 present the most complete and authoritative assessment of the status of scientific knowledge on all aspect of climate change . This paper present an updated assessment of the risk from anthropogenic climate change , based on a comprehensive review of the pertinent scientific literature published since finalisation of the AR4 . Many risk are now assessed a stronger than in the AR4 , including the risk of large sea-level rise already in the current century , the amplification of global warming due to biological and geological carbon-cycle feedback , a large magnitude of `` committed warming '' currently concealed by a strong aerosol mask , substantial increase in climate variability and extreme weather event , and the risk to marine ecosystem from climate change and ocean acidification . Some topic remain the subject of intense scientific debate , such a past and future change in tropical cyclone activity and the risk of large-scale Amazon forest dieback . The rise in greenhouse gas emission and concentration ha accelerated recently , and it is expected to accelerate further in the absence of targeted policy intervention . Taken together , these finding point to an increased urgency of implementing mitigation policy a well a comprehensive and equitable adaptation policy .

aVAnaerobic digestion ( AD ) of source-separated municipal solid waste ( MSW ) and use of the digestate is presented from a global warming ( GW ) point of view by providing range of greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emission that are useful for calculation of global warming factor ( GWFs ) , i.e . the contribution to GW measured in CO ( 2 ) -equivalents per tonne of wet waste . The GHG accounting wa done by distinguishing between direct contribution at the AD facility and indirect upstream or downstream contribution . GHG accounting for a generic AD facility with either biogas utilization at the facility or upgrading of the gas for vehicle fuel resulted in a GWF from -375 ( a saving ) to 111 ( a load ) kg CO ( 2 ) -eq.tonne ( -1 ) wet waste . In both case the digestate wa used for fertilizer substitution . This large range wa a result of the variation found for a number of key parameter : energy substitution by biogas , N ( 2 ) O-emission from digestate in soil , fugitive emission of CH ( 4 ) , unburned CH ( 4 ) , carbon bound in soil and fertilizer substitution . GWF for a specific type of AD facility wa in the range -95 to -4 kg CO ( 2 ) -eq.tonne ( -1 ) wet waste . The range of uncertainty , especially of fugitive loss of CH ( 4 ) and carbon sequestration highly influenced the result . In comparison with the few published GWFs for AD , the range of our data wa much larger demonstrating the need to use a consistent and robust approach to GHG accounting and simultaneously accept that some key parameter are highly uncertain .

aVTemperature sensitivity of microbial respiration and dissolved organic carbon ( DOC ) production were investigated by using a novel method , thermal gradient ( 2-20A degree C ) temperature bar , in two typical peatlands ( bog and fen ) in North Wales , UK over 12 month . The study indicated that temperature sensitivity of soil organic carbon decomposition in North peatlands wa regulated not only by temperature but soil water content , dry-rewet event and phenologies . Potential decrease of Q ( 10 ) ( CO ( 2 ) ) with increasing soil temperature were confirmed in both peatlands , but Q ( 10 ) ( DOC ) increase with increasing soil temperature in both bog and fen site . These result imply , if other factor such a the so-called CO ( 2 ) fertilization effect are simultaneously taken into account , that the feedback of global warming induced CO ( 2 ) release from peatlands to climate change may be overestimated in current biogeochemical model . However , global warming might have been nonlinearly accelerating DOC thermal production , and therefore it help explaining the cause of remarkable increase of DOC in surface water in the Northern Hemisphere during last several decade .

aVThis work present a novel methodology , genetic programming ( GP ) , for developing environmental response function for Formosan Landlocked Salmon ( Oncorhynchus masou formosanus ) : these function are then applied to evaluate the impact of climate change . Average daily temperature and maximal flow between two sampling period were adopted a principal factor for categorizing environmental condition . The GP successfully identified the response function for various environmental category . The response function were further applied to ass the impact of climate change . Fourteen future possible climate scenario were derived based on the equilibrium and transition experiment by GCMs . Impact assessment result indicated that climate change may significantly influence population of Formosan Landlocked Salmon due to more frequent higher temperature . Adaptation strategy are required to mitigate the impact of global climate change a current conservation measure for Formosan Landlocked Salmon habitat only reduce local human-induced effect . In the situation of complicated relationship between fish population and environmental condition , GP provides a useful tool to obtain some information from the limited data .

aVModels are increasingly used to examine the potential impact of management and climate change in agriculture . Our aim in this paper wa to ass the applicability of the field-DeNitrification DeComposition ( DNDC ) model in Irish agriculture . This study provides the result of that evaluation , which is a prerequisite for using the model for assessing management impact in the future . The DNDC model wa tested against seasonal and annual data set of nitrous oxide flux from a spring barley field and a cut and grazed pasture at the Teagasc Oak Park Research Centre , Co. Carlow , Ireland . In the case of the arable field , predicted flux of N ( 2 ) O agreed well with measured flux for medium to high fertilizer input ( 70-160 kg N ha ( -1 ) ) but poorly described those flux from zero fertilizer treatment . In term of cumulative flux value , the relative deviation of the predicted flux from the measured value wa a maximum of 6 % for the highest N fertilizer input but increased to 30 % for the medium N and more than 100 % for the zero N fertilizer treatment . There is a linear correlation of predicted against measured flux value for all fertilizer treatment ( r ( 2 ) = 0.85 ) but the model underestimated the seasonal flux by 24 % . Incorporation of literature value from a range of different study on arable and pasture land did not significantly improve the regression . The description by DNDC for measured flux of N ( 2 ) O from reduced tillage plot wa poor with underestimation of up to 55 % . For the cut and grazed pasture the relative deviation of predicted to measured flux were 150 and 360 % for fertilized and unfertilized plot . A sensitivity analysis suggests that the poor model fit is due to DNDC overestimating WFPS and the effect of initial soil organic carbon ( SOC ) on N ( 2 ) O flux . As the arable and grassland soil differed only in SOC content , reducing SOC of the grassland field to that of the arable field value significantly improved the fit of the model to measured data such that the relative deviation decreased to 9 and 5 % respectively . Sensitivity analysis highlighted air temperature a the main determinant of N ( 2 ) O flux , an increase in mean daily air temperature of 1.5 degree C resulting in almost a 65 % increase in the annual cumulative flux . This is interesting a with future global warming , N ( 2 ) O flux from the soil will have a strong positive feedback . It can be concluded that DNDC is unsuitable for predicting N ( 2 ) O from Irish grassland due to it overestimation of WFPS and effect of SOC on the flux . ( C ) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

aVArbuscular mycorrhizal fungi ( AMF ) play important role in ecosystem process . However , little is known about AMF abundance in arid , nutrient-poor environment like the Mojave Desert of North America . We conducted two AMF study : one examined AMF response to elevated atmospheric CO ( 2 ) at the Nevada Desert FACE ( Free-Air-Carbon dioxide-Enrichment ) Facility ( NDFF ) , and the second examined seasonal dynamic at nearby site . In both study , AMF measurement ( root colonization , extra-radical hyphal [ ERH ] length , and two measure of glomalin-related soil protein [ GRSP ] ) and environmental factor ( root length , soil water content , and precipitation ) were measured across microsites ( beneath shrub , shrub interspaces ) for two specie ( Larrea tridentata , Ambrosia dumosa ) . Elevated CO ( 2 ) did not significantly affect AMF measurement . Other NDFF study show no change in fine root production under elevated CO ( 2 ) but show increased available nitrogen . We infer that additional fixed carbon under elevated CO ( 2 ) is not allocated to soil resource foraging . However , AMF varied seasonally . ERH seasonally declined across specie and microsites , but GRSP declined only beneath L. tridentata . Our result combined with previous result indicate that drought negatively affect AMF root colonization . Robust inter-relationship among AMF measurement only occurred between the two measure of GRSP , indicating that resource are independently allocated to different AMF structure .

aVA bioclimate model predicting the presence or absence of aspen , Populus tremuloides , in western USA from climate variable wa developed by using the Random Forests classification tree on Forest Inventory data from about 118,000 permanent sample plot . A reasonably parsimonious model used eight predictor to describe aspen 's climate profile . Classification error averaged 4.5 % , most of which were error of commission . The model wa driven primarily by three variable : an annual dryness index , the ratio of summer to annual precipitation , and an interaction of growing season precipitation with the summer-winter temperature differential . Projecting the contemporary climate profile into the future climate provided by three General Circulation Models and two scenario ( SRES A2 and either B1 or B2 ) suggested that the area occupied by the profile should diminish rapidly over the course of the century , 6-41 % by the decade surrounding 2030 , 40-75 % for that surrounding 2060 , and 46-94 % for 2090 . The relevance of the climate profile to understanding climate-based response is illustrated by relating trend in climate to the recent incidence of sudden aspen dieback that ha plagued portion of the aspen distribution . Of the eight variable in the profile , four reached extreme value during 2000-2003 , the period immediately preceding the appearance of damage in aerial survey .

aVThis study investigated a gas chromatographic ( GC ) method to ass the destruction or removal efficiency ( DRE ) of local scrubber on five perfluorocompounds ( PFCs ) , i.e. , SF ( 6 ) , NF ( 3 ) , CF ( 4 ) , C ( 2 ) F ( 6 ) and C ( 3 ) F ( 8 ) , which are very potent greenhouse gas used in a semiconductor fabrication plant . Air sample taken at inlet and outlet of local scrubber were analyzed by a self-constructed multi-column CC system equipped with thermal conductivity detection . Three packed column were integrated into the heart-cut GC system to allow simultaneous analysis of the five target PFCs . The Porapak Q pre-column performs rough separation and cut eluent group to two analytical column for optimal separation . The Molecular Sieve -5A column separated NF ( 3 ) , CF ( 4 ) , and C ( 3 ) F ( 8 ) and the second Porapak Q separated SF ( 6 ) and C ( 2 ) F ( 6 ) . Linearity wa greater than 0.995 ( R ( 2 ) ) for the five PFCs , and the reproducibility wa about 4 % ( relative standard deviation ) for NF ( 3 ) , and better than 0.5 % for the other four PFCs . DRE for the combustion ( CB ) and electric-thermal type of local scrubber wa evaluated by taking into account the in-line dilution from air and fuel gas . Both flow and tracer method were employed to deduce the dilution factor ( DFs ) . For the tracer method , helium wa employed a the tracer and injected upstream of the scrubber and thus mixed with the exhaust gas . With this method , the DFs were determined to be in the range from 4.8 to 5.9 for the CB unit , significantly higher than the value of 3.3 based on the flow method . The DREs for the CB unit for C ( 3 ) F ( 8 ) were greater than 90 % and between 40 % and 50 % for CF ( 4 ) . ( C ) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVLife cycle assessment of bio-based polymer resin and product historically have shown favorable result in term of environmental impact and energy use compared to petroleum-based product . However , calculation of these impact always depends on the system and boundary condition considered during the study . This paper report a cradle-to-cradle Life Cycle Assessment ( LCA ) of poly ( lactic acid ) ( PLA ) in comparison with poly ( ethylene terephthalate ) ( PET ) and poly ( styrene ) ( PS ) thermoformed clamshell container , used for packaging of strawberry with emphasis on different end-of-life scenario . It considers all the input such a fertilizer , pesticide , herbicide and seed corn required for the growing and harvesting of corn used for manufacturing PLA . For PET and PS , the extraction of crude oil and the entire cracking process from crude oil through styrene and ethylene glycol and terephathalic acid are considered . Global warming , aquatic acidification , aquatic eutrophication , aquatic ecotoxicity , ozone depletion , non-renewable energy and respiratory organic , land occupation and respiratory inorganics were the selected midpoint impact category . The geographical scope of the study reflects data from Europe , North America and the Middle East . PET showed the highest overall value for all the impact category , mainly due to the higher weight of the container . The main impact to the environment were the resin production and the transportation stage of the resin and container . This implies that the transportation stage of the package is an important contributor to the environmental impact of the packaging system , and that it can not be diminished .

aVWaste management activity contribute to global greenhouse gas emission approximately by 4 % . In particular the disposal of waste in landfill generates methane that ha high global warming potential . Effective mitigation of greenhouse gas emission is important and could provide environmental benefit and sustainable development , a well a reduce adverse impact on public health . The European and UK waste policy force sustainable waste management and especially diversion from landfill , through reduction , reuse , recycling and composting , and recovery of value from waste . Energy from waste is a waste management option that could provide diversion from landfill and at the same time save a significant amount of greenhouse gas emission , since it recovers energy from waste which usually replaces an equivalent amount of energy generated from fossil fuel . Energy from waste is a wide definition and includes technology such a incineration of waste with energy recovery , or combustion of waste-derived fuel for energy production or advanced thermal treatment of waste with technology such a gasification and pyrolysis , with energy recovery . The present study assessed the greenhouse gas emission impact of three technology that could be used for the treatment of Municipal Solid Waste in order to recover energy from it . These technology are Mass Burn Incineration with energy recovery , Mechanical Biological Treatment via bio-drying and Mechanical Heat Treatment , which is a relatively new and uninvestigated method , compared to the other two . Mechanical Biological Treatment and Mechanical Heat Treatment can turn Municipal Solid Waste into Solid Recovered Fuel that could be combusted for energy production or replace other fuel in various industrial process . The analysis showed that performance of these two technology depends strongly on the final use of the produced fuel and they could produce GHG emission saving only when there is end market for the fuel . On the other hand Mass Burn Incineration generates greenhouse gas emission saving when it recovers electricity and heat . Moreover the study found that the expected increase on the amount of Municipal Solid Waste treated for energy recovery in England by 2020 could save greenhouse gas emission , if certain Energy from Waste technology would be applied , under certain condition .

aVProcesses affecting hurricane development over the North Atlantic like the El Nino Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) , the stratospheric Quasi-Biennial Oscillation ( QBO ) and Sea Surface Temperatures ( SSTs ) are discussed . Global coupled climate model simulation can not answer directly the question on enhancement of hurricane activity ( or it absence ) under increased greenhouse gas concentration because of their too coarse resolution . Therefore large-scale quantity that affect hurricane formation are investigated in a future warmer climate . More frequent or more intense hurricane are expected from an increase in the local SST , from more latent heat flux from the ocean to the atmosphere , from more westerly wind in the tropical stratosphere that reduces the occurrence of strong easterly phase of the QBO and from a more moist-unstable stratification of the atmosphere . However , a stronger vertical wind shear similar to the difference between El Nino and La Nina event suggests fewer hurricane in the northern Atlantic . Also a more dry-stable atmosphere would lead to fewer hurricane . Of the various forcing factor , the impact of wind shear appears to be more decisive , i.e . with a strong wind shear over the tropical Atlantic like during El Nino event strong hurricane hardly happen while impact from SSTs over the tropical Atlantic are le significant . As there are some factor favouring an increase of hurricane activity in a future climate and others favouring a decrease , it remains so far difficult to estimate their joint effect and to suggest any decisive trend . The area of hurricane development is limited among others by an increase of vertical wind shear towards the north and south from a minimum at 5-10 degree N. This wind shear pattern doe not change in a future climate and ha the potential of superseding impact from ocean warming . A need of very long time-series for obtaining robust result becomes obvious . Here at least 50 year of data were used . ( c ) 2008 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA . All right reserved .

aVAviation emission contribute to the radiative forcing ( RF ) of climate . Of importance are emission of carbon dioxide ( CO ( 2 ) ) nitrogen oxide ( NO . ) , aerosol and their precursor ( soot and sulphate ) , and increased cloudiness in the form of persistent linear contrail and induced-cirrus cloudiness . The recent Fourth Assessment Report ( AR4 ) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) quantified aviation 's RF contribution for 2005 based upon 2000 operation data . Aviation ha grown strongly over the past year , despite world-changing event in the early 2000s ; the average annual passenger traffic growth rate wa 5.3 % yr ( -1 ) between 2000 and 2007 , resulting in an increase of passenger traffic of 38 % . Presented here are updated value of aviation RF for 2005 based upon new operation data that show an increase in traffic of 22.5 % , fuel use of 8.4 % and total aviation RF of 14 % ( excluding induced-cirrus enhancement ) over the period 2000-2005 . The lack of physical process model and adequate observational data for aviation-induced cirrus effect limit confidence in quantifying their RF contribution . Total aviation RF ( excluding induced cirrus ) in 2005 wa similar to 55 mW m ( -2 ) ( 23-87 mW m ( -2 ) , 90 % likelihood range ) , which wa 3.5 % ( range 1.3-10 % . 90 % likelihood range ) of total anthropogenic forcing . Including estimate for aviation-induced cirrus RF increase the total aviation RF in 2005-78 mW m ( -2 ) ( 38-139 mW m ( -2 ) , 90 % likelihood range ) , which represents 4.9 % of total anthropogenic forcing ( 2-14 % , 90 % likelihood range ) . Future scenario of aviation emission for 2050 that are consistent with IPCC SIZES A1 and B2 scenario assumption have been presented that show an increase of fuel usage by factor of 2.7-3.9 over 2000 . Simplified calculation of total aviation RF in 2050 indicate increase by factor of 3.0-4.0 over the 2000 value , representing 4-4.7 % of total RF ( excluding induced cirrus ) . An examination of a range of future technological option show that substantive reduction in aviation fuel usage are possible only with the introduction of radical technology . Incorporation of aviation into an emission trading system offer the potential for overall ( i.e. , beyond the aviation sector ) CO ( 2 ) emission reduction . Proposals exist for introduction of such a system at a European level , but no agreement ha been reached at a global level . ( C ) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVArctic permafrost environment store large amount of organic carbon . As a result of global warming , intensified permafrost degradation and release of significant quantity of the currently conserved organic matter is predicted for high latitude . To improve our understanding of the present and future carbon dynamic in climate sensitive permafrost ecosystem , the present study investigates structure and carbon turnover of the bacterial community in a permafrost-affected soil of the Lena Delta ( 72 degree 22'N , 126 degree 28'E ) in northeastern Siberia . 16S rRNA gene clone library revealed the presence of all major soil bacterial group and of the canditate division OD1 and OP11 . A shift within the bacterial community wa observed along the soil profile indicated by the absence of Alphaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria and a simultaneous increase in abundance and diversity of fermenting bacteria like Firmicutes and Actinobacteria near the permafrost table . BIOLOG EcoPlates were used to describe the spectrum of utilized carbon source of the bacterial community in different horizon under in situ temperature condition in the presence and absence of oxygen . The result revealed distinct qualitative difference in the substrate used and the turnover rate under oxic and anoxic condition . It can be concluded that constantly negative redox potential a characteristic for the near permafrost table horizon of the investigated soil did effectively shape the structure of the indigenous bacterial community limiting it phylum-level diversity and carbon turnover capacity .

aVInjecting sulfate aerosol precursor into the stratosphere ha been suggested a a mean of geoengineering to cool the planet and reduce global warming . The decision to implement such a scheme would require a comparison of it benefit , danger , and cost to those of other response to global warming , including doing nothing . Here we evaluate those factor for stratospheric geoengineering with sulfate aerosol . Using existing U.S. military fighter and tanker plane , the annual cost of injecting aerosol precursor into the lower stratosphere would be several billion dollar . Using artillery or balloon to loft the gas would be much more expensive . We do not have enough information to evaluate more exotic technique , such a pumping the gas up through a hose attached to a tower or balloon system . Anthropogenic stratospheric aerosol injection would cool the planet , stop the melting of sea ice and land-based glacier , slow sea level rise , and increase the terrestrial carbon sink , but produce regional drought , ozone depletion , le sunlight for solar power , and make sky le blue . Furthermore it would hamper Earth-based optical astronomy , do nothing to stop ocean acidification , and present many ethical and moral issue . Further work is needed to quantify many of these factor to allow informed decision-making . Citation : Robock , A. , A. Marquardt , B. Kravitz , and G.

aVConverting available biomass from municipal , agricultural and forest waste to bio-methanol can result in significant environmental and economic benefit . Keeping these benefit in mind , one plausible scenario discussed here is the potential to produce energy using bio-methanol in five state of the western United States . In this scenario , the bio-methanol produced is from different biomass source and used a a substitute for fossil fuel in energy production . In the U.S. West , forest material are the dominant biomass waste source in Idaho , Montana , Oregon and Washington , while in California , the greatest amount of available biomass is from municipal waste . Using a 100 % rate of substitution , bio-methanol produced from these source can replace an amount equivalent to most or all of the gasoline consumed by motor vehicle in each state . In contrast , when bio-methanol powered fuel cell are used to produce electricity , it is possible to generate 12-25 % of the total electricity consumed annually in these five state . As a gasoline substitute , bio-methanol can optimally reduce vehicle C emission by 2-29 Tg of C ( 23-81 % of the total emitted by each state ) . Alternatively , if bio-methanol supported fuel cell are used to generate electricity , from 2 to 32 Tg of C emission can be avoided . The emission avoided , in this case , could equate to 25-32 % of the total emission produced by these particular western state when fossil fuel are used to generate electricity . The actual C emission avoided will be lower than the estimate here because C emission from the methanol production process are not included ; however , such emission are expected to be relatively low . In general , there is le carbon emitted when bio-methanol is used to generate electricity with fuel cell than when it is used a a motor vehicle fuel . In the state of Washington , thinning `` high-fire-risk '' small stem , namely 5.1-22.9 cm diameter tree , from wildfire-prone forest and using them to produce methanol for electricity generation with fuel cell would avoid C emission of 3.7-7.3 Mg C/ha . Alternatively , when wood-methanol produced from the high-fire-risk wood is used a a gasoline substitute , 3.3-6.6 Mg C/ha of carbon emission are avoided . If these same `` high-fire-risk '' woody stem were burned during a wildfire 7.9 Mg C/ha would be emitted in the state of Washington alone . Although detailed economic analysis of producing methanol from biomass are in it infancy , we believe that converting biomass into methanol and substituting it for fossilfuel-based energy production is a viable option in location that have high biomass availability .

Inv . Agr . 36 ( 2 ) :215-228 . Current climate condition in north-central Chile ( 25 degree 57'-32 degree 13 'S 71 degree 43'-68 degree 16'W ) arc characterized by increase temperature and decreasing rainfall . Global warming is expected to alter the hydrology and ecoclimatic characteristic of north-central basin with Multiple effect , including change in plant and arthropod phenology and biodiversity . Among these basin , the Elqui Valley ( 29 degree 50 'S , 70 degree 52'W ) stand out for it large population and the economic importance of tourism and agriculture . The taxonomic composition of agriculturally and medically important arthropod wa studied in three location in the Elqui Valley by manual capture of specimen and interview with farmer , agricultural worker , and local leader . Out of a total of 145 specie of insect and 36 specie of arachnid , 36 insect and I arachnid are considered pest and are known to attack one or more host plant . four order dominated the insect suryes : Coleoptera ( 31.3 % , . of the total captured ) , Orthoptera ( 13.9 % ) , Hymenoptera ( 9.3 % ) , and Lepidoptera ( 13.4 % ) . Sonic agriculturally important insect include Macrosiphum , Rhopalosiphum . Myzus ( Aphididae ) , Coccus , Parthenolecanium , Saissetia ( Coccidae ) and Pseudococcus ( Pseudococcidae ) . Sonic medically important specie are those in the zoonotic genus Loxosceles , Latrodectus , Triatoma , and Mepraia . The study of agriculturally and medically important arthropod will improve the design of better of management plan to minimize the vulnerability of ecosystem to climate change .

aVTo investigate the interactive effect of increasing [ CO ( 2 ) ] and heat wave occurrence on isoprene ( IE ) and methanol ( ME ) emission , Platanus orientalis wa grown for one month in ambient ( 380 mu mol mol ( -1 ) ) or elevated ( 800 mu mol mol ( -1 ) ) [ CO ( 2 ) ] and exposed to high temperature ( HT ) ( 38 degree C/4 h ) . In pre-existing leaf , IE emission were always higher but ME emission lower a compared to newly-emerged leaf . They were both stimulated by HT . Elevated [ CO ( 2 ) ] significantly reduced IE in both leaf type , whereas it increased ME in newly-emerged leaf only . In newly-emerged leaf , elevated [ CO ( 2 ) ] decreased photosynthesis and altered the chloroplast ultrastructure and membrane integrity . These harmful effect were amplified by HT . HT did not cause any unfavorable effect in pre-existing leaf , which were characterized by inherently higher IE rate . We conclude that : ( 1 ) these result further prove the isoprene 's putative thermo-protective role of membrane ; ( 2 ) HT may likely outweigh the inhibitory effect of elevated [ CO ( 2 ) ] on IE in the future .

aVThe emergence of C4 photosynthesis in plant a a significant component of terrestrial ecosystem is thought to be an adaptive response to change in atmospheric CO ( 2 ) concentration and/or climate during Neogene time and ha had a profound effect on the global terrestrial biosphere . Although expansion of C4 grass in the latest Miocene and Pliocene ha been widely documented around the world , the spatial and temporal variation in the C4 expansion are still not well understood and it driving mechanism remain a contentious issue . Here we present the result of carbon and oxygen isotope analysis of fossil and modern mammalian tooth enamel sample from the central Inner Mongolia . Our sample represent a diverse group of herbivorous mammal including deer , elephant , rhino , horse and giraffe , ranging in age from the late Oligocene to modern . The delta ( 13 ) C value of 91 tooth enamel sample of early late-Miocene age or older , with the exception of two 13 Ma rhino sample ( -7.8 and -7.6 part per thousand ) and one 8.5 Ma suspected rhino sample ( -7.6 part per thousand ) , were all le than -8.0 part per thousand ( VPDB ) , indicating that there were no C4 grass present in their diet and thus probably few or no C4 grass in the ecosystem of the central Inner Mongolia prior to similar to 8 Ma . However , 12 out of 26 tooth enamel sample of younger age ( similar to 7.5 Ma to similar to 3.9 Ma ) have delta ( 13 ) C value higher than -8.0 part per thousand ( up to - 2.4 part per thousand ) , indicating that herbivore in the area had variable diet ranging from pure C3 to mixed C3-C4 vegetation during that time interval . The presence of C4 grass in herbivore ' diet ( up to similar to 76 % C4 ) suggests that C4 grass were a significant component of the local ecosystem in the latest Miocene and early Pliocene , consistent with the hypothesis of a global factor a the driving mechanism of the late Miocene C4 expansion . Today , C3 grass dominate grassland in the central Inner Mongolia area . The retreat of C4 grass from this area after the early Pliocene may have been driven by regional climate change associated with tectonic process in central Asia a well a global climate change .

aVAmazonian forest reserve have significant carbon benefit , but the methodology used for accounting for these benefit will be critical in determining whether the powerful economic force represented by mitigation effort to slow global warming will be applied to creating these reserve . Opportunities for reserve creation are quickly being lost a new area are opened to deforestation though highway construction and other development . Leakage , or the effect that a reserve or other mitigation project provokes outside of the project boundary , is critical to a proper accounting of net carbon benefit . Protected area in the Amazon have particularly great potential mitigation benefit over an extended time horizon . Over a 100-year time frame , virtually no unprotected forest is likely to remain , meaning that potential leakage ( both leakage to the vicinity of the reserve and that displaced by removing protected area from the land-grabbing market ) should not matter much because any short-term leakage would be `` recovered '' eventually . The effect of the value attributed to time greatly influence the impact of leakage on benefit credited to reserve . Simple assumption regarding leakage scenario illustrate the benefit of reserve and the critical area where agreement is necessary to make this option a practical component of mitigation effort . The stake are too high to allow further delay in reaching agreement on these issue .

aVGlobal warming risk from emission of greenhouse gas ( GHGs ) by anthropogenic activity have increased the need for the identification of ecosystem with high carbon sink capacity a an alternative mitigation strategy of terrestrial carbon sequestration . The agroforestry sector ha received recent attention for it enormous potential carbon pool that reduce carbon emission to the atmosphere . The Nubra Valley ( Trans-Himalayan region ) is covered with more than 575,000 agroforestry plantation ( willow and poplar ) . These specie have been found to sequester more than 75,000 tonne of carbon . Every year these plantation are contributing 400 tonne of leaf litter to the ground , which is one of the best source of soil organic carbon . This communication attempt to suggest some appropriate management practice to improve soil organic carbon pool by analysing available information of agroforestry plant in the Nubra Valley by quantification of biomass contribution by willow and poplar specie within the valley and CO ( 2 ) sequestration rate by the living biomass .

aVThe interest on energy recovery from renewable source is increasing due to the global warming and fossil fuel limitation . Biomass thermochemical conversion method present some significant advantage such a zero net emission and the use of agricultural by-product . in this work , a study of the catalytic and non-catalytic pyrolysis of an exhausted olive waste wa carried out . The objective wa to characterize the solid , liquid and gaseous phase in term of their energy content . Two experimental series were conducted : uncatalyzed process , studying the influence of temperature in the range 400-900 degree C ; and catalyzed one , investigating the influence of temperature ( 500-800 degree C ) and quantity of catalyst ( 0-100 g ) . Also , the dolomite effectiveness a catalyst wa evaluated . For this motive , consecutive experiment , without reactivating dolomite , were carried out ( 0-6 run ) , and the yield of solid , liquid and gas were determined . It wa found that increasing temperature lead in both series to a decrease in the solid and liquid yield and to an increase in the gas yield . The presence and amount of catalyst caused a significant decrease in the liquid phase yield and a high increase in the gas phase yield giving rise to a vast rise in hydrogen production . On the other hand , the catalyst proved to be stable and did not lose activity during at least six pyrolysis cycle . Finally , a a previous step to the design of industrial installation , a kinetic study of the process wa performed , based on the generation of the principal gas , considering that these are formed through parallel independent first-order reaction , with different activation energy .

aVDuring their many million of year of evolution in the extreme and stable cold , Antarctic notothenioid fish have acquired profoundly cold-adapted physiology . Gene expression profiling via cDNA microarray wa used to determine the extent to which one specie of notothenioid , Trematomus bernacchii , ha retained the ability to alter gene expression in response to heat stress . While an inability to up-regulate the expression of any size class of heat shock protein ( except for a 1.1-fold induction of the co-chaperone Hsp40 ) wa observed , hundred of additional gene , associated with a broad range of cellular process , were responsive to heat . Many of these gene are associated with central aspect of the evolutionarily conserved cellular stress response ( CSR ) , which play a pivotal role in responding to physical and chemical stress . The inability of T. bernacchii to mount a heat shock response underscore the potential susceptibility of this specie to the effect of global warming .

aVDecrease in forest area world wide and the damaging of it structure is hazardous to human health , hinders and dry up the spread of oxygen in the air and also destroys carbon storage . In recent year , global warming and change in climate depending on the increase in the green house gas have been affecting the whole world . The solution seeking , initiated in the international arena with various treaty and process , ha shown itself around the world and in our country a the concept of planning and operation of the forest source . During the recent ten year in Turkey , in forest management plan , the capacity of carbon storage and the amount of oxygen production by the forest were initiated to be calculated in the planning unit scale . The first forest management plan were prepared and put into force in 1972 in Turkey , where the planned forestry began in 1963 . During the period of more than 30 year , neither the structural change in forest nor their value regarding other function have been examined enough . In this article , using Balci Forest Management Units in Borcka Township of Artvin , forest are studied regarding their growing stock , timber increment , their capacity of carbon storage and oxygen production . The basic management unit scale in the study is standard and the evident standard parameter are tree specie , mixture and age class . Balci Management Unit underwent attack from bark beetle in the past . After the mechanical struggle , there have been structural change in forest ecosystem and the potential of forest have varied both in quality and quantity . Changes in forest ecosystem during that time , not only through natural way but also through human activity , have been shaping the oncoming forestry practice .

aVIn this paper , precipitation concentration across the Pearl River basin and the associated spatial pattern are analyzed based on daily precipitation data of 42 rain gauging station during the period 1960-2005 . Regions characterized by the different changing property of precipitation concentration index ( CI ) are identified . The southwest and northeast part of the Pearl River basin are characterized by lower and decreasing precipitation CI ; the northwest and south part of the study river basin show higher and increasing precipitation CI . Higher but decreasing precipitation CI are found in the West and East River basin . Comparison of precipitation CI trend before and after 1990 show that most part of the Pearl River basin are characterized by increasing precipitation CI after 1990 . Decreasing precipitation CI after 1990 ( compared to precipitation CI change before 1990 ) is observed only in a few station located in the lower Gui River and the lower Yu River . Significant increasing precipitation CI after 1990 is detected in the West River , lower North River and upper Beipan River . These change of precipitation CI in the Pearl River basin are likely to be associated with the consequence of the well-evidenced global warming . These finding can contribute to basin-scale water resource management and conservation of ecological environment in the Pearl River basin .

aVPerfluorocarbons ( PFCs ) gas have high global warming potential ( GWP ) and a long lifetime in the atmosphere . It is difficult to decompose these gas due to their tetrahedral structure arising from strong C-F bond . This paper discussed C ( 2 ) F ( 6 ) ( one of PFCs gas ) thermal decomposition characteristic under 950-1100 degree C in a laboratory scale reactor . The effect of C ( 2 ) F ( 6 ) initial concentration , reaction temperature , residence time on C ( 2 ) F ( 6 ) decomposition ratio were also investigated . The experimental result indicate that the lower initial C ( 2 ) F ( 6 ) concentration , higher reaction temperature , longer residence time can promote C ( 2 ) F ( 6 ) decomposition ratio . On the basis of the result , it can be drawn that the reaction order of C ( 2 ) F ( 6 ) thermal decomposition is between 0 and 1 . Above 90 % C ( 2 ) F ( 6 ) decomposition ratio can be achieved under a temperature of 1100 degree C , 223.21 mu mol/L initial C ( 2 ) F ( 6 ) concentration and 2 s residence time . Basis on the calculation , the activation energy ( E ) and the frequency factor ( A ) of C ( 2 ) F ( 6 ) thermal decomposition in the temperature range of 950-1100 degree C were 313.2 kJ/mol and 8.8 x 10 ( 11 ) s ( -1 ) , respectively .

aVBiomass burning smoke constituent are worthy of concern due to it influence on climate and human health . The organic constituent and distribution of molecular tracer emitted from burning smoke of six natural vegetation including monsoon evergreen broad-leaf tree and shrub in South China were determined in this study . The gas and particle sample were collected and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry . The major organic component in these smoke sample are methoxyphenols from lignin and saccharide from cellulose . Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( PAHs ) are also present a minor constituent . Furanose , pyranose and their dianhydrides are the first reported in the biomass burning smoke . Some unique biomarkers were detected in this study which may be useful a specific tracer . The corresponding tracer/OC ratio are used a indicator for the two type of biomass burning . U/R ( 1.06-1.72 ) in the smoke sample may be used a parameter to distinguish broad-leaf tree and shrub from fossil fuel . Other useful diagnostic ratio such a methylphenanthrene to phenanthrene ( MPhe/Phe ) , phenanthrene to phenanthrene plus anthracene ( Phe/ ( Phe + Ant ) ) and fluoranthene to fluoranthene plus pyrene ( Flu/ ( Flu + Pyr ) ) and octadecenoic acid/OC are also identified in this study . These result are useful in effort to better understand the emission characterization of biomass burning in South China and the contribution of regional biomass burning to global climate change .

aVNature 's photosynthesis us the sun 's energy with chlorophyll in plant a a catalyst to recycle carbon dioxide and water into new plant life . Only given Sufficient geological time can new fossil fuel be formed naturally . In contrast , chemical recycling of carbon dioxide from natural and industrial Sources a well a varied human activity or even from the air itself to methanol or dimethyl ether ( DME ) and their varied product can be achieved via it capture and subsequent reductive hydrogenative conversion . The present Perspective review this new approach and our research in the field over the last 15 year . Carbon recycling represents a significant aspect of our proposed Methanol Economy . Any available energy source ( alternative energy such a solar , wind , geothermal , and atomic energy ) can be used for the production of needed hydrogen and chemical conversion of CO ( 2 ) . Improved new method for the efficient reductive conversion of CO ( 2 ) to methanol and/or DME that we have developed include bireforming with methane and way of catalytic or electrochemical conversion . Liquid methanol is preferable to highly volatile and potentially explosive hydrogen for energy storage and transportation . Together with the derived DME , they are excellent transportation fuel for internal combustion engine ( ICE ) and fuel cell a well a convenient starting material for synthetic hydrocarbon and their varied product . Carbon dioxide thus can be chemically transformed from a detrimental greenhouse gas causing global warming into a valuable , renewable and inexhaustible carbon source of the future allowing environmentally neutral use of carbon fuel and derived hydrocarbon product .

aVTwo specie found in temperate calcareous and mesotrophic grassland ( Dactylis glomerata and Leontodon hispidus ) were exposed to eight ozone treatment spanning preindustrial to post-2100 regime , and late-season effect on stomatal functioning were investigated . The plant were grown a a mixed community in 14 L container and were exposed to ozone in ventilated solardomes ( dome-shaped greenhouse ) for 20 week from early May to late September 2007 . Ozone exposure were based on O ( 3 ) concentration from a nearby upland area , and provided the following seasonal 24 h mean : 21.4 , 39.9 ( simulated ambient ) , 50.2 , 59.4 , 74.9 , 83.3 , 101.3 and 102.5 ppb . In both specie , stomatal conductance of undamaged inner canopy leaf developing since a midseason cutback increased linearly with increasing background ozone concentration . Imposition of severe water stress by leaf excision indicated that increasing background ozone concentration decreased the ability of leaf to limit water loss , implying impaired stomatal control . The threshold ozone concentration for these effect were 15-40 ppb above current ambient in upland UK , and were within the range of ozone concentration anticipated for much of Europe by the latter part of this century . The potential mechanism behind the impaired stomatal functioning wa investigated using a transpiration assay . Unlike for lower ozone treatment , apparently healthy green leaf of L. hispidus that had developed in the 101.3 ppb treatment did not close their stoma in response to 1.5 mu m abscisic acid ( ABA ) ; indeed stomatal opening initially occurred in this treatment . Thus , ozone appears to be disrupting the ABA-induced signal transduction pathway for stomatal control thereby reducing the ability of plant to respond to drought . These result have potentially wide-reaching implication for the functioning of community under global warming where period of soil drying and episode of high vapour pressure deficit are likely to be more severe .

aVA 96-yr climate record ( 1908-2004 ) , historical description , multiyear ( 1950 , 1964 , 1978 , 1994 ) lake-surface area measurement , and 1950 and 2004 physiognomically based vegetation map were compiled to ass vegetation change in the Fox Lake area ( 4248 ha ) within the lower Peace River district of northern Alberta . A climate warming trent ( r = 0.615 , P < 0.001 ; 0.35 degree C/decade ) wa evident during the twentieth century , with peak precipitation occuring from 1970 to 1990 . Five major wet-dry cycle , based on net water balance value ( precipitation minus potential evaporation ) , were evident with peak occuring at about 17 ( +/- 3 ) year interval . Each cycle became slightly le arid than the previous until the mid-1990s . Deciduous forest dominated upland site in 2004 , whereas deciduous shrub and juvenile tree stand comprised 78 % in 1950 . Total wetland area remained relateively constant between 1950 and 2004 , but le meadow and more standing water were present in 2004 . Lake-surface area change suggested that wetland were recharged by precipitatio rather than floodwaters from the nearby Peace River . Low water availability and historical description suggest grassland-dominated parkland-like vegetation occured in the study area during the early part of the twentieth century , with upland shrub replacing grassland by 1950 . Increased atmospheric water availability rather than cessation of aboriginal burning or natural fire wa considered responsible for increased forest abundance after 1945 . Greater aridity in response to future global warming could reduce the abundance of forest in lower Peace River district , and shift the regional climate from a boreal to a grassland-dominated parkland climatic regime .

aVGlobal warming is affecting the world and will continue to affect human and the ecosystem in the future , in different region of the earth in diverse way : air temperature rise , modification in the precipitation and snow/ice melting rate , sea level rise , change in geographical distribution , and even extinction of some plant and animal . In particular , the prediction presented in the 2007 Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , Working Group 1 ( available at www.ipcc.ch ) for the mean temperature increase in the present century is about ( 31 ) C/century for a middle range scenario of human behavior . Mitigation measure need to be taken urgently in all aspect of activity in order to reduce the future impact of the temperature augmentation . In particular , the drying process ( a well a the pre- and post-drying operation ) need to be reanalyzed , in order to try to participate in this world effort to reduce the impact of anthropogenic activity that introduce in the atmosphere an excess of greenhouse gas ( GHG ) . The energy saving , use of renewable energy , optimization of each part of the drying process , and use of control device for detecting and minimizing the atmospheric injection of GHG are some of a large number of possible action to be taken in this respect . A nice example of how a planetary problem can be solved with the global participation of scientist , professional , authority and general public is the stopping of the destruction of the ozone layer and it possible recuperation in the near future , a discussed in the WMO related report ( Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion : 2006 , that can be obtained at http : //www.wmo.int/pages/prog/arep/gaw/ozone2006/ozoneasstreport.html ) .

aVBackground : As Earth warms , temperate and subpolar marine specie will increasingly shift their geographic range poleward . The endemic shelf fauna of Antarctica is especially vulnerable to climate-mediated biological invasion because cold temperature currently exclude the durophagous ( shell-breaking ) predator that structure shallow-benthic community elsewhere . Methodology/Principal Findings : We used the Eocene fossil record from Seymour Island , Antarctic Peninsula , to project specifically how global warming will reorganize the nearshore benthos of Antarctica . A long-term cooling trend , which began with a sharp temperature drop similar to 41 Ma ( million year ago ) , eliminated durophagous predators-teleosts ( modern bony fish ) , decapod crustacean ( crab and lobster ) and almost all neoselachian elasmobranch ( modern shark and ray ) from Antarctic nearshore water after the Eocene . Even prior to those extinction , durophagous predator became le active a coastal sea temperature declined from 41 Ma to the end of the Eocene , similar to 33.5 Ma . In response , dense population of suspension-feeding ophiuroids and crinoid abruptly appeared . Dense aggregation of brachiopod transcended the cooling event with no apparent change in predation pressure , nor were there change in the frequency of shell-drilling predation on venerid bivalve . Conclusions/Significance : Rapid warming in the Southern Ocean is now removing the physiological barrier to shell-breaking predator , and crab are returning to the Antarctic Peninsula . Over the coming decade to century , we predict a rapid reversal of the Eocene trend . Increasing predation will reduce or eliminate extant dense population of suspension-feeding echinoderm from nearshore habitat along the Peninsula while brachiopod will continue to form large population , and the intensity of shell-drilling predation on infaunal bivalve will not change appreciably . In time the ecological effect of global warming could spread to other portion of the Antarctic coast . The differential response of faunal component will reduce the endemic character of Antarctic subtidal community , homogenizing them with nearshore community at lower latitude .

aVThe capacity of climatic condition to modulate the extent and intensity of parasitism is well known since long ago . Concerning helminth , among the numerous environmental modification giving rise to change in infection , climate variable appear a those showing a greater influence , so that climate change may be expected to have an important impact on the disease they cause . However , the confirmation of the impact of climate change on helminthiases ha been reached very recently . Only shortly before , helminthiases were still noted a infectious disease scarcely affected by climate change , when compared to disease caused by microorganism in general ( virus , bacteriae , protozoan ) . The aim of the present paper is to review the impact of climate change on helminthiases transmitted by snail , invertebrate which are pronouncedly affected by meteorological factor , by focusing on trematodiases . First , the knowledge on the effect of climate change on trematodiases in general is reviewed , including aspect such a influence of temperature on cercarial output , cercarial production variability in trematode specie , influence of magnitude of cercarial production and snail host size , cercarial quality , duration of cercarial production increase and host mortality , influence of latitude , and global-warming-induced impact of trematode . Secondly , important zoonotic disease such a fascioliasis , schistosomiasis and cercarial dermatitis are analysed from the point of view of their relationship with meteorological factor . Emphasis is given to data which indicate that climate change influence the characteristic of these trematodiases in concrete area where these disease are emerging in recent year . The present review show that trematode , similarly a other helminth presenting larval stage living freely in the environment and/or larval stage parasitic in invertebrate easily affected by climate change a arthropod and mollusc a intermediate host , may be largely more susceptible to climate change impact than those helminth in whose life cycle such phase are absent or reduced to a minimum . Although helminth also appear to be affected by climate change , their main difference with microparasites lie on the usually longer life cycle of helminth , with longer generation time , slower population growth rate and longer time period needed for the response in the definitive host to become evident . Consequently , after a pronounced climate change in a local area , modification in helminth population need more time to be obvious or detectable than modification in microparasite population . Similarly , the relation of change in a helminthiasis with climatic factor change , a extreme event elapsed relatively long time ago , may be overlooked if not concretely searched for . All indicates that this phenomenon ha been the reason for previous analysis to conclude that helminthiases do not constitute priority target in climate change impact study . ( C ) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

aVMost mass extinction during the last 500 m.y . coincide with eruption of large igneous province ( LIPs ) . The Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction wa synchronous with the Deccan flood volcanism , the Permian-Triassic extinction with the eruption of the enormous Siberian trap , and the end-Guadalupian extinction with the Emeishan volcanic province . The causal link remains disputed , however , and many LIPs apparently had no significant impact on the biosphere . Here we show that a key control on the destructive consequence of LIP emplacement is the type of sedimentary rock in basin beneath the flood basalt . Contact metamorphism around intrusion in dolomite , evaporite , coal , or organic-rich shale generates large quantity of greenhouse and toxic gas ( CO ( 2 ) , CH ( 4 ) , SO ( 2 ) ) , which subsequently vent to the atmosphere and cause global warming and mass extinction . The release of sediment-derived gas had a far greater impact on the environment than the emission of magmatic gas .

aVTheoretical potential geoengineering solution to the global warming problem have recently been proposed . Here , we present an idealized study of the climate response to deliberately seeding large-scale stratocumulus cloud deck in the North Pacific , South Pacific , and South Atlantic , thereby inducing cooling via aerosol indirect effect . Atmosphere-only , atmosphere/mixed-layer ocean , and fully coupled atmosphere/ocean version of the Met Office Hadley Centre model are used to investigate the radiative forcing , climate efficacy , and regional response of temperature , precipitation , and net primary productivity to such geoengineering . The radiative forcing simulation indicate that , for our parameterization of aerosol indirect effect , up to 35 % of the radiative forcing due to current level of greenhouse gas could be offset by stratocumulus modification . Equilibrium simulation with the atmosphere/mixed-layer ocean model , wherein each of the three stratocumulus sheet is modified in turn , reveal that the most efficient cooling per unit radiative forcing occurs when the South Pacific stratocumulus sheet is modified . Transient coupled model simulation suggest that geoengineering all three stratocumulus area delay the simulated global warming by about 25 year . These simulation also indicate that , while some area experience increase in precipitation and net primary productivity , sharp decrease are simulated in South America , with particularly detrimental impact on the Amazon rain forest . These result show that , while some area benefit from geoengineering , there are significant area where the response could be very detrimental with implication for the practical applicability of such a scheme .

aVThe climate response of the equatorial Pacific to increased greenhouse gas is investigated using numerical experiment from 11 climate model participating in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 's Fourth Assessment Report . Multimodel mean climate response to CO ( 2 ) doubling are identified and related to change in the heat budget of the surface layer . Weaker ocean surface current driven by a slowing down of the Walker circulation reduce ocean dynamical cooling throughout the equatorial Pacific . The combined anomalous ocean dynamical plus radiative heating from CO ( 2 ) is balanced by different process in the western and eastern basin : Cloud cover feedback and evaporation balance the heating over the warm pool , while increased cooling by ocean vertical heat transport balance the warming over the cold tongue . This increased cooling by vertical ocean heat transport arises from increased near-surface thermal stratification , despite a reduction in vertical velocity . The stratification response is found to be a permanent feature of the equilibrium climate potentially linked to both thermodynamical and dynamical change within the equatorial Pacific . Briefly stated , ocean dynamical change act to reduce ( enhance ) the net heating in the east ( west ) . This explains why the model simulate enhanced equatorial warming , rather than El Nino-like warming , in response to a weaker Walker circulation . To conclude , the implication for detecting these signal in the modern observational record are discussed .

aVGlobal warming will affect all specie but in largely unknown way , with certain region such a the Mediterranean Basin and it major island including Sardinia being particularly vulnerable to desertification . Olive ( Olea europaea ) is of eco-social importance in the Mediterranean where it wa domesticated . This drought-resistant crop and it major pest , the olive fly ( Bactrocera oleae ) , have tight biological link that make them a suitable model system for climate change study in the Mediterranean . Here a physiologically based weather-driven demographic model of olive and olive fly is used to analyze in detail this plant-pest system in Sardinia under observed weather ( 10 year of daily data from 48 location ) , three climate warming scenario ( increase of 1 , 2 and 3 degree C in average daily temperature ) , and a 105-year climate model scenario for the Alghero location ( e.g . 1951-2055 ) . grass gi is used to map model prediction of olive bloom date and yield , total season-long olive fly pupa , and percent fruit attacked by the fly . Island wide simulation data are summarized using multivariate regression . Model calibration with field bloom date data were performed to increase simulation accuracy of olive flowering prediction under climate change . As climate warms , the range of olive is predicted to expand to higher altitude and consolidate elsewhere , especially in coastal area . The range of olive fly will extend into previously unfavorable cold area , but will contract in warm inland lowland where temperature approach it upper thermal limit . Consequently , many area of current high risk are predicted to have decreased risk of fly damage with climate warming . Simulation using a 105-year climate model scenario for Alghero , Sardinia predicts change in the olive-olive fly system expected to occur if climate continued to warm at the low rate observed during in the past half century .

aVNowadays , the scientific and social significance of the research of climatic effect ha become outstanding . In order to be able to predict the ecological effect of the global climate change , it is necessary to study monitoring database of the past and explore connection . For the case study mentioned in the title , historical weather data series from the Hungarian Meteorological Service and Szaniszlo Priszter 's monitoring data on the phenology of geophyte have been used . These data describe on which day the observed geophyte budded , were blooming and withered . In our research we have found that the classification of the observed year according to phenological event and the classification of those according to the frequency distribution of meteorological parameter show similar pattern , and the one variable group is suitable for explaining the pattern shown by the other one . Furthermore , our important result is that the date of all three observed phenophases correlate significantly with the average of the daily temperature fluctuation in the given period . The second most often significant parameter is the number of frosty day , this also seem to be determinant for all phenophases . Usual approach based on the temperature sum and the average temperature do n't seem to be really important in this respect . According to the result of the research , it ha turned out that the phenology of geophyte can be well modelled with the linear combination of suitable meteorological parameter

aVThermal Energy Storage ( TES ) provides u with a flexible heating and/or cooling tool to combat global warming through conserving energy while utilising natural renewable energy resource . This paper aim to show how CO ( 2 ) emission can be decreased by utilising different TES concept in Turkey . The first project is for the heating and cooling of a supermarket using Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage ( ATES ) in Mersin . With a 60 % higher Coefficient of Performance ( COP ) , the yearly CO ( 2 ) emission reduction contribution of this project is 113 tonne . The second project concern ATES for the heating and cooling of a greenhouse in Adana . The greenhouse wa used a a 'solar collector ' and source of energy for the ATES system . No fossil fuel were consumed for heating the greenhouse and cooling wa made possible with the ATES system . Energy conservation amounted to 68 % and CO ( 2 ) emission were reduced by 26 tonnes/year . The third one is a pilot project using TES in microencapsulated phase change material in a test cabin in Adana with a floor area of 4 m ( 2 ) . By using a 3.5 kg Phase Change Material ( PCM ) together with insulation panel in the test cabin , 7 % cooling energy and 28 % heating energy can be conserved . The corresponding CO ( 2 ) emission reduction would be 0.5 tonnes/year .

aVCoal is the abundant domestic energy resource in India and is projected to remain so in future under a business-as-usual scenario . Using domestic coal mitigates national energy security risk . However coal use exacerbates global climate change . Under a strict climate change regime , coal use is projected to decline in future . However this would increase import of energy source like natural gas ( NG ) and nuclear and consequent energy security risk for India . The paper show that carbon dioxide ( CO ( 2 ) ) capture and storage ( CCS ) can mitigate CO ( 2 ) emission from coal-based large point source ( LPS ) cluster and therefore would play a key role in mitigating both energy security risk for India and global climate change risk . This paper estimate future CO ( 2 ) emission projection from LPS in India , identifies the potential CO ( 2 ) storage type at aggregate level and match the two into the future using Asia-Pacific Integrated Model ( AIM/Local model ) with a Geographical Information System ( GIS ) interface . The paper argues that clustering LPS that are close to potential storage site could provide reasonable economic opportunity for CCS in future if storage site of different type are further explored and found to have adequate capacity . The paper also indicates possible LPS location to utilize CCS opportunity economically in future , especially since India is projected to add over 220,000 MW of thermal power generation capacity by 2030 .

aVThe collection , transfer and transport of waste are basic activity of waste management system all over the world . These activity all use energy and fuel , primarily of fossil origin . Electricity and fuel consumption of the individual process were reviewed and greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emission were quantified . The emission factor were assigned a global warming potential ( GWP ) and aggregated into global warming factor ( GWFs ) , which express the potential contribution to global warming from collection , transport and transfer of 1 tonne of wet waste . Six example involving collection , transfer and transport of waste were assessed in term of GHG emission , including both provision and use of energy . ( GHG emission related to production , maintenance and disposal of vehicle , equipment , infrastructure and building were excluded . ) The estimated GWFs varied from 9.4 to 368 kg CO ( 2 ) -equivalent ( kg CO ( 2 ) -eq . ) per tonne of waste , depending on method of collection , capacity and choice of transport equipment , and travel distance . The GHG emission can be reduced primarily by avoiding transport of waste in private car and by optimization of long distance transport , for example , considering transport by rail and waterway .

aVNon-fossil fuel energy option can help reduce or eliminate the emission of greenhouse gas and are needed to combat climate change . Three distinct way in which non-fossil fuel option can be used in society are examined here : the capture/production of non-fossil fuel energy source , their conversion into appropriate energy carrier and increased efficiency throughout the life cycle . Non-fossil fuel energy source are insufficient to avoid global warming in that they are not necessarily readily utilisable in their natural form . Hydrogen energy system are needed to facilitate the use of non-fossil fuel by converting them to two main class of energy carrier : hydrogen ( and hydrogen-derived fuel ) and electricity . High efficiency is needed to allow the greatest benefit to be attained from energy option in term of climate change and other factor . A case study is considered involving the production of hydrogen from non-fossil energy source via thermochemical water decomposition . Thermochemical water decomposition provides a realistic future non-fossil fuel energy option , which can be driven by non-fossil energy source ( particularly nuclear or solar energy ) and help combat global warming .

aVEarthworm functioning and temperature regime are among the most important biotic and abiotic factor of soil environment ; their combined action on soil nematode activity ha not been studied . In a 4-month laboratory experiment , effect of the epigeic earthworm Dendrobaena octaedra on a succession of nematode community in litter of a mid-European birch/oak forest were tested in the gradient of an increase of diurnal temperature fluctuation from 0 degree C ( constant 15 degree C ; T ( 15 ) ) to 10 degree C ( daily range between 10 degree and 20 degree C ; T ( 10-20 ) ) and 20 degree C ( daily range between 5 degree and 25 degree C ; T ( 5-25 ) ) . Earthworm and temperature effect were measured a difference in nematode community respiration rate between the experimental treatment . Nematode respiration rate were calculated on the basis of body size/weight/O ( 2 ) consumption relationship for individual specie . Nematode community wa dominated by bacterial feeder and changed in a characteristic successional pattern which , however , wa markedly modified by temperature regime and earthworm activity . Dominant nematode taxon revealed specific pattern of temporal dynamic in connection with their response to temperature and earthworm presence . Thus , metabolic activity of Plectus acuminatus wa strongly reduced by D. octaedra but did not react to variation of temperature regime . In contrast , activity of Panagrolaimus sp . significantly responded to temperature but not to earthworm presence , whereas Pl . thornei reacted to both factor separately and in combination . Ceratoplectus armatus wa stronger affected by earthworm presence then by temperature ; Tylocephalus auriculatus showed the opposite pattern . The variety of response may explain the coexistence of several taxonomically related ( Plectidae ) and trophically similar specie within the dominant group . Both earthworm presence and increase of the range of diurnal temperature fluctuation strongly affected the net of interspecific correlation within the nematode community . Earthworms strongly reduced total activity of nematode community at any temperature regime . T ( 15 ) regime showed markedly lower level of cumulative nematode respiration than both fluctuating regime , irrespective of earthworm presence . In conclusion , combined effect of earthworm and temperature regime drastically changed pattern of relationship within the nematode litter community . The result of the experiment may have implication for the perspective of global warming event at the study site : it is suggested that the ultimate vector of the change in litter environment might be directed towards the condition of the treatment [ T ( 15 ) regime ; earthworm present ] , with the corresponding trend in the development of the litter nematode community .

aVRecent increase in fuel cost , concern for global warming , and limited supply of fossil fuel have prompted wide spread research on renewable liquid biofuels produced domestically from agricultural feedstock . In this study , two type of biodiesels and vegetable oil ( VO ) are investigated a potential fuel for gas turbine to generate power . Biodiesels produced from VO and animal fat were considered in this study . The problem of high viscosity and poor volatility of VO ( soybean oil ) were addressed by using diesel-VO blend with up to 30 % VO by volume . Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry , thermogravimetric analysis , and density , kinematic viscosity , surface tension , and water content measurement were used to characterize the fuel property . The combustion performance of different fuel wa compared experimentally in an atmospheric pressure burner with an air-assist injector and swirling primary air around it . For different fuel , the effect of the atomizing airflow rate on Sauter mean diameter wa determined from a correlation for air-assist atomizer . Profiles of nitric oxide ( NO ( x ) ) and carbon monoxide ( CO ) emission were obtained for different atomizing airflow rate , while the total airflow rate wa kept constant . The result show that despite the compositional difference , the physical property and emission of the two biodiesel fuel are similar . Diesel-VO fuel blend resulted in slightly higher CO emission compared with diesel , while the NO ( x ) emission correlated well with the flame temperature . The result show that the CO and NO ( x ) emission are determined mainly by fuel atomization and fuel/air mixing process , and that the fuel composition effect are of secondary importance for fuel and operating condition of the present study .

aVFuture level in ultraviolet-B ( UVB ) radiation are expected to increase directly due to stratospheric ozone depletion and under water indirectly by , for example , global warming effect on DOC concentration , altered trophic interaction in the plankton , or reduced eutrophication . While detrimental UV effect have been reported at the cellular level , little to nothing is known about community-wide effect of ambient and future UVB radiation . In a 4-month field experiment , the ambient UV regime wa ( i ) reduced by cut-off filter which removed either UVB or total UV from the solar spectrum or ( ii ) increased to predicted future level by UVB lamp . To allow relating the effect of present and future UV regime to another important ecological control of community structure and diversity in subtidal marine habitat , consumer effect were quantified by an exclusion treatment under ambient light regime . Ambient UV regime did not affect community structure , biomass accrual , and diversity . In contrast , under enhanced UVB level , the dominance of the competitively superior blue mussel increased and specie richness and biomass accrual decreased . Species composition of the assemblage differed between the two UV regime . Effects of enhanced UVB radiation and of consumption on biomass accrual , diversity , and structure of the community were comparable in magnitude and timing , but of opposite direction . In contrast , the effect of enhanced UVB radiation on growth and abundance of mussel were in the same direction , but shorter and weaker than consumer effect . Most UV effect were transitory and vanished within the first 2 month of succession . Our result indicate that present and future UVB level may be of limited importance and not stronger in effect size than other ecological control in structuring the shallow-water low-diversity macrobenthic community in temperate region .

aVCoral reef are iconic , threatened ecosystem that have been in existence for similar to 500 million year , yet their continued ecological persistence seems doubtful at present . Anthropogenic modification of chemical and physical atmospheric dynamic that cause coral death by bleaching and newly emergent disease due to increased heat and irradiation , a well a decline in calcification caused by ocean acidification due to increased CO ( 2 ) , are the most important large-scale threat . On more local scale , overfishing and destructive fishery , coastal construction , nutrient enrichment , increased runoff and sedimentation , and the introduction of nonindigenous invasive specie have caused phase shift away from coral . Already similar to 20 % of the world 's reef are lost and similar to 26 % are under imminent threat . Conservation science of coral reef is well advanced , but it practical application ha often been lagging . Societal priorites , economic pressure , and legal/administrative system of many country are more prone to destroy rather than conserve coral-reef ecosystem . Nevertheless , many example of successful conservation exist from the national level to community-enforced local action . When effectively managed , protected area have contributed to regeneration of coral reef and stock of associated marine resource . Local community often support coral-reef conservation in order to raise income potential associated with tourism and/or improved resource level . Coral reef create an annual income in S-Florida alone of over $ 4 billion . Thus , no conflict between development , societal welfare , and coral-reef conservation need to exist . Despite growing threat , it is not too late for decisive action to protect and save these economically and ecologically high-value ecosystem . Conservation science play a critical role in designing effective strategy .

aVWe analyze climate change in a cost-benefit framework , using the emission and concentration profile of Wigley et al . ( Nature 379 ( 6562 ) :240-243 , 1996 ) . They present five scenario that cover the period 1990-2300 and are designed to reach stabilized concentration level of 350 , 450 , 550 , 650 and 750 ppmv , respectively . We assume that the damage cost in each year t is proportional to the corresponding gross world product and the square of the atmospheric temperature increase ( Delta T ( t ) ) . The latter is estimated with a simple two-box model ( representing the atmosphere and deep ocean ) . Coupling the damage cost with the abatement cost , we interpolate between the five scenario to find the one that is optimal in the sense of minimizing the sum of discounted annual ( abatement plus damage ) cost over a time horizon of N year . Our method is simpler than 'traditional ' model with the same purpose , and thus allows for a more transparent sensitivity study with respect to the uncertainty of all parameter involved . We report our central result in term of the stabilized emission level E ( o ) and concentration level p ( o ) ( i.e . their value at t = 300 year ) of the optimal scenario . For the central parameter value ( that is , N = 150 year , a discount rate r ( dis ) = 2 % /year and a growth rate r ( gro ) = 1 % /year of gross world product ) we find E ( o ) = 8.0 GtCO ( 2 ) /year and p ( o ) = 496 ppmv . Varying the parameter over a wide range , we find that the optimal emission level remains within a remarkably narrow range , from about 6.0 to 12 GtCO ( 2 ) /year for all plausible parameter value . To ass the significance of the uncertainty we focus on the social cost penalty , defined a the extra cost incurred by society relative to the optimum if one make the wrong choice of the emission level a a result of erroneous damage and abatement cost estimate . In relative term the cost penalty turn out to be remarkably insensitive to error . For example , if the true damage cost are three time larger or smaller than the estimate , the total social cost of global climate change increase by le than 20 % above it minimum at the true optimal emission level . Because of the enormous magnitude of the total cost involved with climate change ( mitigation ) , however , even a small relative error implies large additional expense in absolute term . To evaluate the benefit of reducing cost uncertainty , we plot the cost penalty a function of the uncertainty in relative damage and abatement cost , expressed a geometric standard deviation and standard deviation respectively . If continued externality analysis reduces the geometric standard deviation of relative damage cost estimate from 5 to 4 , the benefit is 0.05 % of the present value G ( tot ) of total gross word product over 150 year ( about $ 3.9 x 10 ( 15 ) ) , and if further research reduces the standard deviation of relative abatement cost from 1 to 0.5 , the benefit is 0.03 % of G ( tot ) .

aVLife-history theory predict competition and compromise between different reproductive and somatic ( e.g. , growth ) function in plant . This study concern the cost of reproduction in an alpine herb , Parnassia palustris L. , in light of global warming . The field experiment involved manipulation of temperature regime using open top chamber , and manipulation of the current level of reproductive investment by supplemental hand-pollination ( SP ) and bud removal ( BR ) . The study continued for 2 year and cost of reproduction were evaluated in the second year by comparing reproductive output and growth between treatment group . Flower manipulation carried out the first year had no statistically significant effect on reproductive or somatic variable in the second year , which suggests that reproductive cost in P. palustris are limited . Increased temperature , however , had a positive effect on a range of reproductive trait such a seed number , seed mass per fruit , mass per seed , and ratio between reproductive output and growth , but had no statistically significant influence on growth . No statistically significant interaction effect between flower manipulation and warming were revealed , which implies that the effect of flower manipulation in the first year doe not differ statistically significantly between the two temperature regime in the next year . We conclude that the lack of reproductive cost found in P. palustris at Finse express that resource are not restricted under a level that will induce high cost of reproduction . Furthermore , higher temperature do not affect the cost , and finally , it appears that the reproductive cost are fine-tune controlled , which implies optimizing rather than maximizing of reproductive and somatic output .

aVZoige Marsh , located in the Northeastern Qianghai-Tibet Plateau , is the largest highland marsh in the world . The marsh is one of the hotspot for biodiversity , harboring many endemic and endangered specie , including Grus nigricollis , the only plateau crane . Zoige Marsh ha a large area of high-quality grassland , serving a the fifth largest livestock base in China , and it is also the major water source to the headstream of the Yellow River . However , due to global warming and unwise use of the marsh resource , including ditching for grassland enlargement , peat exploitation , and livestock grazing , since the 1970s , Zoige Marsh ha suffered severe ecosystem degradation such a vegetation recessive succession , biodiversity loss , soil deterioration , and rodent disaster . It is therefore imperative to restore the damaged marsh . We propose in this paper that ecological engineering and livestock population control must be taken a measure for ecological restoration and biodiversity protection . ( C ) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

aVThis study assimilates satellite and meteorological data to monitor grain yield and CO ( 2 ) fixation by developing a photosynthetic-sterility model that integrates the Asian scale of meteorological data such a solar radiation , air temperature effect on photosynthesis and the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index ( NDVI ) with a Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre ( SPOT ) VEGETATION sensor . Monitoring crop production using remotely sensed and daily meteorological data can provide an important early warning regarding poor crop production to Asian country with their still-growing population . Grain production monitoring would support orderly crisis management to maintain food security in Asia , which is facing climate fluctuation through this century of global warming . A decision-tree method classifies the distribution of crop field in Asia using Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) and SPOT VEGETATION data , which include the NDVI and Land Surface Water Index ( LSWI ) . The air temperature data are available from the National Centres for Environmental Prediction ( NCEP ) and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ( ECMWF ) . The solar radiation data are supplied by the Geostationary Meteorological Satellite ( GMS ) Centre and re-analysis data , by the NCEP and ECMWF . This study provides daily distribution of the photosynthesis rate , which is the CO ( 2 ) fixation in Asian area combined with the distribution of grain field .

aVTwo main mechanism can potentially explain the spread in the magnitude of global warming simulated by climate model : deep ocean heat uptake and climate feedback . Here , we show that deep oceanic heat uptake is a major source of spread in simulation of 21st century climate change . Models with deeper baseline polar mixed layer are associated with larger deep ocean warming and smaller global surface warming . Based on this result , we set forth an observational constraint on polar vertical oceanic mixing . This constraint suggests that many model may overestimate the efficiency of polar oceanic mixing and therefore may underestimate future surface warming . Thus to reduce climate change uncertainty at time-scales relevant for policy-making , improved understanding and modelling of oceanic mixing at high latitude is crucial . Citation : Boe , J. , A .

aVThe UN decision to couple 'deserts ' and 'desertification ' in addressing the year 2006 ( a well a the following decade ) a 'Year ( or Decade ) of Deserts and Desertification ' sends several wrong message regarding both the nature of desert a natural ecosystem and of desertification a a human-driven process that reduces the provision of ecosystem service of soil conservation and of biological productivity , specifically in non-desert area , more than in desert one . A new approach to addressing sustainable development in the drylands wa presented in an international conference that took place at the end of the 'International Year ' and hosted by the Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research in Sede Boqer , Israel . This approach ( a ) qualifies drylands a ecosystem whose biological productivity is constrained by water and hence it is naturally low compared to that of most other terrestrial ecosystem ; ( b ) qualifies desertification a a further persistent reduction of productivity in the drylands brought about mainly through human impact mostly driven by population increase ; ( c ) observes that within the drylands natural productivity linearly decline with aridity , and Suggests that sensitivity to impact linearly increase with aridity ; ( d ) further Suggests that population density generates the impact , and observes that population density in drylands increase exponentially a aridity decline ; and ( e ) Suggests that the product of the linear sensitivity and the exponential impact generates a desertification peak at the transition between non-desert drylands ( where desertification and poverty are high ) and the desert drylands ( where both are very low ) . Given these , the Sede Boqer approach suggests that ( a ) rather than be construed a all adversity , desert drylands offer opportunity to their inhabitant since their environmental condition are conducive for livelihood mostly independent of the desert 's very low productivity ; this includes solar energy development and tourism , but also ( counterintuitively ! ) desert aquaculture ; ( b ) non-desert drylands , on the other hand , face a serious challenge of becoming desertified , mainly due to increasing populatiom and ( c ) global climate change further increase the success of alternative livelihood in desert , may create opportunity in some of the non-desert drylands too , but amplifies the challenge facing non-esert drylands people . Caution and prudence are required to meet these challenge , especially since currently socio-political measure are in shorter supply than technological fix .

aVAn improved chemical oxidation pretreatment method ha been developed for the determination of elemental carbon ( EC ) [ also known a black carbon ( BC ) or soot ] in lake sediment , using a thermal-optical transmittance ( TOT ) carbon analyzer . The method employ six step : ( 1 ) removal of carbonate by treatment with HCl ; ( 2 ) removal of silicate by treatment with HF + HCl ; ( 3 ) removal of any remaining carbonate by treatment with HCl : ( 4 ) removal of humic acid by treatment with NaOH ; and ( 5 ) oxidation of kerogens by K ( 2 ) Cr ( 2 ) O ( 7 ) + H ( 2 ) SO ( 4 ) . A critical step of zinc chloride treatment wa added : this apparently change EC 's morphology and enhances retention on quartz fiber filter , resulting in several-fold increased chemical yield . EC wa determined using the TOT method with modified combustion timing . Carbon black ( acetylene ) and four NIST standard reference material ( SRMs ) were used for quality control , and to ass the precision of the analysis . The EC recovery from 18 carbon black sample varied from 90 to 111 % , with a mean value of 99 +/- 6 % . The high EC recovery confirmed the validity of the method . Char reference material ( i.e . chestnut wood and grass char ) were used to determine potential contribution to EC in our measurement . The char reference containing about 700 mg total organic carbon ( OC ) contributed similar to 1.5 % EC . The measured EC value from four NIST standard were 17.0 +/- 0.6 , 24.2 +/- 3.2 , 5.6. and 1.9 +/- 0.1 mg g ( dw ) ( -1 ) for SRM-1648 , SRM-1649a , SRM-1941b and SRM-8704 , respectively . These value in SRMs were in agreement ( < +/- 4 % ) with the previously reported value . The method wa applied to determine the EC in sediment core from an urban lake and a remote mountain lake in the Northeastern United States . The EC concentration in two lake mimic the model EC emission from the industrial revolution in United States . ( C ) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVThe simple model wa developed to estimate daily evapotranspiration ( ET ) by using Terra-MODIS remotely sensed data . The satellite ET model wa based on the Hargreaves model which requires only two climatic variable ; temperature and incident solar radiation . By using the satellite ET model , temperature in term of LST ( RS ) wa directly calculated from brightness temperature of MODIS channel 31 and 32 ; while incident solar radiation in term of APAR ( RS ) wa calculated from NDVI ( RS ) computed from reflectance of MODIS channel 1 and 2 . ET calibrated from the model wa experimented to ass sensitivity of ET on rice grown under increased temperature ( 2 degree C. ) The result showed that modeled ET had a good agreement with Penman-based ET , a typical model widely used for estimating irrigated water supply . ET ( RS ) model showed a better correlation with LST ( RS ' ) compared to that with NDVI ( RS ) . The experimental pot result showed that ET amount based on developed model wa sufficient for water consumption of rice . ET computed from the model ranged from 3.43 to 5.56 mm/day . However , from rice 's height and leaf area growth data , it wa found that the optimal amount of water supply wa between 3.65-4.57 mm/day , indicating 6-17 % error of the developed model .

We argue that by combining these , in fact , complementary measure , it is possible to address the crucial issue of renewable generation-fluctuating supply-in a comprehensive a well a in a technologically and economically viable manner .

Zoological Studies 48 ( 2 ) : 174-183 . The rainfall regime of the Pampas region of Argentina ha increased over it historical mean during the last several decade . In this paper we used the unusually rainy year of 2002 to explore possible effect on the abundance and diversity of terrestrial arthropod due to reduction in suitable coastal marsh habitat due to flooding in the eastern Pampas . We assessed 1 ) the effect of change in monthly cumulative rainfall total on habitat availability and diversity , 2 ) the impact of change in habitat availability and diversity on ground arthropod , particularly on beetle specie , and 3 ) arthropod response to change in habitat availability according to their dispersal ability , and among beetle specie , according to their habitat specialization and trophic group . The increase in rain reduced the areal extent of terrestrial habitat through flooding , and a a consequence , reduced habitat diversity . These change at the landscape level influenced the abundance and diversity of arthropod ( assessed by pitfall trap ) . The most affected specie were those with poor dispersal capability , which may have been due to their weaker ability to expand their home range . The most affected among beetle specie were those that are habitat specialist , which may have been due to shift in the habitat to which they are adapted , and at higher trophic level , an indirect effect , in term of habitat loss , of a reduction in prey availability wa added .

aVThe Paleocene/Eocene Thermal Maximum ( PETM , ca . 55 Ma ) is an abrupt , profound perturbation of climate and the carbon cycle associated with a massive injection of isotopically light carbon into the ocean-atmosphere system . As such , it provides an analogue for understanding the interplay between phytoplankton and climate under modern anthropogenic global-warming condition . However , the accompanying enhanced dissolution pose uncertainty on the reconstruction of the affected ecology and productivity . We present a high-resolution record of bulk isotope and nannofossil absolute abundance from Ocean Drilling Program ( ODP ) Site 1135 on the Kerguelen Plateau , Southern Indian Ocean to quantitatively constrain for the first time the influence of dissolution on paleoecological reconstruction . Our bulk-carbonate , isotope record closely resembles that of the classic PETM site at ODP Site 690 on the opposite side of the Antarctic continent , and it correlation with those from ODP Sites 690 , 1262 and 1263 record allows recognition of 14 precessional cycle upsection from the onset of the carbon isotopic excursion ( CIE ) . This , together with a full range of common Discoaster araneus and an abundance crossover between Fasciculithus and Zygrhablithus bijugatus , indicates the presence of the PETM at Site 1135 , a poorly known record with calcareous fossil throughout the interval . The strong correlation between the absolute abundance of Chiasmolithus and coccolith assemblage reveals a dominant paleoecological signal in the poorly preserved fossil assemblage , while the influence of dissolution is only strong during the CIE . This suggests that r-selected taxon can preserve faithful ecological information even in the severely-altered assemblage studied here , and therefore provide a strong case for the application of nannofossils to paleoecological study in better-preserved PETM section . The inferred nannoplankton productivity drop abruptly at the CIE onset , but rapidly increase after the CIE peak , both of which may be driven by nutrient availability related to ocean stratification and vertical mixing due to changed sea-surface temperature .

aVAnimal wastewater lagoon nearby concentrated animal feeding operation ( CAFOs ) represent the latest tendency in global animal farming , severely impacting the magnitude of greenhouse gas emission , including nitrous oxide ( N ( 2 ) O ) . We hypothesized that lagoon wastewater could be supersaturated with N ( 2 ) O a part of incomplete microbial nitrification/denitrification process , thereby regulating the N ( 2 ) O partitioning in the gaseous phase . The objective of this study were : ( i ) to investigate the magnitude of dissolved N ( 2 ) O concentration in the lagoon ; and ( ii ) to determine the extent to which supersaturation of N ( 2 ) O occurs in wastewater lagoon . Dissolved N ( 2 ) O concentration in the wastewater sample were high , ranging from 0.4 to 40.5 mu g N ( 2 ) O mL ( -1 ) . Calculated dissolved N ( 2 ) O concentration from the experimentally measured partition coefficient were much greater than those typically expected in aquatic system ( < similar to 0.6 mu g N ( 2 ) O mL ( -1 ) ) . Knowledge of the factor controlling the magnitude of N ( 2 ) O supersaturation could potentially bridge mass balance difference between in situ measurement and global N ( 2 ) O model .

aVRegional climate projection using climate model commonly use an `` all-model '' ensemble based on data set such a the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 's ( IPCC ) 4th Assessment ( AR4 ) . Some regional assessment have omitted model based on specific criterion . We use a criterion based on the capacity of climate model to simulate the observed probability density function calculated using daily data , model-by-model and region-by-region for each of the AR4 model over Australia . We demonstrate that by omitting those climate model with relatively weak skill in simulating the observed probability density function of maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation , different regional projection are obtained . Differences include : larger increase in the mean maximum and mean minimum temperature , but smaller increase in the annual maximum and minimum temperature . There is little impact on mean precipitation but the better model simulate a larger increase in the annual rainfall event combined with a larger decrease in the number of rain day . The weaker model bias the amount of mean warming towards lower increase , bias annual maximum temperature to excessive warming and bias precipitation such that the amount of the annual rainfall event is under-estimated . We suggest that omitting weak model from regional scale estimate of future climate change help clarify the nature and scale of the projected impact of global warming .

aVGlobal climate change may induce accelerated soil organic matter ( SOM ) decomposition through increased soil temperature , and thus impact the C balance in soil . We hypothesized that compartmentalization of substrate and decomposers in the soil matrix would decrease SOM sensitivity to temperature . We tested our hypothesis with three short-term laboratory incubation with differing physical protection treatment conducted at different temperature . Overall , CO ( 2 ) efflux increased with temperature , but response among physical protection treatment were not consistently different . Similar respiration quotient ( Q ( 10 ) ) value across physical protection treatment did not support our original hypothesis that the largest Q ( 10 ) value would be observed in the treatment with the least physical protection . Compartmentalization of substrate and decomposers is known to reduce the decomposability of otherwise labile material , but the hypothesized attenuation of temperature sensitivity wa not detected , and thus the sensitivity is probably driven by the thermodynamics of biochemical reaction a expressed by Arrhenius-type equation .

aVBackground : Coral reef around the world are experiencing large-scale degradation , largely due to global climate change , overfishing , disease and eutrophication . Climate change model suggest increasing frequency and severity of warming-induced coral bleaching event , with consequent increase in coral mortality and algal overgrowth . Critically , the recovery of damaged reef will depend on the reversibility of seaweed bloom , generally considered to depend on grazing of the seaweed , and replenishment of coral by larva that successfully recruit to damaged reef . These process usually take year to decade to bring a reef back to coral dominance . Methodology/Principal Findings : In 2006 , mass bleaching of coral on inshore reef of the Great Barrier Reef caused high coral mortality . Here we show that this coral mortality wa followed by an unprecedented bloom of a single specie of unpalatable seaweed ( Lobophora variegata ) , colonizing dead coral skeleton , but that coral on these reef recovered dramatically , in le than a year . Unexpectedly , this rapid reversal did not involve reestablishment of coral by recruitment of coral larva , a often assumed , but depended on several ecological mechanism previously underestimated . Conclusions/Significance : These mechanism of ecological recovery included rapid regeneration rate of remnant coral tissue , very high competitive ability of the coral allowing them to out-compete the seaweed , a natural seasonal decline in the particular specie of dominant seaweed , and an effective marine protected area system . Our study provides a key example of the doom and boom of a highly resilient reef , and new insight into the variability and mechanism of reef resilience under rapid climate change .

aVWe review how the renormalized force correlator Delta ( u ) , the function computed in the functional renormalization-group ( RG ) field theory , can be measured directly in numerics and experiment on the dynamic of elastic manifold in the presence of pinning disorder . We show how this function can be computed analytically for a particle dragged through a one-dimensional random-force landscape . The limit of small velocity allows one to access the critical behavior at the depinning transition . For uncorrelated force one find three universality class , corresponding to the three extreme value statistic , Gumbel , Weibull , and Frechet . For each class we obtain analytically the universal function Delta ( u ) , the correction to the critical force , and the joint probability distribution of avalanche size s and waiting time w. We find P ( s ) =P ( w ) for all three case . All result are checked numerically . For a Brownian force landscape , known a the Alessandro , Beatrice , Bertotti , and Montorsi ( ABBM ) model , avalanche distribution and Delta ( u ) can be computed for any velocity . For two-dimensional disorder , we perform large-scale numerical simulation to calculate the renormalized force correlator tensor Delta ( ij ) ( u ) , and to extract the anisotropic scaling exponent zeta ( x ) > zeta ( y ) . We also show how the Middleton theorem is violated . Our result are relevant for the record statistic of random sequence with linear trend , a encountered , e.g. , in some model of global warming . We give the joint distribution of the time s between two successive record and their difference in value w .

aVDespite a growing appreciation of the need to protect sensitive deep sea ecosystem such a cold-water coral , effort to map the extent of their distribution are limited by their remoteness . Here we develop ecological niche model to predict the likely distribution of cold-water coral based on occurrence record and data describing environmental parameter ( e.g . seafloor terrain attribute and oceanographic condition ) . This study ha used bathymetric data derived from ship-borne multibeam swath system , specie occurrence data from remotely operated vehicle video survey and oceanographic parameter from hydrodynamic model to predict coral location in region where there is a paucity of direct observation . Predictions of the location of the scleractinian coral , Lophelia pertusa are based primarily upon ecological niche modelling using a genetic algorithm . Its accuracy ha been quantified at local ( similar to 25 km ( 2 ) ) and regional scale ( similar to 4000 km ( 2 ) ) along the Irish continental slope using a variety of error assessment technique and a comparison with another ecological niche modelling technique . With appropriate choice of parameter and scale of analysis , ecological niche modelling ha been effective in predicting the distribution of specie at local and regional scale . Refinements of this approach have the potential to be particularly useful for ocean management given the need to manage area of sensitive habitat where survey data are often limited .

aVThe aim of the present work wa the assessment of economic and environmental aspect of decentralized energy-saving wastewater treatment system . The formulated investment and operation cost function were adjusted by a power law function . The different wastewater system serving population settlement between 50 p.e . and 250 p.e. , presented associated investment cost varying from ( sic ) 400/p.e . to ( sic ) 200/p.e . and annual operation cost in the range of ( sic ) 70/p.e.- ( sic ) 20/p.e. , respectively . A life cycle analysis approach wa used to compare the environmental impact of alternative wastewater treatment system . The assessment wa focused on two energy-saving system ( constructed wetland and slow rate infiltration ) and a conventional one ( activated sludge process ) . Low environmental impact of energy-saving wastewater treatment system wa demonstrated , being the most relevant the global warming indicator . Options for reduction of life cycle impact were assessed including material used in construction and operation lifetime of the system . A 10 % extension of operation lifetime of constructed wetland and slow rate infiltration system lead to a 5 % and 7 % decrease in the abiotic depletion indicator , respectively , and to a 1 % decrease in CO ( 2 ) emission in both system . Replacing steel with HDPE in the activated sludge tank resulted in a 1 % reduction in CO ( 2 ) emission and 1 % in the abiotic depletion indicator . In the case of the Imhoff tank a 1 % reduction in CO ( 2 ) emission and 5 % in abiotic depletion indicator were observed when concrete wa replaced by HDPE . Therefore , considering the huge potential of energy saving wastewater treatment system , the overall environmental impact of such design alternative should not be discarded .

aVCarbon dioxide ( CO ( 2 ) ) is a greenhouse gas that make by far the largest contribution to the global warming of the Earth 's atmosphere . For the measurement of atmospheric CO ( 2 ) a non-dispersive infrared analyzer ( NDIR ) and gas chromatography are conventionally being used . We explored whether and to what degree argon content can influence the determination of atmospheric CO ( 2 ) using the comparison of CO ( 2 ) concentration between the sample gas mixture with varying At amount at 0 and 18.6 mmol mol ( -1 ) and the calibration gas mixture with Ar at 8.4 , 9.1 , and 9.3 mmol mol ( -1 ) . We newly discovered that variation of At content in calibration gas mixture could undermine accuracy for precise and accurate determination of atmospheric CO ( 2 ) in background air . The difference in CO ( 2 ) concentration due to the variation of Ar content in the calibration gas mixture were negligible ( < +/-0.03 mu mol mol ( -1 ) ) for NDIR system whereas they noticeably increased ( < +/-1.09 mu mol mol ( -1 ) ) especially for the modified GC system to enhance instrumental sensitivity . We found that the thermal mass flow controller is the main source of the difference although such difference appeared only in the presence of a flow restrictor in GC system . For reliable monitoring of real atmospheric CO ( 2 ) sample , one should use calibration gas mixture that contain At content close to the level ( 9.332 mmol mol ( -1 ) ) in the ambient air a possible . Practical guideline were highlighted relating to selection of appropriate analytical approach for the accurate and precise measurement of atmospheric CO ( 2 ) . In addition , theoretical implication from the finding were addressed . ( C ) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All right reserved .

aVWith reference to massive outbreak of a variety of bark beetle occurring across the forest of western North America , it is stressed that an accurate assessment of the extent of the problem is the first step toward formulating effective adaptive management strategy . This assessment will only be possible through a coordinated effort that combine all available technology , that is an approach that build on satellite image analysis , aerial survey from fixed-wing aircraft , and on the ground observation and measurement .

aVDiverse fish assemblage should feature a range of biological and ecological response to temperature change . Using preliminary bioenergetics model , I simulated growth and maturation of three California Current groundfish ( yelloweye rockfish ( Sebastes ruberrimus ) , sablefish ( Anoplopoma fimbria ) , and spiny dogfish ( Squalus acanthias ) ) at fixed temperature ranging from 5 degree C to 11 degree C. I examined three response variable ( size at age 1 ( W ( 1 ) ) , age at 50 % maturity ( tau ( 50 % ) ) , and total prey consumption ( C ) ) . Yelloweye rockfish responded most strongly for W ( 1 ) , which increased 496 % a temperature increased from 5 degree C to 11 degree C. Spiny dogfish t50 % wa highly sensitive , declining from > 48 year at 5 degree C to < 13 year at 11 degree C. Age-specific C wa most responsive in yelloweye rockfish , increasing by more than fivefold over the range of temperature , although sablefish likely have greater community-wide impact because their trophic level and absolute feeding rate are higher . Regime shift , temperature anomaly , or global climate change may directly affect fish energy budget , elicit range shift , or produce complex ecological interaction . Studies like this will help manager to identify temperature-sensitive specie and anticipate potential change in population and diverse community .

aVEl Nino event , characterized by anomalous warming in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean , have global climatic teleconnections and are the most dominant feature of cyclic climate variability on subdecadal timescales . Understanding change in the frequency or characteristic of El Nino event in a changing climate is therefore of broad scientific and socioeconomic interest . Recent study ( 1-5 ) show that the canonical El Nino ha become le frequent and that a different kind of El Nino ha become more common during the late twentieth century , in which warm sea surface temperature ( SSTs ) in the central Pacific are flanked on the east and west by cooler SSTs . This type of El Nino , termed the central Pacific El Nino ( CP-El Nino ; also termed the dateline El Nino ( 2 ) , El Nino Modoki ( 3 ) or warm pool El Nino ( 5 ) ) , differs from the canonical eastern Pacific El Nino ( EP-El Nino ) in both the location of maximum SST anomaly and tropical-midlatitude teleconnections . Here we show change in the ratio of CP-El Nino to EP-El Nino under projected global warming scenario from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 multi-model data set ( 6 ) . Using calculation based on historical El Nino index , we find that projection of anthropogenic climate change are associated with an increased frequency of the CP-El Nino compared to the EP-El Nino . When restricted to the six climate model with the best representation of the twentieth-century ratio of CP-El Nino to EP-El Nino , the occurrence ratio of CP-El Nino/EP-El Nino is projected to increase a much a five time under global warming . The change is related to a flattening of the thermocline in the equatorial Pacific .

aVThe El Nino/Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) phenomenon , originating in the Tropical Pacific , is the strongest natural interannual climate signal and ha widespread effect on the global climate system and the ecology of the Tropical Pacific . Any strong change in ENSO statistic will therefore have serious climatic and ecological consequence . Most global climate model do simulate ENSO , although large bias exist with respect to it characteristic . The ENSO response to global warming differs strongly from model to model and is thus highly uncertain . Some model simulate an increase in ENSO amplitude , others a decrease , and others virtually no change . Extremely strong change constituting tipping point behavior are not simulated by any of the model . Nevertheless , some interesting change in ENSO dynamic can be inferred from observation and model integration . Although no tipping point behavior is envisaged in the physical climate system , smooth transition in it may give rise to tipping point behavior in the biological , chemical , and even socioeconomic system . For example , the simulated weakening of the Pacific zonal sea surface temperature gradient in the Hadley Centre model ( with dynamic vegetation included ) caused rapid Amazon forest die-back in the mid-twenty-first century , which in turn drove a nonlinear increase in atmospheric CO ( 2 ) , accelerating global warming .

aVEnvironmental and social stress have major impact on the life cycle of organism . Furthermore , habitat disturbance/destruction , global climate change , and existence of endocrine disrupting chemical ( EDCs ) due to human activity are increasingly likely to pose additive and synergistic stress that could have potential deleterious effect on physiological function in vertebrate . Central to an organism 's life cycle is the ability to respond to environmental cue , physical and social . Environmental signal may act directly on endocrine tissue , but most act through neural pathway , and neuroendocrine and endocrine secretion that affect change in morphology , physiology and behavior . While most investigation focus on endocrine secretion and their effect , we know much le about perception and transduction of environmental signal . Additionally , some population of vertebrate , from fish to mammal , temporarily resist environmental and social stress , and breed successfully . However , many show varying degree of failure , sometimes resulting in marked population decline . There is potential for EDCs to act at all level of the response system to environmental cue . Because animal live in diverse habitat , there is variation in susceptibility to disruption of response system to environmental cue . Although this may be partly due to genetic difference at a level of receptor and/or metabolism , fundamental difference in how specie perceive environmental cue and respond to them may also be major factor . Here we discus how EDCs may interact with the perception and transduction of environmental cue that are important for all organism in their natural world . This may introduce a new perspective on the effect of environmental endocrine disruptors . ( C ) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All right reserved .

aVOne of the most important source of global carbon dioxide emission is the combustion of fossil fuel for power generation . Power plant contribute more than 40 % of the worldwide anthropogenic CO ( 2 ) emission . Therefore , the increased requirement for climate protection are a great challenge for the power producer . In this context a significant increase in power plant efficiency will contribute to reduce specific CO ( 2 ) emission . Additionally , CO ( 2 ) capture and storage ( CCS ) is receiving considerable attention a a greenhouse gas ( GHG ) mitigation option . CCS allows continued use of fossil fuel with no or little CO ( 2 ) emission given to the atmosphere . This could approve a moderate transition to a low-carbon energy generation over the next decade . Currently , R & D activity in the field of CCS are mainly concentrated on the development of capture technique , the geological assessment of CO ( 2 ) storage reservoir , and on economic aspect . Although first study on material and energy flow caused by CCS are available , a broader environmental analysis is necessary to show the overall environmental impact of CCS . The objective in this paper are coal-based power plant with and without CO ( 2 ) capture via mono-ethanolamine ( MEA ) and the comparison of their environmental effect based on life cycle assessment methodology ( LCA ) . This LCA study examines the environmental and human health effect of power generation of five coal-based steam power plant , which differ in the year of installation ( 2005 , 2010 , 2020 ) , the conversion efficiency , and in the ability and efficiency to capture CO ( 2 ) . For the removal of CO ( 2 ) from combustion and gasification process in power plant , three main technology concept exist : ( 1 ) pre-combustion technology , ( 2 ) oxyfuel combustion system , and ( 3 ) post-combustion separation . As post-combustion technology show the highest level of maturity , this study concentrate on this route , focusing on capture using mono-ethanolamine ( MEA ) . The analysis regard the post-combustion retrofit of coal power plant with MEA to be a general option in 2020 . Material and energy flow are balanced on the level of single process a well a for the whole process chain . The life cycle inventory clearly show decreasing input and output according to the efficiency increase from 43 % to 49 % in case of the power plant without CO ( 2 ) capture . In case of the MEA plant , all input and emission raise , according to the additional energy consumption , except CO ( 2 ) and sulphur dioxide . The strong decrease of SO ( 2 ) partly result from the necessary improvement of desulphurisation if MEA wash is used . The influence of up and downstream activity on the result is determined . For the MEA plant , a considerable effect of up and downstream activity on the overall result is observed . Finally , the inventory result are assigned to selected impact category . Global warming ( GWP ) , human toxicity ( HTP ) , acidification ( AP ) , photo-oxidant formation ( POCP ) , eutrophication ( EP ) , and primary energy demand are adopted a impact category . The impact assessment indicates decreasing impact for all category with increasing combustion efficiency for the coal plant without carbon capture . As expected , the GWP for the MEA plant is much lower than for the power plant without CO ( 2 ) capture . In contrast to this , the HTP and the EP are much higher ( up to three time ) for the MEA plant . Sensitivity analysis reveals that the origin of coal and the corresponding transport distance have a significant impact on the overall result . Furthermore , it is concluded from the sensitivity analysis that for CCS system the length of CO ( 2 ) pipeline ha a negligible effect in comparison with the effect of capture efficiency . The LCA is completed by a normalisation of the environmental impact category . The development of combustion efficiency in case of the power plant without CO ( 2 ) capture ha the main influence on the decreasing mass flow at the input side . The energy penalty of the MEA plant affect the use of the input into the opposite direction . Although the power producer 's focus is on the power plant , the sense of a life cycle assessment is an integrated environmental assessment of the full life cycle of a product ( here 1 kWh ) including up and downstream process . Therefore , the inventory result are presented without and with up and downstream process . The inventory analysis clearly show the significant influence of the up and downstream process on the overall emission . This influence is higher for the MEA plant than for the power plant without capture . In case of CO ( 2 ) emission , the significance of up and downstream process is especially considerable ( approx . 30 % ) . Sensitivity analysis reveals that the origin of coal and the corresponding transport distance have a significant impact on the overall result . The result point out that the reduction of carbon dioxide emission into the atmosphere is achieved at the expense of increasing other emission and corresponding environmental impact . In most case the influence of up and downstream process is significant . Therefore , life cycle approach are necessary to get a holistic evaluation . It also show that the implementation of new technique can change the environmental assessment of the process chain and , thus , positive and negative effect have to be compared and weighed up against each other . As there exist several possible technical option for CO ( 2 ) capture , further study are necessary to compare the overall environmental effect of competing capture concept such a pre-combustion and oxyfuel technology . Additionally , gas separating membrane should be part of further study a they have the potential to contribute to all three main capture technology route . Further study with more detail and reliable inventory for CO ( 2 ) compression and liquefaction a well a for gas conditioning a an interface between CO ( 2 ) capture and transport are needed . Furthermore , the environmental effect including long-term CO ( 2 ) emission from the storage site are recommended .

aVBioenergetics model is applied to Japanese common squid , Todarodes pacificus . The temporal change of wet weight of common squid , which migrates in the Sea of Japan , is simulated . The time dependent horizontal distribution of prey is calculated a priori by 3-D coupled physical-biological model . The biological model NEMURO ( North Pacific Ecosystem Model for Understanding Regional Oceanography ) is used to simulate the lower-trophic ecosystem including three kind of zooplankton biomass two of which is used a prey of common squid . A bioenergetics model reproduced appropriate growth curve of common squid , migrating in the North Pacific and the Sea of Japan . The result show that the wet weight of common squid in the northern Sea of Japan is heavier than that migrating in the central Sea of Japan , because prey density of the northern Sea of Japan is higher than that of the central Sea of Japan . We also investigate the wet weight anomaly for a global warming scenario . In this case . wet weight of common squid decrease because water temperature exceeds the optimum temperature for common squid . This result indicates that migration route and spawning area of common squid might change with global warming . ( C ) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All right reserved .

aVGrowing public concern about the traceability , safety and environmental-friendliness of food product provide an incentive for shorter supply chain in agricultural production . Here , we assessed the environmental impact of the substitution of imported soybean meal with locally-produced rapeseed meal in French dairy production system , using a life-cycle approach . Two feeding ration based on either French-produced rapeseed meal or Brazilian-produced soy meal a concentrate , were compared for nine impact category , including global warming , ecotoxicity and eutrophication . Crop production wa the main contributor to most impact . while overseas transport of soy meal only had a marginal effect . The `` Soybean '' ration appeared more environmentally-efficient than the `` Rapeseed '' ration because it involved le intensive management practice , in particular regarding synthetic fertilizer consumption . However , land use change brought about by soybean cultivation should also be examined . ( C ) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVResponding to the challenge posed by global warming , peak oil and biofuels will require a paradigm shift in the practice of agriculture and in the role of live stock within the farming system . Farming system should aim at maximizing plant biomass production from locally available diversified resource , processing of the biomass on farm to provide food , feed and energy and recycling of all waste material . The approach that is the subject of this paper is that the generation of electricity can be a by-product of food/feed production . The concept is the fractionation of biomass into inedible cell wall material that can be converted to an inflammable gas by gasification , the gas in turn being the source of fuel for internal combustion engine driving electrical generator . The cell content and related structure such a tree leaf are used a human food or animal feed . As well a providing food and feed the model is highly appropriate for decentralized small scale production of electricity in rural area . It also offer opportunity for sequestration of carbon in the form of biochar the solid residue remaining after gasification of the biomass .

aVThe strength of the water vapor feedback ha been estimated by analyzing the change in tropospheric specific humidity during El Nino-Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) cycle . This analysis is done in climate model driven by observed sea surface temperature [ Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project ( AMIP ) run ] , preindustrial run of fully coupled climate model , and in two reanalysis product , the 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Re-Analysis ( ERA-40 ) and the NASA Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications ( MERRA ) . The water vapor feedback during ENSO-driven climate variation in the AMIP model range from 1.9 to 3.7 W m ( -2 ) K ( -1 ) , in the control run it range from 1.4 to 3.9 W m ( -2 ) K ( -1 ) , and in the ERA-40 and MERRA it is 3.7 and 4.7 W m ( -2 ) K ( -1 ) , respectively . Taken a a group , these value are higher than previous estimate of the water vapor feedback in response to century-long global warming . Also examined is the reason for the large spread in the ENSO-driven water vapor feedback among the model and between the model and the reanalyses . The model and the reanalyses show a consistent relationship between the variation in the tropical surface temperature over an ENSO cycle and the radiative response to the associated change in specific humidity . However , the feedback is defined a the ratio of the radiative response to the change in the global average temperature . Differences in extratropical temperature will , therefore , lead to different inferred feedback , and this is the root cause of spread in feedback observed here . This is also the likely reason that the feedback inferred from ENSO is larger than for long-term global warming .

aVEnsemble numerical experiment with the climate model of intermediate complexity developed at the A.M. Obukhov Institute of Atmospheric Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences ( IAP RAS CM ) are conducted to estimate the efficiency of controlled climate forcing ( geoengineering ) due to stratospheric sulfate aerosol ( SSA ) emission in order to compensate for global warming under the SRES A1B anthropogenic emission scenario . Full ( or even excessive ) compensation for the expected anthropogenic warming in the model is possible with sufficiently intense geoengineering . For ensemble member with value of the governing parameter corresponding to those obtained for the Mt . Pinatubo eruption , global warming is reduced by no more than 0.46 K in the second half of the 21st century , with a residual rise in the global surface temperature T ( g ) comparative to 1961-1990 of 1.0-1.2 K by 2050 and 1.9-2.2 K by 2100 . The largest reduction in global warming ( with the other parameter of the numerical experiment being equal ) is found not for a meridional distribution of SSA concentration peaked at low latitude ( despite the largest ( in magnitude ) global compensation instantaneous radiative forcing ) , but for a uniform horizontal aerosol distribution and for a distribution with the SSA concentration maximum in the middle and subpolar latitude of the Northern Hemisphere . The efficiency of geoengineering in term of T ( g ) in the second half of the 21st century between the most efficient and the least efficient meridional distribution of stratospheric aerosol differs by a much a one-third , depending on the value of other governing parameter . For meridional distribution of SSA concentration , which produce the largest deceleration of global warming , such a deceleration is regionally most pronounced over high- and subpolarlatitude land area and in the Arctic . In particular , this is expressed in the smallest reduction in the sea-ice extent and permafrost area under climate warming in the model . The compensation forcing also decelerates a general increase in global annual precipitation P ( g ) during warming . The relative deceleration in precipitation increase is most pronounced in land region outside the tropic , where a significant deficit in precipitation is currently observed . After the theoretical completion of geoengineering in the first or second decade , it temperature effect vanishes with an abrupt acceleration of global and regional surface warming . For individual member of the ensemble experiment , the global temperature change in this period is five time a large a that in the experiment without geoengineering and ten time a large regionally ( in northeastern Siberia ) .

aVThe greenhouse gas emission ( total greenhouse gas , CO2 , CO , SO2 , NO2 , E ( emission of non-methane volatile organic compound ) ) covered by the Kyoto Protocol are weighted by their global warming potential and aggregated to give total emission in CO2 equivalent . The subject in this study is to obtain equation to predict the greenhouse gas emission of Turkey using energy and economic indicator by the artificial neural network approach . In this study , three different model were used in order to train the artificial neural network . In the first of them sectoral energy consumption ( Model 1 ) , in the second of them gross domestic product ( Model 2 ) , and in the third of them gross national product ( Model 3 ) are used input layer of the network . The greenhouse gas emission are in the output layer for all model . The aim of using different model is to estimate the greenhouse gas emission with high confidence to make correct investment in Turkey . The obtained equation are used to determine the future level of the greenhouse gas emission and take measure to control the share of sector in total emission . According to artificial neural network result , the maximum mean absolute percentage error for Model 1 were found to be 0.147151 , 0.066716 , 0.181901 , 0.105146 , 0.124684 , and 0.158157 for greenhouse gas , SO2 , NO2 , CO , E , and CO2 , about training data with Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm by eight neuron , respectively . Similarly , for Model 2 these value were found to be 0.487212 , 0.701938 , 0.718754 , 0.232667 , 0.272346 , and 0.575421 , respectively . And finally , for Model 3 , these value were found to be 0.126728 , 0.115135 , 0.069296 , 0.214888 , 0.080358 , and 0.179481 , respectively . R2 value are obtained very close to 1 for all model . The artificial neural network approach show greater accuracy for estimating the greenhouse gas emission .

aVMethane ( CH ( 4 ) ) , which is one of the most abundant anthropogenic greenhouse gas , is produced from landfill . CH ( 4 ) is biologically oxidized to carbon dioxide , which ha a lower global warming potential than methane , when it pass through a cover soil . In order to quantify the amount of CH ( 4 ) oxidized in a landfill cover soil , a soil column test , a diffusion cell test , and a mathematical model analysis were carried out . In the column test , maximum oxidation rate of CH ( 4 ) ( V ( max ) ) showed higher value in the upper part of the column than those in the lower part caused by the penetration of O ( 2 ) from the top . The organic matter content in the upper area wa also higher due to the active microbial growth . The dispersion analysis result for O ( 2 ) and CH ( 4 ) in the column are counter-intuitive . As the upward flow rate of the landfill gas increased , the dispersion coefficient of CH ( 4 ) Slightly increased , possibly due to the effect of mechanical dispersion . On the other hand , a the upward flow rate of the landfill gas increased , the dispersion coefficient of O ( 2 ) decreased . It is possible that the diffusion of gas in porous medium is influenced by the counter-directional flow rate . Further analysis of other gas in the column , N ( 2 ) and CO ( 2 ) , may be required to support this hypothesis , but in this paper we propose the possibility that the simulation using the diffusion coefficient of O ( 2 ) under the natural condition may overestimate the penetration of O ( 2 ) into the soil cover layer and consequently overestimate the oxidation of CH ( 4 ) .

aVThe Mississippi River floodplain in northwestern Mississippi and eastern Arkansas , often referred to a the Mississippi Delta , is extremely important for regional economic stability and growth due to the widespread agriculture in the area . Precipitation is often the limiting factor in crop production , and thus knowledge of precipitation variability is essential . The region is unique in currently having three source of precipitation observation : ( 1 ) multi-sensor precipitation estimate from the National Weather Service ( NWS ) NEXRAD network ; ( 2 ) surface observation from NWS recording station ; and ( 3 ) surface observation from U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) Soil Climate Analysis Network ( SCAN ) recording station . For meteorological and climatological precipitation research , quantitatively defining the bias associated with available precipitation data source is critical in selecting which source to use for a given application . Results of this research indicate that the multi-sensor data are in best agreement with surface observation during the cool season ( October-March ) when stratiform precipitation dominates , whereas only moderate correlation exist during the warm season . Additionally , overall bias value among the data source decrease after 2002 , at which point the remotely sensed and surface-based estimate show improved agreement .

aVAs part of their commitment under the Rio Convention , ( 1 ) nation are required to report annual calculated emission of greenhouse gas . The fluorine containing member of this group , which are generally potent greenhouse gas with high Global Warming Potentials , are mainly used in refrigeration and air conditioning . They are emitted only slowly from such system ; hence long term containment is an important engineering and environmental issue . European legislation is designed to effect improvement in containment and a simple way to monitor this would be desirable . The report submitted by European country have been examined to determine the extent to which containment ( expressed a the rate of emission from the bank remaining in equipment ) ha changed with time . Although there is a wide variation between country , the annual emission rate of most of the gas used in refrigeration have improved significantly over the past 10 year and now represent between 5 and 10 % of the bank still contained in equipment . This implies that it would take between 10 and 20 year for the original mass of refrigerant charged into a system to be released into the atmosphere . ( C ) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVThe South American fur seal , Arctocephalus australis , wa one of the earliest otariid seal to be exploited by human : at least 6000 year ago on the Atlantic coast and 4000 on the Pacific coast of South America . More than 750,000 fur seal were killed in Uruguay until 1991 . However , a climatological phenomenon-the severe 1997-1998 El Nino Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) -was responsible for the decline of 72 % Of the Peruvian fur seal population due to starvation a a consequence of warming of sea-surface temperature and primary productivity reduction . Currently , there is no precise information on global population size or on the specie ' conservation status . The present study includes the first bottleneck test for the Pacific and Atlantic population of A. australis based on the analysis of seven microsatellite locus . Genetic bottleneck compromise the evolutionary potential of a population to respond to environmental change . The perspective becomes even more alarming due to current global warming model that predict stronger and more frequent ENSO event in the future . Our analysis found moderate support for deviation from neutrality-equilibrium for the Pacific population of fur seal and none for the Atlantic population . This difference among population reflects different demographic history , and is consistent with a greater reduction in population size in the Pacific . Such an event could be a result of the synergic effect of recurrent ENSO event and the anthropogenic impact ( sealing and prey overfishing ) on this population .

aVEquatorial rain forest that maintain a balance between speciation and extinction are hot-spots for study of biodiversity . Western Ghats in southern India have gained attention due to high tropical biodiversity and endemism in their southern most area . We attempted to track the affinity of the pollen flora of the endemic plant of Western Ghat area within the fossil palynoflora of late Palaeocene-early Eocene ( similar to 55-50 Ma ) sedimentary deposit of western and northeastern Indian region . The study show striking similarity of extant pollen with twenty eight most common fossil pollen taxon of the early Palaeogene . Widespread occurrence of coal and lignite deposit during early Palaeogene provide evidence of existence of well diversified rain forest community and swampy vegetation in the coastal low lying area all along the western and northeastern margin of the Indian subcontinent . Prevalence of excessive humid climate during this period ha been seen a a result of equatorial positioning of Indian subcontinent , superimposed by a long term global warming phase ( PETM and EECO ) during the early Palaeogene . The study present clear evidence that highly diversified equatorial rain forest vegetation once widespread in the Indian subcontinent during early Palaeogene time , are now restricted in a small area a a refugia in the southernmost part of the Western Ghat area . High precipitation and shorter period of dry month seem to have provided suitable environment to sustain lineage of ancient tropical vegetation in this area of Western Ghats in spite of dramatic climatic change subsequent to the post India-Asia collision and during the Quaternary and Recent time .

aVThe potential for evolutionary change in flowering time ha gained considerable attention in view of the current global climate change . To explore this potential and it underlying mechanism in the iteroparous perennial Beta vulgaris ssp . maritima ( sea beet ) , artificial selection for earlier and later flowering date wa applied under semi-natural greenhouse condition . Mean flowering date occurred more than 30 d earlier in 13 generation in the early selection line , but response wa weaker in the late selection line . Taking advantage of the growing knowledge on the genetics and the physiology of flowering induction , particularly in Arabidopsis thaliana , the result obtained here were analysed in term of the four different pathway of flowering induction known in this specie . A first significant correlated response wa stem elongation ( bolting ) in the vegetative stage , suggesting that plant were thus able to flower earlier a long a other requirement were satisfied . Vernalization had a clear influence on flowering date and it influence increased during the selection process , together with sensitivity to photoperiod . Vernalization and photoperiod could compensate for each other : each additional week of vernalization at 5 degree C decreased the necessary daylength for flowering by about 15 min during the later selection stage , while in unselected plant , it wa about 7 min . Devernalizing effect were observed at short day combined with higher temperature . Special attention wa given to the role of the B ( bolting ) gene that cancel the vernalization requirement . The result here obtained suggest that all four known pathway may simultaneously participate in evolutionary change .

aVUncertainty about predicted effect of global warming on freshwater ecosystem led u to manipulate the thermal regime of a shallow groundwater ecosystem . The study area wa separated into a control and treatment block using a sheet-metal groundwater divide to a depth of 1 m. Temperatures were increased according to General Circulation Model ( GCM ) projection for Southern Ontario , Canada . We examined the response of the groundwater chironomid community during pre-manipulation , manipulation and recovery period . We found that warming decreased the total abundance of chironomids whereas no significant change in taxonomic richness wa apparent . Interestingly , taxon composition changed markedly during both the manipulation and the recovery period . Whereas Heterotrissocladius disappeared during the manipulation in the treatment block , other coldstenothermal taxon such a Micropsectra , Parametriocnemus and Heleniella remained unaffected . Conversely , Corynoneura , Polypedilum and Thienemannia gracilis disappeared but were not reported a coldstenothermal . The chironomid community composition in the system changed from a Heterotrissocladius , Brillia , and Tanytarsini-dominated community during the pre-manipulation towards one dominated by Parametriocnemus , Polypedilum , Orthocladius/Cricotopus and Corynoneura during the recovery . Although increased temperature had a strong effect , chironomid occurrence wa also influenced by a number of other abiotic variable , such a dissolved oxygen , depth , ammonia concentration and TDS ( Total dissolved solid ) .

aVHow biodiversity is generated and maintained underlies many major question in evolutionary biology , particularly relating to the tempo and pattern of diversification through time . Molecular phylogeny and new analytical method provide additional tool to help interpret evolutionary process . Evolutionary rate in lineage sometimes appear punctuated , and such `` explosive '' radiation are commonly interpreted a adaptive , leading to causative key innovation being sought . Here we argue that an alternative process might explain apparently rapid radiation ( `` broom-and-handle '' or `` stemmy '' pattern seen in many phylogeny ) with no need to invoke dramatic increase in the rate of diversification . We use simulation to show that mass extinction event can produce the same phylogenetic pattern a that currently being interpreted a due to an adaptive radiation . By comparing simulated and empirical phylogeny of Australian and southern African legume , we find evidence for coincident mass extinction in multiple lineage that could have resulted from global climate change at the end of the Eocene .

aVNuclear energy is reconsidered against global warming but the concern ( nuclear proliferation , radioactive waste , safety etc . ) make it difficult to apply widely in the world . To comprehensively solve these difficulty , we have proposed Th- ( 233 ) U fuel cycle named THORIMS-NES ( Thorium molten-salt nuclear energy synergetics ) . We calculated the mass balance of fissile material and the production of minor actinide ( MA ) governing major part of radioactive waste for evaluating the smooth shift to Th- ( 233 ) U fuel cycle . Th- ( 233 ) U fuel cycle can generate 3 TWe at around 2050 and 10 TWe at around the end of this century by applying Pu obtained from spent nuclear fuel of conventional nuclear system and ( 233 ) U produced by Accelerator Molten-Salt Breeders ( AMSB ) .

aVBACKGROUND : Gene flow between crop and weedy relative depends on the survivorship and reproduction of early-generation hybrid in a field environment . The primary aim of this study wa to compare the fitness of transgenic crop x wild hybrid with their parental type and a non-transgenic crop type in the field under enhanced temperature and humidity . RESULTS : Transgenic insect-resistant oilseed rape ( Brassica napu L. ) , wild brown mustard [ B. juncea ( L. ) Czern et Coss . ] , their hybrid and non-transgenic B. napu were grown in such a way a to mimic field condition after harvest under which volunteer plant might appear in agricultural setting . Factor analysis revealed that vegetative growth characteristic explained most of the observed difference among plant type . Wild brown mustard had the highest fitness during it entire life history . Hybrids had intermediate composite fitness and lowest reproductive fitness . The hybrid and the wild weed shared similar vegetative growth characteristic and seed dormancy in their respective progeny . CONCLUSION : These data indicate that there might be enhanced persistence of the transgene in warmer climate . The absence of fitness cost of the transgene might allow transgene to persist in ecosystem . These data will contribute to risk assessment of transgene persistence and weed management against the backdrop of global climate change . ( C ) 2009 Society of Chemical Industry

aVThe Himalaya ha some of the largest glacier concentration outside the polar region . Despite this , long-term measurement detecting the impact of global warming and changing precipitation pattern on glacier are rare . The Nanga Parbat massif in northern Pakistan is an exception . The cartographer and glaciologist R. Finsterwalder investigated glacier dynamic of this mountain massif in the 1930s , and several other study document change since then . The aim of this study is to detect and analyse the change of Raikot Glacier over the past seven decade . We use a multitemporal and multiscale approach , based on repeat terrestrial image , additional historical data and remotely sensed imagery ( Corona , ASTER , Landsat , Quick Bird ) . The multitemporal approach cover the period 1934-2007 . While the analysis show a total glacier retreat of similar to 200m in 73 year , this general trend wa interrupted by a significant glacier advance between the 1950s and 1980s . Although down-wasting process can be inferred from an increase in debris-covered area , a general trend of reduced glacier thickness doe not appear significant over the whole observation period .

This paper offer result of fluorescence spectroscopy applied to the study of humic and/or humic-like fraction gained from polygenetic syncryogenic sediment in northern Yakutia in comparison with humic substance ( HS ) from recent soil and the Nordic ( NOM ) reference of aquatic natural organic matter . To isolate HS fraction from sediment and soil sample the method of sequential extraction with sulfonate resin ( HS-S fraction ) , carboxylate resin ( HS-C fraction ) and 0.1 M NaCH ( HS-A fraction ) wa used . The HS extract were filtered through a 0.45 mu m membrane filter , following which part of each HS fraction wa broken down into humic acid ( HA ) and fulvic acid ( EA ) . Synchronous fluorescence spectrum were obtained on aqueous solution of all specific HS fraction a well a HA and FA fraction isolated thereof and NOM . Variations in the main peak position and intensity seen on the synchronous fluorescence spectrum of HS-S , HS-C and HS-A extracted from the same soil/sediment sample are apparently indicative of the distinct degree of hurnification of the isolated fraction . It wa found that HA fraction , compared to FA fraction , show a more varied array of fluorescence observation which change depending on the source of HS . Consistent with fluorescence-produced characteristic for HS and HA fraction , sediment sample can be classified into two group , one comprising Pleistocene sediment of the ice complex , the other sediment of the Holocene thickness and Pleistocene buried soil . The HS and HA of the first group manifest dominating peak in the low- and i ntermed iate-wave length spectral region , which is indicative of a relatively low degree of hurnification and certain similarity to NOM . The HS and HA fraction of the second group show a fluorescence signal set typical of recent soil , where the dominating peak of a particular fraction occurs in the long-wavelength region peculiar to a high degree of hurnification .

aVWhile food web have provided a rich vein of research material over the last 50 year , they have largely been the subject matter of the pure ecologist working in natural habitat . While there are some notable exception to this trend , there are , a I explain in this paper , many applied question that could be answered using a food web approach . The paper is divided into two half . The first half provides a brief review of six area where food web have begun to be used a an applied tool : restoration ecology , alien specie , biological control , conservation ecology , habitat management and global warming . The second half outline five area in which a food web approach could prove very rewarding : urban ecology , agroecology , habitat fragmentation , cross-habitat food web and ecosystem service .

aVThis study investigates the effect of global warming on drought pattern over Asia at the end of the twenty-first century by a multi-model ensemble method based on daily precipitation data of 15 coupled climate model simulation under SRES A1B scenario , thereby assessing the consistency of response among different model . The projected precipitation climatology wa translated into the change in drought climatology using the effective drought index . The result of the model were consistent in that they project an increase in the mean and the standard deviation of precipitation over most of Asia , and the increase wa considerably greater in higher latitude area . Therefore , it is expected that in future , drought over most of Asia will occur le frequently with weaker intensity and shorter duration than those prevalent currently . However , two special region were detected . One wa the Asian monsoon region ( AMRs : South Asia and East Asia ) , which showed a greater increase in the standard deviation of precipitation than the mean precipitation , with an amplified seasonal precipitation cycle . As a result , part of the AMRs exhibited slight increase in drought property such a frequency and intensity . The other region wa West Asia . The region showed decreased mean precipitation , especially in it northern part ( Syria and it vicinity ) , and more frequent drought were projected for this region with enhanced drought intensity and lengthened drought duration . The worsening trend in drought pattern over both region were more significant in extreme drought , the likelihood of which is relatively higher in summer in West Asia and from spring to summer in the AMRs .

aVGeneral circulation model computation using a fully coupled ocean-atmosphere model indicate that increasing cloud reflectivity by seeding maritime boundary layer cloud with particle made from seawater may compensate for some of the effect on climate of increasing greenhouse gas concentration . The chosen seeding strategy ( one of many possible scenario ) can restore global average of temperature , precipitation and sea ice to present day value , but not simultaneously . The response varies nonlinearly with the extent of seeding , and geoengineering generates local change to important climatic feature . The global tradeoff of restoring ice cover , and cooling the planet , must be assessed alongside the local change to climate feature .

aVOf the many mechanism by which global climate change may alter ecosystem process perhaps the least known and insidious is altered disturbance regime . We used a field-based experiment to examine the climate change scenario of more frequent fire with altered invertebrate assemblage on the decomposition of Eucalyptus leaf . Our design comprised three fire regime [ long-term fire exclusion ( FE ) , long-term frequent burning ( FB ) and FE altered to FB ( FEFB ) ] and two litter bag mesh size ( 8.0 and 0.2 mm ) that either permitted or denied access to the leaf litter by most invertebrate . We found a significant interaction effect between fire regime and mesh size in loss of litter mass and net carbon ( C ) . Compared with the regime of FE , with more frequent burning ( FB and FEFB ) the pace of decomposition wa slowed by 41 % ( when access to litter by most invertebrate is not impeded ) . For the regime of FE , denying access to leaf litter by most invertebrate did not alter the pace of decomposition . Conversely , under regime of frequently burning , restricting access to the litter by most invertebrate altered the pace of decomposition by 46 % . Similar result were found for net C. For net loss of nitrogen ( N ) , no interaction effect between fire regime and mesh size were detected , although both main effect were significant . Our result show that by modifying disturbance regime such a fire frequency , global climate change ha the potential to modify the mechanism by which ecosystem function . With more FB , decomposition is driven not only by fire regime induced change in substrate quality and/or physiochemical condition but through the interaction of disturbance regime with animal assemblage mediating ecosystem process .

aVVibrio alginolyticus is a halophilic Gram-negative bacterium normally present in seawater . Vibrios are not capable of cutaneous invasion through intact skin and their isolation from extraintestinal site is uncommon . However , interruption in skin integrity ( cut or abrasion ) can allow these bacteria to cause complicated skin and soft tissue infection . This case study describes the clinical assessment and management of a nonhealing traumatic wound , sustained in a coastal area during the winter month , in a healthy 70-year-old man . Culture result were positive for V alginolyticus . Appropriate antibiotic treatment and topical wound care successfully resolved the infection . V alginolyticus infection are usually benign ; respond well to treatment , even with local therapy only ; and tend to result from contact with warm ocean water . The clinical characteristic of the wound prompted a suspicion of a Vibrio infection even though the wound wa sustained in the winter time and the patient did not have direct contact with ocean water . Although other case study of Vibrio infection in the absence of direct contact with ocean water have been published , increased ocean temperature due to global climate change may explain the out-of-season infection in this patient . Clinicians should monitor the progression of wound healing and be prepared to modify treatment based on individual circumstance , especially in the case of unusual wound presentation , nonhealing , or a progressing wound infection .

aVThis study employ logical , scientific understanding and prediction of a Sensitivity Model which is an integer tool in the assessment of climate change for China . It simulated a smooth environmental sustainable transition for the next ten year , given the 11 simulated variable . The positive coefficient for GDP growth variable suggests that estimated emission initially rise with GDP growth , and eventually fall ; the impact of population on emission ha been more pronounced in lower rather than in higher income range , contradicting Environmental Kuznet Curve . The role of energy efficiency on emission ha been the greatest when CO ( 2 ) emission is at it peak .

aVThe increase in the global air temperature is an inadequate measure of global warming , which should rather be considered in term of energy . The ongoing global warming mean that heat ha been accumulating since 1880 in the air , ground and water . Before explaining this warming by external heat source , the net heat emission on Earth must be considered . Such emission from , e. g. , the global use of fossil fuel and nuclear power , must contribute to global warming . The aim of this study is to compare globally accumulated and emitted heat . The heat accumulated in the air corresponds to 6.6 % of global warming , while the remaining heat is stored in the ground ( 31.5 % ) , melting of ice ( 33.4 % ) and sea water ( 28.5 % ) . It wa found that the net heat emission from 1880-2000 correspond to 74 % of the accumulated heat , i.e. , global warming , during the same period . The missing heat ( 26 % ) must have other cause , e. g. , the greenhouse effect , the natural variation in the climate and/or the underestimation of net heat emission . Most measure that have already been taken to combat global warming are also beneficial for the current explanation , though nuclear power is not a solution to ( but part of ) the problem .

aVClimate change is expected to alter the geographic distribution of wildfire , a complex abiotic process that responds to a variety of spatial and environmental gradient . How future climate change may alter global wildfire activity , however , is still largely unknown . As a first step to quantifying potential change in global wildfire , we present a multivariate quantification of environmental driver for the observed , current distribution of vegetation fire using statistical model of the relationship between fire activity and resource to burn , climate condition , human influence , and lightning flash rate at a coarse spatiotemporal resolution ( 100 km , over one decade ) . We then demonstrate how these statistical model can be used to project future change in global fire pattern , highlighting regional hotspot of change in fire probability under future climate condition a simulated by a global climate model . Based on current condition , our result illustrate how the availability of resource to burn and climate condition conducive to combustion jointly determine why some part of the world are fire-prone and others are fire-free . In contrast to any expectation that global warming should necessarily result in more fire , we find that regional increase in fire probability may be counter-balanced by decrease at other location , due to the interplay of temperature and precipitation variable . Despite this net balance , our model predict substantial invasion and retreat of fire across large portion of the globe . These change could have important effect on terrestrial ecosystem since alteration in fire activity may occur quite rapidly , generating ever more complex environmental challenge for specie dispersing and adjusting to new climate condition . Our finding highlight the potential for widespread impact of climate change on wildfire , suggesting severely altered fire regime and the need for more explicit inclusion of fire in research on global vegetation-climate change dynamic and conservation planning .

aVThis paper present a simplified approach to ass the effect of global warming on global coastal groundwater resource over the next century based on the smallest but necessary number of element such a rainfall , temperature , hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer , and population change regarding the consumption of groundwater . The positive aspect in this approach is that there is availability of the above element in the majority of the planet . Methodology includes a sharp interface concept model and simplified estimation of groundwater recharge using limited climate data . The evaluation show that the future climate change would decrease fresh groundwater resource in Central American , South American , South African and Australian region whereas most of the area in Asia , except South-East Asia . Combinations of fresh groundwater loss and global population are considered to state the vulnerability of future fresh groundwater supply . Vulnerability assessment show that South Asia , Central America , North Africa and the Sahara , South Africa and the Middle East country are highly vulnerable whereas , Northern Europe , Western part of South America , New Zealand and Japan are le vulnerable with respect to future fresh groundwater supply . Further , this paper highlight the necessity Integrated Coastal Management ( ICM ) practice in these vulnerable coastal region to ensure the sustainable development in coastal region .

aVDengue/dengue hemorrhagic fever is the most important vector-borne viral disease globally , with over half of the world 's population living in area at risk of infection . Frequent and cyclical epidemic are reported throughout the tropical world , with regular importation of the virus via viremic traveler into both endemic and nonendemic country . These event coincide with the recently observed global warming that is associated with climate change . Whether these event are coincidental is examined in this article . The history of dengue emergence is traced to determine the major driver responsible for the spread of both the virus and mosquito vector to new geographic region . We conclude that demographic- and anthropogenic-driven environmental change , combined with globalization and inefficient public health measure rather than climate change , are the principal driving force for the re-emergence and spread of epidemic dengue in the past 40 year . These trend are likely to continue given the global trend projected by the United Nations .

aVGlobal climate model used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) Fourth Assessment Report ( AR4 ) are examined for the top-of-atmosphere radiation change a carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas build up from 1950 to 2100 . There is an increase in net radiation absorbed , but not in way commonly assumed . While there is a large increase in the greenhouse effect from increasing greenhouse gas and water vapor ( a a feedback ) , this is offset to a large degree by a decreasing greenhouse effect from reducing cloud cover and increasing radiative emission from higher temperature . Instead the main warming from an energy budget standpoint come from increase in absorbed solar radiation that stem directly from the decreasing cloud amount . These finding underscore the need to ascertain the credibility of the model change , especially insofar a change in cloud are concerned. & nbsp ;

aVWith a president committed to fighting climate change and a new Congress inclined to go along , the prospect for greenhouse gas emission abatement legislation are bright . That 's good news . The Bush and Clinton administration ' intransigence on this issue set back U.S. action by at least a decade . But it should not obscure the reality that one obstacle to a successful effort in slowing global warming -- the cooperation of the rapidly developing economy -- is truly daunting . Indeed , failure to acknowledge the difficulty of herding this particular pride of cat in the right direction could cost u another lost decade . Although there is hardly a consensus about the content of the coming legislation , a market-based system that distributes carbon emission right among stakeholder and encourages them to minimize cost by freely trading the permit will probably be at the core of it . The biggest unknown is whether the legislation will tie U.S. containment effort to those of other country and whether it will include measure to encourage their cooperation .

aVAgricultural tillage practice play an important role in the production and/or consumption of green house gas ( GHG ) that contributes substantially to the observed global warming . Central China is one of the world 's major rice producing area but a few study have tried to characterize the mechanism of GHG release from rice paddy field and quantify global warming ( GWPs ) based on GHGs emission on this region . In this study four tillage system consisting of no-tillage with no fertilizer ( NT0 ) , conventional tillage with no fertilizer ( CT0 ) , no-tillage with compound fertilizer ( NTC ) and conventional tillage with compound fertilizer ( CTC ) application in rice ( Oryza sativa L. ) cultivation were compared in term of the carbon dioxide ( CO ( 2 ) ) , methane ( CH ( 4 ) ) and nitrous oxide ( N ( 2 ) O ) emission from different tillage system of the subtropical region of China during the rice growing season in 2008 . GWPS based on CO ( 2 ) , CH4 and N ( 2 ) O 'S cumulative emission were also compared . Tillage and fertilization had no influence on CO ( 2 ) emission . No-tillage had no effect on N ( 2 ) O emission but significantly affected CH ( 4 ) emission . Application of fertilizer significantly affected CH ( 4 ) and N ( 2 ) O emission . Higher CH ( 4 ) emission and lower N ( 2 ) O emission were observed in CTC than in NTC . Cumulative CH ( 4 ) emission flux in NTC wa 51.68 g CH ( 4 ) m ( -2 ) while it wa 65.96 g CH ( 4 ) m ( -2 ) in CTC , 28 % ( p < 0.05 ) higher than that in NTC . Cumulative N ( 2 ) O emission flux in CTC wa 561.00 mg N ( 2 ) O m ( -2 ) , and wa 741.71 mg N ( 2 ) O m ( -2 ) in NTC , 33 % ( p < 0.05 ) higher than that in CTC . There wa no significant difference in N ( 2 ) O emission between NT0 and CT0 system , but significant in CH ( 4 ) emission . GWP of CTC wa 26011.58 kg CO ( 2 ) ha ( -1 ) , which wa 12 % higher than that in NTC ( 23361.3 kg CO ( 2 ) ha ( -1 ) ) , therefore our finding show that no-tillage system wa an effective strategy to reduce GWP from rice paddy in central China and thus can serve a a good agricultural system for environmental conservation .

aVConventional theory of global warming state that heating of atmosphere occurs a a result of accumulation of CO ( 2 ) and CH ( 4 ) in atmosphere . The writer show that rising concentration of CO ( 2 ) should result in the cooling of climate . The methane accumulation ha no essential effect on the Earth 's climate . Even significant release of the anthropogenic carbon dioxide into the atmosphere do not change average parameter of the Earth 's heat regime and the atmospheric greenhouse effect . Moreover , CO ( 2 ) concentration increase in the atmosphere result in rising agricultural productivity and improves the condition for reforestation . Thus , accumulation of small additional amount of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere a a result of anthropogenic activity ha practically no effect on the Earth 's climate .

aVThe municipal solid waste management significantly contributes to the emission in the atmosphere of greenhouse gas ( e.g . CO ( 2 ) , CH ( 4 ) , N ( 2 ) O ) and therefore the management process from collection to treatment and disposal ha to be optimized in order to reduce these emission . In this paper , starting from the average composition of undifferentiated municipal solid waste in Italy , the effect of separate collection on greenhouse gas emission from municipal waste management ha been assessed . Different combination of separate collection scenario and disposal option ( i.e . landfilling and incineration ) have been considered . The effect of energy recovery from waste both in landfill and incinerator ha also been addressed . The result outline how a separate collection approach can have a significant effect on the emission of greenhouse gas and how wise municipal solid waste management , implying the adoption of Best Available Technologies ( i.e . biogas recovery and exploitation system in landfill and energy recovery system in Waste to Energy plant ) , can not only significantly reduce greenhouse gas emission but , in certain case , can also make the overall process a carbon sink . Moreover it ha been shown that separate collection of plastic is a major issue when dealing with global warming relevant emission from municipal solid waste management . ( C ) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

aVManagement of post-consumer solid waste contributes to emission of greenhouse gas ( GHGs ) representing about 3 % of global anthropogenic GHG emission . Most GHG reporting initiative around the world utilize two metric proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) : radiative forcing ( RF ) and global warming potential ( GWP ) . This paper provides a general introduction of the factor that define a GHG and explains the scientific background for estimating RF and GWP , thereby exposing the lay reader to a brief overview of the method for calculating the effect of GHGs on climate change . An objective of this paper is to increase awareness that the GWP of GHGs ha been re-adjusted a the concentration and relative proportion of these GHGs ha changed with time ( e.g. , the GWP of methane ha changed from 21 to 25 CO ( 2 ) -eq ) . Improved understanding of the indirect effect of GHGs ha also led to a modification in the methodology for calculating GWP . Following a presentation of theory behind GHG , RF and GWP concept , the paper briefly describes the most important GHG source and sink in the context of the waste management industry . The paper serf a a primer for more detailed research publication presented in this special issue of Waste Management & Research providing a technology-based assessment of quantitative GHG emission from different waste management technology .

aVIn mountain environment , spatial and temporal pattern of snow accumulation and melt are dominant control on hydrologic response to climate change . In this paper , we develop a simple conceptual model that link the timing of peak snowmelt with geologically mediated difference in rate of streamflow recession . This model demonstrates that within the western United States , spatial difference in subsurface drainage rate can exacerbate summer streamflow loss associated with diminishing snowpacks . Application of a process-based hydrologic model to four watershed in the Western Cordillera further reveals that contingent on timing of snowmelt , slower draining watershed are likely to have more water in summer but paradoxically are subject to the greatest summer water loss under a 1.5 degree C warming scenario . A slow draining watershed located in the young volcanic arc of the High Cascades in Oregon show 4 time the summer streamflow reduction when compared with faster draining watershed with similar timing of peak snowmelt . On the other hand , watershed where snowmelt occurs late in the season but have little groundwater influence show high relative sensitivity to snowpack change due to warming , a shown by a high-elevation granitic Sierran watershed . Our result highlight the importance of geological factor in interpreting hydrologic response to climate change and argue for a geoclimatic framework to guide the design of monitoring network that will become the basis for assessing climate change impact in mountain region throughout the globe .

aVThe temperature dependence of C ( 3 ) photosynthesis may be altered by the growth environment . The effect of long-term growth in elevated CO ( 2 ) on photosynthesis temperature response have been investigated in wheat ( Triticum aestivum L. ) grown in controlled chamber with 370 or 700 mu mol mol ( -1 ) CO ( 2 ) from sowing through to anthesis . Gas exchange wa measured in flag leaf at ear emergence , and the parameter of a biochemical photosynthesis model were determined along with their temperature response . Elevated CO ( 2 ) slightly decreased the CO ( 2 ) compensation point and increased the rate of respiration in the light and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase ( Rubisco ) V ( cmax ) , although the latter effect wa reversed at 15 degree C. With elevated CO ( 2 ) , J ( max ) decreased in the 15-25 degree C temperature range and increased at 30 and 35 degree C. The temperature response ( activation energy ) of V ( cmax ) and J ( max ) increased with growth in elevated CO ( 2 ) . CO ( 2 ) enrichment decreased the ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate ( RuBP ) -limited photosynthesis rate at lower temperature and increased Rubisco- and RuBP-limited rate at higher temperature . The result show that the photosynthesis temperature response is enhanced by growth in elevated CO ( 2 ) . We conclude that if temperature acclimation and factor such a nutrient or water availability do not modify or negate this enhancement , the effect of future increase in air CO ( 2 ) on photosynthetic electron transport and Rubisco kinetics may improve the photosynthetic response of wheat to global warming .

aVObservations show that the Hadley cell ha widened by about 2 degrees-5 degree since 1979 . This widening and the concomitant poleward displacement of the subtropical dry zone may be accompanied by large-scale drying near 30 degree N and 30 degree S. Such drying pose a risk to inhabitant of these region who are accustomed to established rainfall pattern . Simple and comprehensive general circulation model ( GCMs ) indicate that the Hadley cell may widen in response to global warming , warming of the west Pacific , or polar stratospheric cooling . The combination of these factor may be responsible for the recent observation . But there is no study so far that ha compared the observed widening to GCM simulation of twentieth-century climate integrated with historical change in forcings . Here the Hadley cell widening is assessed in current GCMs from historical simulation of the twentieth century a well a future climate projection and preindustrial control run . The author find that observed widening can not be explained by natural variability . This observed widening is also significantly larger than in simulation of the twentieth and twenty-first century . These result illustrate the need for further investigation into the discrepancy between the observed and simulated widening of the Hadley cell .

aVSmall mammal appear to be le vulnerable to extinction than large specie , but the underlying reason are poorly understood . Here , we provide evidence that almost all ( 93.5 % ) of 61 recently extinct mammal specie were homeothermic , maintaining a constant high body temperature and thus energy expenditure , which demand a high intake of food , long foraging time , and thus exposure to predator . In contrast , only 6.5 % of extinct mammal were likely heterothermic and employed multi-day torpor ( hibernation ) or daily torpor , even though torpor is widespread within more than half of all mammalian order . Torpor is characterized by substantial reduction of body temperature and energy expenditure and enhances survival during adverse condition by minimizing food and water requirement , and consequently reduces foraging requirement and exposure to predator . Moreover , because life span is generally longer in heterothermic mammal than in related homeotherm , heterotherms can employ a 'sit-and-wait ' strategy to withstand adverse period and then repopulate when circumstance improve . Thus , torpor is a crucial but hitherto unappreciated attribute of small mammal for avoiding extinction . Many opportunistic heterothermic specie , because of their plastic energetic requirement , may also stand a better chance of future survival than homeothermic specie in the face of greater climatic extreme and change in environmental condition caused by global warming .

aVRationale Episode analysis of heat wave have documented a comparatively higher impact on mortality than on morbidity ( hospital admission ) in European city . The evidence from daily time series study is scarce and inconsistent . Objectives : To evaluate the impact of high environmental temperature on hospital admission during April to September in 12 European city participating in the Assessment and Prevention of Acute Health Effects of Weather Conditions in Europe ( PHEWE ) project . Methods : For each city , time series analysis wa used to model the relationship between maximum apparent temperature ( lag 0-3 day ) and daily hospital admission for cardiovascular , cerebrovascular , and respiratory cause by age ( all age , 65-74 age group , and 75+ age group ) , and the city-specific estimate were pooled for two geographical grouping of city . Measurements and Main Results : For respiratory admission , there wa a positive association that wa heterogeneous between city . For a 1 degree C increase in maximum apparent temperature above a threshold , respiratory admission increased by +4.5 % ( 95 % confidence interval , 1.9-7.3 ) and +3.1 % ( 95 % confidence interval , 0.8-5.5 ) in the 75+ age group in Mediterranean and North-Continental city , respectively . In contrast , the association between temperature and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular admission tended to be negative and did not reach statistical significance . Conclusions : High temperature have a specific impact on respiratory admission , particularly in the elderly population , but the underlying mechanism are poorly understood . Why high temperature increase cardiovascular mortality but not cardiovascular admission is also unclear . The impact of extreme heat event on respiratory admission is expected to increase in European city a a result of global warming and progressive population aging .

aVAccelerated erosion and transport of fine sediment from upland temperate catchment can reflect increased erosivity and/or erodibility , due in turn to climatic and/or human forcing . Identification of sediment flux and source over Holocene timescales can both enable understanding of the relative impact of these forcings and provide perspective on recent sediment flux . Here we present a similar to 5500 yr record of sediment flux and source from Lake Bassenthwaite in the English Lake District , utilizing magnetic measurement and fuzzy clustering , coupled with independent pollen and archaeological record , to identify the timing and impact of catchment disturbance . This record show that recent sediment flux increase ( ie , within the last 150 year ) are unprecedented in scale throughout the mid-late Holocene and appear to be in response to specific human change occurring within the catchment . Earlier episode of human activity , from the mid Holocene onwards , show no link with increased lake sediment flux , indicating either limited catchment impact and/or 'buffering ' through within-catchment sediment storage . Increasingly intensive land use and reduction of sediment storage through revetment construction on a key inflow , Newlands Beck , have resulted in a x increase in lake sediment flux . These data may be significant for other upland temperate area , a increasing land-use pressure and reduced sediment storage capacity may not only increase contemporary sediment flux , but increase sensitivity to predicted increase in rainfall and storminess a a result of global climate change .

aVOn entering an era of global warming , the stability of the Greenland ice sheet ( GIS ) is an important concern ( 1 ) , especially in the light of new evidence of rapidly changing flow and melt condition at the GIS margin ( 2 ) . Studying the response of the GIS to past climatic change may help to advance our understanding of GIS dynamic . The previous interpretation of evidence from stable isotope ( delta ( 18 ) O ) in water from GIS ice core wa that Holocene climate variability on the GIS differed spatially ( 3 ) and that a consistent Holocene climate optimum-the unusually warm period from about 9,000 to 6,000 year ago found in many northern-latitude palaeoclimate record ( 4 ) -did not exist . Here we extract both the Greenland Holocene temperature history and the evolution of GIS surface elevation at four GIS location . We achieve this by comparing delta ( 18 ) O from GIS ice core ( 3,5 ) with delta ( 18 ) O from ice core from small marginal icecap . Contrary to the earlier interpretation of delta ( 18 ) O evidence from ice core ( 3,6 ) , our new temperature history reveals a pronounced Holocene climatic optimum in Greenland coinciding with maximum thinning near the GIS margin . Our delta ( 18 ) O-based result are corroborated by the air content of ice core , a proxy for surface elevation ( 7 ) . State-of-the-art ice sheet model are generally found to be underestimating the extent and change in GIS elevation and area ; our finding may help to improve the ability of model to reproduce the GIS response to Holocene climate .

aVObservations indicate that greenhouse induced twentieth-century warming ha been strongly modulated by variation in surface solar radiation . Between the 1950s and 1980s , declining surface solar radiation ( `` global dimming '' ) likely caused a dampening of global warming , whereas increasing surface solar radiation ( `` brightening '' ) may have contributed to the rapid warming in the last 2 decade , and possibly also in the first half of the twentieth century . This is also reflected in the decadal evolution of diurnal temperature range , which is highly correlated with surface solar radiation , and which show a distinct transition from a strong decrease between the 1950s and 1980s , toward a leveling off thereafter . The present study investigates to what extent these effect are simulated in the latest generation of global climate model used in the fourth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) assessment report ( AR4 ) ( phase 3 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project ( CMIP3 ) model ) . While these model reproduce the overall twentieth century warming over global land surface well , they underestimate the decadal variation in the warming and particularly also in diurnal temperature range , indicative of a lack of decadal variation in surface solar radiation in the model .

aVDecomposition of organic matter in inundated wetland soil requires a number of interdependent microbial process that ultimately generate CO ( 2 ) and CH ( 4 ) . Largely a the result of anaerobic decomposition , wetland soil store globally significant amount of organic carbon and are currently net source of CH ( 4 ) to the atmosphere . Given the importance of wetland in the global carbon cycle , it is important to understand control on anaerobic decomposition in order to predict feedback between wetland soil and global climate change . One perplexing pattern observed in many wetland soil is the high proportion Of CO ( 2 ) resulting from anaerobic decomposition that can not be explained by any measured pathway of microbial respiration . Recent study have hypothesized that humic substance , and in particular solid-phase humic substance in wetland soil , can support anaerobic microbial respiration by acting a organic electron acceptor . Humic substance may thus account for much of the currently unexplained CO ( 2 ) measured during decomposition in wetland soil . Here we demonstrate that humic acid extracted from a variety of wetland soil act a either electron donor or electron acceptor and alter the ratio of CO ( 2 ) : CH ( 4 ) produced during anaerobic laboratory incubation . Our result suggest that soil-derived humic substance may play an important , and currently unexplored , role in anaerobic decomposition in wetland soil . ( C ) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVThis study explores global energy demand , and hydrogen 's role , over the 21st century . it considers four illustrative case : a high ( 1000 EJ ) and a low ( 300 EJ ) energy future , and for each of these condition , a high ( 80 % ) and low ( 20 % ) fossil fuel energy share . We argue that neither high energy future is probable , because of resource limitation , and rising energy , environmental and money cost per unit of delivered energy a annual energy demand rise far beyond present level . The low energy/low fossil case is most likely , followed by the low energy/high fossil case , although both require large cut in energy use , and most probably , lifestyle change in high energy use country . Hydrogen production would be best favoured in the low fossil fuel option , with production both greater , and implemented earlier , in the higher energy case , it is thus least likely in the low energy/high fossil fuel case .

aVRecent development in climate modeling suggest that global warming is likely to favor condition for the development of drought in many region of Europe . Studies evaluating possible change in drought hazard typically have employed index that are derived solely from climate variable such a temperature and precipitation , whereas many of the impact of drought are more related to hydrological variable such a river flow . This study examines the impact of global warming on streamflow drought in Europe by comparing low-flow prediction of a hydrological model driven by high-resolution regional climate simulation for the end of the previous century and for the end of this century based on the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios A2 greenhouse gas emission scenario . For both time slice , low-flow characteristic were derived from the simulated streamflow series using extreme value analysis . More specifically , we employed the method of block maximum and partial duration series to obtain minimum flow and flow deficit and fitted extreme value distribution by the maximum likelihood method . In order not to mix drought event with different physical cause the analysis wa performed separately for the frost and nonfrost season . Results show that in the frost-free season streamflow drought will become more severe and persistent in most part of Europe by the end of this century , except in the most northern and northeastern region . In the frost season , streamflow drought condition will be of le importance under future climate condition .

aVClimate change continues to have major impact on crop productivity all over the world . Many researcher have evaluated the possible impact of global warming on crop yield using mainly indirect crop simulation model . Here we use a 1979-2000 Chinese crop-specific panel dataset to investigate the climate impact on Chinese wheat yield growth . We find that a 1 degree C increase in wheat growing season temperature reduces wheat yield by about 3-10 % . This negative impact is le severe than those reported in other region . Rising temperature over the past two decade account for a 4.5 % decline in wheat yield in China while the majority of the wheat yield growth , 64 % , come from increased use of physical input . We emphasize the necessity of including such major influencing factor a physical input into the crop yield-climate function in order to have an accurate estimation of climate impact on crop yield .

aVLake Qinghai , the largest saline lake in China , cover 4234 km ( 2 ) ( 2007 ) with a catchment area of 29 660 km ( 2 ) on the northeastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau . The ecosystem of the lake is extremely vulnerable and sensitive to global climate change and human interference . However , little information is available on land use/cover change ( LUCC ) in Lake Qinghai watershed . Using a geographical information system ( GIS ) and remote sensing ( RS ) , this study analysed land use and land cover change pattern in Lake Qinghai watershed between 1977 and 2004 and discussed major environmental issue in this area . LUCC analysis indicated that grassland ( 63 per cent ) and water body ( 18 per cent ) dominated in the watershed and the magnitude of the land use and land cover change wa generally low ; the percentage of the change of various land type relative to the total area wa le than I per cent . From 1977 to 2004 , cropland , sandy land , bare rock , salinized land , swampland and built-up area increased by 0.43 , 0.35 , 0.24 , 0.06 , 0.03 and 0.03 per cent of the total area , respectively ; in contrast , water body , grassland and woodland decreased by 0.99 , 0.22 and 0.05 per cent , respectively . Moreover , the area of LUCC tended to expand from place around the lake to the upper reach of the watershed during the last three decade . The LUCC transition pattern wa : woodland converted to grassland , grassland converted to cropland and water body converted to sandy land . Lake level decline and grassland degradation are major ecological and environmental problem in Lake Qinghai watershed . The level and area of the lake decreased at the rate of 6.7 cm a ( -1 ) and 6.4 km ( 2 ) a ( -1 ) , respectively , between 1959 and 2007 , resulting in sandy land expansion and water quality deterioration . Lake level decline and area shrinkage wa mainly attributed to climate change , but grassland degradation wa mainly resulted from anthropogenic activity ( increasing population , overgrazing and policy ) .

aVThe impact of some high-pressure diecasting ( HPDC ) process parameter on greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emission are quantified using life cycle analysis ( LCA ) for both aluminum and magnesium alloy . The study wa conducted according to ISO 14040 standard and wa based on an automotive component made on cold-chamber HPDC machine operating in typical mass production environment . The aluminum alloy foundry wa located in Australia ; the magnesium alloy foundry wa located in the United States . In both case , emission were found to reduce with an increasing HPDC process yield . However , yield variation had only a modest impact on GHG emission in the aluminum alloy HPDC , due to the excellent in-plant recycling of the alloy and the relatively low emission from primary aluminum production compared with primary magnesium production . In contrast , for the magnesium alloy , significant reduction in emission were recorded a the yield increased . This outcome wa attributed to the considerable saving achieved in raw material quantity sourced from high-emitting primary production and the use of lower amount of SF ( 6 ) , a GHG with a very high global warming potential ( GWP ) . These result were found to hold irrespective of change to the ratio between the primary and secondary alloy in the raw material mix , although the magnitude of the impact wa reduced considerably with reduction in the primary alloy component . In the case of the magnesium alloy HPDC , decrease in quality assurance ( QA ) reject and cycle time were also found to contribute toward reduced emission , although their influence were an order of magnitude lower than that of the yield improvement .

aVIn the low-resolution version of the Community Climate System Model , version 3 ( CCSM3 ) , the modeled North Pacific decadal variability is demonstrated to be independent of the epoch for which a statistically steady control simulation is constructed , either preindustrial or modern ; however , it is demonstrated to be significantly affected by the different global warming scenario investigated . In the control simulation , the North Pacific basin is shown to be dominated by sea surface temperature ( SST ) variability with a time scale of approximately 20 yr . This mode of variability is in close accord with the observed characteristic of the Pacific decadal oscillation ( PDO ) . A detailed analysis of the statistical equilibrium run is performed based on other model variable a well [ sea surface salinity ( SSS ) , barotropic circulation , freshwater and heat flux , wind stress curl , sea ice , and snow coverage ] . These analysis confirm that the underlying mechanism of the PDO involves a basin-scale mode of ocean adjustment to change of the atmospheric forcing associated with the Aleutian low pressure system . However , they also suggest that the observed sign reversal of the PDO arises from a feedback in the northern part of the basin . In this novel hypothesis , the advection to the Bering Sea of `` spice '' anomaly formed in the central and western Pacific set up a typical 10-yr time scale for the triggering of the PDO reversal . In all of the global warming simulation described in this paper , the signal represented by the detrended SST variability in the North Pacific display significant power at multidecadal frequency . In these simulation , the natural North Pacific decadal variability , a characterized in the control simulation ( the PDO ) , remains the leading mode of variability only for moderate forcing . If the warming is too strong , then the typical 20-yr time scale of the canonical PDO can no longer be detected , except in term of SSS variability and only prior to a significant change that occurs in the Bering Strait Throughflow .

aVThe nature of the multidecadal variability in the North Atlantic basin is investigated through detailed analysis of multicentury integration performed using the low-resolution version of the Community Climate System Model , version 3 ( CCSM3 ) , a modern atmosphere-ocean coupled general circulation model . Specifically , the result of control simulation under both preindustrial and present-day perpetual seasonal cycle condition are compared to each other and also to the result of five simulation with increasing CO ( 2 ) concentration scenario . In the absence of greenhouse gas-induced warming , the meridional overturning circulation ( MOC ) variability is shown to be dependent on the detail of the simulation . In the present-day control simulation , the MOC is characterized by a broad spectrum of low frequency , whereas , in preindustrial control simulation , MOC variability is characterized either by a well-defined periodicity of 60 yr or by a broad spectrum of low frequency . In all the control simulation , the MOC appears to respond with a delay of 10 yr to synchronous temperature and salinity anomaly in the deep water formation site located in the subpolar gyre , but salinity dominates the density anomaly . The explanation of the modeled MOC periodicity is therefore sought in the creation of these density anomaly . The influence of increased sea ice coverage under cold/preindustrial condition is shown to modify the salinity variability , but it is not a sufficient condition for the support of the MOC periodicity . Instead , it source appears to be a modified subpolar gyre circulation resulting from interaction with the bottom bathymetry , which is able to sustain strong coupling between the horizontal and overturning circulation . Based on the global warming analysis , for the simulation initialized from the cold/preindustrial statistical equilibrium run , the North Atlantic variability continues to be dominated by strong coupling between the horizontal and overturning circulation if the imposed forcing is weak . More generally , the delayed response of the MOC to surface density anomaly in the deep water formation region is preserved under weak forcing .

aVEnergy Security and Global Warming are analysed a 21st century sustainability threat . Best estimate of future energy availability are derived a an Energy Reference Case ( ERC ) . An explicit economic growth model is used to interpret the impact of the ERC on economic growth . The model predicts a divergence from 20th century equilibrium condition in economic growth and socioeconomic welfare is only stabilised under optimistic assumption that demand a paradigm shift in contemporary economic thought and focused attention from policy maker . Fossil fuel depletion also constrains the maximum extent of Global Warming . Carbon emission from the ERC comply nominally with the B1 scenario , which is the lowest emission case considered by the IPCC . The IPCC predicts a temperature response within acceptance limit of the Global Warming debate for the B1 scenario . The carbon feedback cycle , used in the IPCC model , is shown a invalid for low-emissions scenario and an alternative carbon cycle reduces the temperature response for the ERC considerably compared to the IPCC prediction . Our analysis proposes that the extent of Global Warming may be acceptable and preferable compared to the socio-economic consequence of not exploiting fossil fuel reserve to their full technical potential .

aVImportant greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emission related to waste incineration and co-combustion of waste were identified and considered relative to critical aspect such a : the content of biogenic and fossil carbon , N ( 2 ) O emission , fuel and material consumption at the plant , energy recovery , and solid residue generated . GHG contribution were categorized with respect to direct emission from the combustion plant a well a indirect upstream contribution ( e.g . provision of fuel and material ) and indirect downstream contribution ( e.g . substitution of electricity and heat produced elsewhere ) . GHG accounting wa done per tonne of waste received at the plant . The content of fossil carbon in the input waste , for example a plastic , wa found to be critical for the overall level of the GHG emission , but also the energy conversion efficiency were essential . The emission factor for electricity provision ( also substituted electricity ) affected the indirect downstream emission with a factor of 3-9 depending on the type of electricity generation assumed . Provision of auxiliary fuel , material and resource corresponded to up to 40 % of the direct emission from the plant ( which were 347-371 kg CO ( 2 ) -eq.tonne ( -1 ) of waste for incineration and 735-803 kg CO ( 2 ) -eq.tonne ( -1 ) of waste for co-combustion ) . Indirect downstream saving were within the range of -480 to -1373 kg CO ( 2 ) -eq.tonne ( -1 ) of waste for incineration and within -181 to -2607 kg CO ( 2 ) -eq.tonne ( -1 ) of waste for co-combustion . N ( 2 ) O emission and residue management did not appear to play significant role .

aVCarbon dioxide ( CO ( 2 ) ) accounting is important to global ecological footprint analysis . However methane ( CH ( 4 ) ) , with a global warming potential ( GWP ) 25 time that of CO ( 2 ) , should not be neglected a an environmental indicator for informed environmental management . While this is a significant component , the CH ( 4 ) associated with imported embodied energy should also be included in national greenhouse gas ( GHG ) inventory . This study proposes an initial method for incorporating methane into ecological footprint analysis and hope to inform future debate on it inclusion . In order to account for difference in methane intensity from exporting country , methane intensity for OECD country were calculated using emission and energy consumption estimate taken directly from National Inventory Reports ( NIR ) , published in conjunction with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) . For other country the methane intensity were estimated using energy balance published by the International Energy Association ( IEA ) and IPCC default emission factor . In order to estimate embodied organic methane , material import and export were translated into unit ( such a live animal ) capable of conversion into methane emission . A significant increase in Ireland 's footprint result from the inclusion of the GWP of methane is included within the footprint calculation . ( C ) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All right reserved .

aVIn 2006 , Fairbanks , AK , reported it first case of fatal anaphylaxis a a result of Hymenoptera sting concurrent with an increase in insect reaction observed throughout the state . This study wa designed to determine whether Alaska medical visit for insect reaction have increased . We conducted a retrospective review of three independent patient database in Alaska to identify trend of patient seeking medical care for adverse reaction after insect-related event . For each database , an insect reaction wa defined a a claim for the International Classification of Diseases , Ninth Edition ( ICD-9 ) , code E9053 , E906.4 , and 989.5 . Increases in insect reaction in each region were compared with temperature change in the same region . Each database revealed a statistically significant trend in patient seeking care for insect reaction . Fairbanks Memorial Hospital Emergency Department reported a fourfold increase in patient in 2006 compared with previous year ( 1992-2005 ) . The Allergy , Asthma , and Immunology Center of Alaska reported a threefold increase in patient front 1999 to 2002 to 2003 to 2007 . A retrospective review of the Alaska Medicaid database from 1999 to 2006 showed increase in medical claim for insect reaction among all region , with the largest percentage of increase occurring in the host northern area . Increases in insect reaction in Alaska have occurred after increase in annual and winter temperature , and these finding may be causally related .

aVTemperature profile from the active layer have been analysed for 2 site on the composed rockglacier Morenas Coloraclas . Cordon del Plata , Mendoza , Argentina , using monitoring data collected between 1989 and 2008 in order to characterize the impact of global warming in the cryolithozone of the Dry Andes at these latitude ( 32 degrees-33 degree S ) . A significant change in the active layer and suprapermafrost of this rockglacier of the Cordon del Plata is registered at the monitoring site . The observed change imply direct consequence for the cryogenic environment and the Andean creeping permafrost . The nose of the Morenas Coloradas rockglacier for example ( Balcon I , 3560 m a.s.l . ) , already express inactivity ; the permafrost table is found at great depth ( 7.5-9 m ) . Data collected at Balcon I and II allow to estimate the theoretical thermal diffusivity alpha at the active layer of Morenas Coloraclas . Thermal diffusivity may be decisive for the study of cryogenic dynamic at other altitude and latitude in the region where data are still scarce . Low alpha value ( < 0.2 x 10 ( -6 ) m ( 2 ) /s ) correlate with occurrence of freezing and ice at low altitude . While the glacier are turning into small insignificant body in the high mountain , the periglacial level with creeping permafrost and linked with rockglaciers is expanding altitudinally , passing a transitional `` rooting '' area which is indirectly feeding the rockglaciers with their covered or `` dead ice '' . The ice of glacigenic origin contributes to the genesis of this type of permafrost . As the permafrost table is found at greater depth , the rockglaciers need to be monitored in order to define a balance between the upper periglacial level ( in term of altitude ) with mountain continuous-quasi continuous permafrost and the lower periglacial level to where the lowest front of creeping permafrost are reaching . The variation of the cryogenic structure of the rockglaciers of the Cordon del Plata caused by warming process , will have direct consequence for the volume of frozen sediment and therefore for the hydrology of the entire region , a fact that ha to be taken into account for future socio-economic program of the respective provincial government .

aVTwo research method were used in this study to analyze the awareness and perception of the Dutch general public regarding Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage ( CCS ) . In an Information-Choice Questionnaire ( ICQ ) , a representative sample of the Dutch public ( n = 995 ) wa provided with all information on attribute of six CCS option , which expert deemed necessary to come to well-considered and well-informed opinion . A traditional questionnaire wa used simultaneously ( n = 327 ) to study uninformed evaluation of these technology . The result showed that the Dutch public is mostly unaware of CCS and ha little knowledge about how current energy use cause global warming . Uninformed respondent are still inclined to give their opinion however , which result in unpredictive , easily changeable opinion . ICQ respondent who processed information on attribute of CCS option were likely to base their option evaluation on this information , though not entirely . All in all , the result of the ICQ suggest that , after processing information deemed necessary by expert , Dutch people reluctantly agree with large scale implementation of each of the six CCS option .

aVAs Earth continues to warm globally , there is a need to conduct ecosystem plot warming experiment under condition a representative of open field in the future a possible . One promising approach is to use hexagonal array of infrared heater such a described by [ Kimball , B.A. , Conley , M.M. , Wang , S. , Lin , X. , Luo , C. , Morgan , J. , Smith , D. , 2008 . Infrared heater array for warming ecosystem field plot . Global Change Biology 14 , 309-320 ] . However , their plot were only 3 m in diameter ( 7.1 m ( 2 ) ) , which limit the stature of vegetation to shorter than about 1 m and also limit the amount of plant material that can destructively harvested . Therefore , we tested a larger hexagonal 5-m diameter array of infrared heater , which provided a near tripling of useable area ( 19.6 m ( 2 ) ) . The number of heater wa tripled from 6 to 18 , and their height above the vegetative ( wheat ) canopy wa scaled with the diameter ( 0.4 time diameter = 2.0 m ) . Distributions of down-going thermal radiation and of the resultant warming of the vegetation were quite uniform across the plot . Moreover , the same equation previously determined from 3-m diameter plot to describe the thermal radiation efficiency a a function of wind speed wa still applicable . Thus , no problem were encountered in tripling the area of the infrared heater-warmed plot . Published by Elsevier B.V

aVThe upper Midwest USA feature glacial-derived till material enriched in carbonate mineral , but with the uppermost soil layer progressively leached of carbonate in the interval since glaciation . Groundwaters and groundwater-fed surface water are profoundly influenced by carbonate mineral dissolution . Stable carbon isotope composition of soil water and groundwaters in two southern Michigan watershed ( Huron and Kalamazoo ) were studied a a function of pH , delta ( 13 ) C ( CO2 ) , type of weathering reaction ( silicate vs. carbonate ) , and degree of isotope equilibration . This comprehensive study of carbon isotope biogeochemistry in the vadose zone , including soil gas , soil water/groundwater , and soil ( organic matter/carbonate phase ) , elucidates relation between the chemical weathering rate and CO ( 2 ) flux in the soil zone . Such information is important to evaluate response of terrestrial ecosystem to global climate change . In shallow soil zone where only silicate weathering wa occurring , respiratory CO ( 2 ) wa the major source of soil water DIC with little addition from the atmospheric CO ( 2 ) . Isotopic equilibration between delta ( 13 ) C ( DIC ) and delta ( 13 ) C ( CO2 ) occurred in an open system with respect to Soil CO ( 2 ) . In the deeper soil horizon carbonate dissolution dominated soil water chemistry and saturation with respect to calcite and dolomite wa attained rapidly . Mass balance calculation showed that large amount of soil CO ( 2 ) were consumed by carbonate dissolution , such that the deeper soil zone may not have been an open system with respect to CO ( 2 ) . Constant delta ( 13 ) C ( DIC ) value ( similar to - 11 part per thousand ) were observed in these deep soil water and also in shallow groundwaters of the Huron watershed . Thus , isotopic equilibrium might not be reached between DIC and CO ( 2 ) , possibly due to a rapid kinetics of carbonate dissolution and limited gas-water exchange in the soil . if so , DIC wa equally contributed by carbonate mineral ( delta ( 13 ) C ( CaCO3 ) = 0 part per thousand ) in reaction with soil CO ( 2 ) ( delta ( 13 ) C ( CO2 ) = -22 part per thousand ) . Soils beneath an agricultural site with a wheat/corn/soybean rotation ( the Kalamazoo watershed ) displayed a wide range in delta ( 13 ) C ( CO2 ) value ( -22 to -12 part per thousand ) , and the delta ( 13 ) C ( DIC ) of deeper soil water in contact with carbonate mineral wa controlled by seasonal variation of delta ( 13 ) C ( CO2 ) a well a by strong acid produced by nitrification and to a lesser degree by pyrite oxidation , both of which could react to dissolve carbonate mineral , in addition to carbonic acid dissolution .

aVIn this paper the mid-21st-century target level for industrial carbon dioxide emission is analyzed , taking into account the very large uncertainty about abrupt climate change . Following a brief review of integrated assessment of abrupt climate change , this study introduces an extension of DICE-2007 , an integrated assessment model for climate policy analysis , which contains a hazard function that connects the rise in air temperature with the probability of abrupt change . The probability of abrupt change under a certain air temperature condition and the economic impact of abrupt change are treated a widely variable parameter . Graphic indication of the combination of these parameter for several emission target using the extended model show the necessity of developing adaptation measure to control the economic loss from abrupt change to below 8 % , a well a to restrain global industrial carbon emission in 2055 to the same level a those in 2005 , assuming a most likely equilibrium climate sensitivity of 3 degree C. Although a more stringent emission target may be suggested in the spirit of precaution , it may lead to excessive carbon reduction from the viewpoint of cost-benefit balancing .

aVThis paper is the first of a two-part series that present result of a comprehensive study of the Variations ill the annual number of landfalling tropical cyclone ( ATCs ) in various part of East Asia during the period 1945-2004 . The objective is to identify possible trend and cycle in such variation . from inter-annual to inter-decadal , and the possible reason for such variation . The East Asian region is divided into three sub-regions : South ( south China , Vietnam and the Philippines ) , Middle ( east China ) , and North ( Korean Peninsula and Japan ) . Variations in the annual number oil various time scale in each region are examined separately . Part I report oil the result of wavelet analysis of the time series of the annual number in each region , and Part II examines the possible reason for the cycle identified in Part I . An important finding front the time series analysis is that none of the ATC time series show a significant linear trend . Which suggests that global warming ha not led to a higher frequency of landfalling tropical cyclone or typhoon in any of the region in Asia . Instead . each time series show large inter-annual ( 2-8 year ) and multi-decadal ( 16-32 year ) variation . In some period . the annual number of ATCs varies ill unison among all region of Asia . In others . one region would have an above-normal number of landfalling event , while the other region have below-normal number . In general . at multi-decadal time scale , the number of ATCs in each region correlate very well with that of the total number of tropical cyclone over the western North Pacific .

aVIt is well known that UV radiation can cause deleterious effect to the physiological performance , growth and specie assemblage of marine primary producer . In this review we describe the range of interaction observed between these impact of ultraviolet radiation ( UVR , 280-400 nm ) with other environmental factor such a the availability of photosynthetically active radiation ( PAR ) , nutrient status and level of dissolved CO ( 2 ) , all of which can , in turn , be influenced by global climate change . Thus , increase in CO ( 2 ) level can affect the sensitivity of some specie to UV-B radiation ( UV-B ) , while others show no such impact on UV-B susceptibility . Both nitrogen-and phosphorus-limitation can have direct interactive effect on the susceptibility of algal cell and community to UVR , though such effect are somewhat variable . Nutrient depletion can also potentially lead to a dominance of smaller celled specie , which may be le able to screen out and are thus likely to be more susceptible to UVR-induced damage . The variability of response to such interaction can lead to alteration in the specie composition of algal assemblage .

aVArboviruses are arthropod-borne virus , which include West Nile fever virus ( WNFV ) , a mosquito-borne virus , Rift Valley fever virus ( RVFV ) , a mosquito-borne virus , and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus ( CCHFV ) , a tick-borne virus . These arthropod-borne virus can cause disease in different domestic and wild animal and in human , posing a threat to public health because of their epidemic and zoonotic potential . In recent decade , the geographical distribution of these disease ha expanded . Outbreaks of WNF have already occurred in Europe , especially in the Mediterranean basin . Moreover , CCHF is endemic in many European country and serious outbreak have occurred , particularly in the Balkans , Turkey and Southern Federal Districts of Russia . In 2000 , RVF wa reported for the first time outside the African continent , with case being confirmed in Saudi Arabia and Yemen . This spread wa probably caused by ruminant trade and highlight that there is a threat of expansion of the virus into other part of Asia and Europe . In the light of global warming and globalisation of trade and travel , public interest in emerging zoonotic disease ha increased . This is especially evident regarding the geographical spread of vector-borne disease . A multi-disciplinary approach is now imperative , and group need to collaborate in an integrated manner that includes vector control , vaccination programme , improved therapy strategy , diagnostic tool and surveillance , public awareness , capacity building and improvement of infrastructure in endemic region .

aVThe major uncertainty in the climate change impact study inherits from applying the prediction of General Circulation Models ( GCMs ) . Different result might be obtained by using various GCMs ' prediction , which cause difficulty on the decision making of water resource management . This study proposed an integrated hydrological simulation and optimization framework , consisting of a fuzzy linear programming model with interval number , a streamflow simulation model , and agricultural water demand projection , to evaluate the impact of climate change on reservoir active storage . The reservoir inflow are simulated by the WatBal model , while agricultural water demand are predicted based on the projected change of potential evapotranspiration . Inflows and water demand are used to formulate an interval number fuzzy linear programming model . Fuzzy relationship are used to describe tolerable deficit of water resource , and the interval number is employed to indicate range of possible inflow and water demand . This systematic framework is applied to study the Tsengwen reservoir watershed to provide an optimal interval of active storage . The result further indicate the higher tolerable deficit , the smaller difference between superior and inferior active storage .

aVUsing long-term ( 1871-2005 ) summer monsoon rainfall data over 30 meteorological subdivision of India , overall tendency of the rainfall have been studied . Further , the subseasonal ( monthly ) trend have been evaluated . For this purpose , simple linear regression technique is applied . To examine the trend in different segment for summer monsoon rainfall , 11-year running average are calculated . Most of the subdivision reveal systematic increasing and decreasing trend in different segment of the time series . India experienced wet monsoon condition during the late 1950s and dry monsoon condition around the early 1900s . In the global warming era ( 1970-2005 ) , 19 out of 30 meteorological subdivision showed negative tendency in summer monsoon rainfall . This decrease in summer monsoon rainfall is associated with a weakening of the Southern Oscillation and relaxation of the meridional temperature gradient over the Indian Ocean . The gamma distribution is used to study the distribution of the rainfall by calculating scale and shape parameter . In general , larger value of scale parameter are found over west coast during summer monsoon and individual month . The shape parameter is high over northeast India .

aVEuphrasia nankotaizanensis is an endangered flowering plant distributed restrictedly on rocky slope of high mountain peak in central and northern Taiwan . In order to undertake a conservation program , especially given impact of the global warming , it is essential to evaluate it genetic diversity and population structure . We described nine novel microsatellite primer pair in E. nankotaizanensis and also examined it relative E. transmorrisonensis . The number of allele per locus ranged from 7 to 29 . Expected ( H ( E ) ) and observed ( H ( O ) ) heterozygosity ranged from 0.83 to 0.98 and 0.00 to 0.95 , respectively . Eight of the nine microsatellite locus displayed significant departure from Hardy-Weinberg expectation , likely due to the loss of habitat and the small population size . Significant linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) wa detected in most locus . Cross-species amplification of microsatellites took place at five locus . These primer may provide a tool for understanding the demography and population structure of Euphrasia specie in Taiwan .

aVResponse of soil organic carbon ( SOC ) to global climate change can have important implication to future environment . Soil organic carbon model that provide reliable prediction of SOC change in response to changing management , vegetation , and climatic condition can serve a useful tool for developing and assessing land management practice that improve soil quality and sustainability and promote soil carbon sequestration . Most model of SOC dynamic based on the concept of homogeneous SOC compartment face the problem of disconnection between conceptual kinetic SOC compartment and measurable SOC fraction . In addition , most kinetic parameter can not be determined experimentally for specific site and soil condition . Feng ( 2009 ) developed a new theoretical framework of SOC dynamic based on three fundamental assumption : the possibility of steady state , linearity , and rate-time equivalence . A single SOC decomposition function , the R function , form the basis of SOC prediction . This article develops the mathematical theory of a process-based , continuous model ( K-model ) of the R function . The model is developed by considering three basic step in SOC decomposition : the initial decomposition of plant litter and utilization of it carbon by soil microorganism , death of microorganism , and decomposition and recycling of dead microbial residue . Death of microorganism and subsequent decomposition of the dead microbial residue form a continuous cycle ( the MD cycle ) that lead to stabilization of C in soil . The model identifies a specific set of parameter that can be determined experimentally. , making possible for site-specific parameterization and simulation .

aVRivers link ocean with the land , creating global hot spot of carbon processing in coastal sea . Coastlines around the world are dominated by sandy beach , but beach are unusual in that they are thought to rely almost exclusively on marine import for food . No significant connection to terrestrial production having been demonstrated . By contrast , we isotopically traced carbon and nitrogen pathway leading to clam ( Donax deltoides ) on beach . Clams from area influenced by river plume had significantly different isotope signature ( delta ( 13 ) C : -18.5 to -20.2aEuro degree ; delta ( 15 ) N : 8.3-10.0aEuro degree ) compared with clam remote from plume ( delta ( 13 ) C : -17.5 to -19.5aEuro degree ; delta ( 15 ) N : 7.6-8.7aEuro degree ) , showing that terrestrial carbon and sewage , both delivered in river plume , penetrate beach food web . This is a novel mechanism of trophic subsidy in marine intertidal system , linking the world 's largest shore ecosystem to continental watershed . The same clam also carry pollution signature of sewage discharged into river , demonstrating that coastal river connect ecosystem in unexpected way and transfer contaminant across the land-ocean boundary . The link we demonstrate between terrigenous matter and the largest of all marine intertidal ecosystem are significant given the immense social , cultural , and economic value of beach to human and the predicted consequence of altered river discharge to coastal sea caused by global climate change .

aVAccounting of greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emission from waste landfilling is summarized with the focus on process and technical data for a number of different landfilling technology : open dump ( which wa included a the worst-case-scenario ) , conventional landfill with flare and with energy recovery , and landfill receiving low-organic-carbon waste . The result showed that direct emission of GHG from the landfill system ( primarily dispersive release of methane ) are the major contribution to the GHG accounting , up to about 1000 kg CO ( 2 ) -eq.tonne ( -1 ) for the open dump , 300 kg CO ( 2 ) -eq.tonne ( -1 ) for conventional landfilling of mixed waste and 70 kg CO ( 2 ) -eq.tonne ( -1 ) for low-organic-carbon waste landfill . The load caused by indirect , upstream emission from provision of energy and material to the landfill wa low , here estimated to be up to 16 kg CO ( 2 ) -eq.tonne ( -1 ) . On the other hand , utilization of landfill gas for electricity generation contributed to major saving , in most case , corresponding to about half of the load caused by direct GHG emission from the landfill . However , this saving can vary significantly depending on what the generated electricity substitute for . Significant amount of biogenic carbon may still be stored within the landfill body after 100 year , which here is counted a a saved GHG emission . With respect to landfilling of mixed waste with energy recovery , the net , average GHG accounting ranged from about -70 to 30 kg CO ( 2 ) -eq.tonne ( -1 ) , obtained by summing the direct and indirect ( upstream and downstream ) emission and accounting for stored biogenic carbon a a saving . However , if binding of biogenic carbon wa not accounted for , the overall GHG load would be in the range of 60 to 300 kg CO ( 2 ) -eq.tonne ( -1 ) . This paper clearly show that electricity generation a well a accounting of stored biogenic carbon are crucial to the accounting of GHG of waste landfilling .

aVThe Late Neogene represents warm Earth condition immediately prior to the development of extensive northern hemisphere glaciation , and this period in Earth history may therefore provide the best available analog for the projected outcome of continued global warming . There are few interior continental site of Late Neogene age from the eastern half of North America and subsequently very little is known about the condition characterizing climate . The Early Pliocene ( similar to 5 Ma ) Pipe Creek Sinkhole ( PCS ) includes the sediment fill of a complex karst environment that developed in north-central Indiana , USA ( Lat . 40 degree 27 ' 25.4 '' . Long . 85 degree 47 ' 37.2 '' ) . The site includes more than 3 m of high-chroma , red-colored silty-clay sediment interpreted to be terra rossa . The terra rossa delta ( 13 ) C value average -20 +/- 0.7 part per thousand PDB and are interpreted to represent sediment deposited in a closed cave system under high summer temperature and with well-drained soil . An in-situ paleosol at the top of the terra rossa represents a transition from a closed cave to an open environment that eventually flooded , thereby becoming a small pond . delta ( 13 ) C value from lacustrine sediment with organic matter derived dominantly from algae average -20.6 part per thousand and suggest the pond wa stagnant and enriched with bicarbonate from the underlying limestone or via aquifer . Pond sediment include abundant vertebrate fossil , which are broadly consistent with those inhabiting an open ecosystem such a a savannah or parkland . However , the PCS pollen includes low taxonomic diversity that is dominated by pine with some hickory and flowering plant , but no grass pollen . We propose two hypothesis to explain the PCS stratigraphic record : ( 1 ) The pollen assemblage may represent a local pine dominated ecosystem associated with the pond paleoenvironment , such a a riparian community , and that the greater landscape wa drier and open ; ( 2 ) Alternatively , the climate may have became wetter raising the elevation of the groundwater table and initiating the formation of the pond . Then in response to the wetter condition an early succession forest ecosystem developed . ( C ) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All right reserved .

aVThe poplar bioenergy system ha been analysed applying life cycle assessment ( LCA ) to compare it environmental performance to : Ethiopian mustard bioenergy system and natural gas . The life cycle impact assessment ( LCIA ) show that the use of fertilizer is the highest impact in four of the 10 environmental category , representing between 39 % and 67 % of the impact in them . The diesel used in transport vehicle and agricultural tractor also ha a significant impact in another five of the 10 analysed category 40-85 % . The poplar bioenergy system contributes to global warming with 1-90-1.98 gCO ( 2 ) eq MJ ( -1 ) biomass produced . The production and transport a far a the thermoelectric plant of the poplar biomass consumes 0.02 MJ of primary energy per 1 MJ of biomass stored . In comparison with Ethiopian mustard and natural gas , it reduces primary energy consumption by 83 % and 89 % and the greenhouse gas emission by 84 % and 89 % , respectively . The result of the analysis support that the poplar bioenergy system is viable from an energy balance and environmental perspective for producing energy in southern Europe , a long a it is cultivated in area where water is available . This latter point and the better environmental performance of both crop in comparison to natural gas allows u to affirm that the combination of several crop adapted to the local agro-climatic condition of the territory will be the most suitable strategy in Mediterranean area that wish to reach the global energy production target in term of biomass established by the European Union ( EU ) .

aVBackground : Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common cause of community acquired pneumonia and bacteremia . Excess wintertime mortality related to pneumonia ha been noted for over a century , but the seasonality of invasive pneumococcal disease ( IPD ) ha been described relatively recently and is poorly understood . Improved understanding of environmental influence on disease seasonality ha taken on new urgency due to global climate change . Methods : We evaluated 602 case of IPD reported in Philadelphia County , Pennsylvania , from 2002 to 2007 . Poisson regression model incorporating seasonal smoother were used to identify association between weekly weather pattern and case count . Associations between acute ( day-to-day ) environmental fluctuation and IPD occurrence were evaluated using a case-crossover approach . Effect modification across age and sex stratum wa explored , and meta-regression model were created using stratum-specific estimate for effect . Results : IPD incidence wa greatest in the wintertime , and spectral decomposition revealed a peak at 51.0 week , consistent with annual periodicity . After adjustment for seasonality , yearly increase in reporting , and temperature , weekly incidence wa found to be associated with clear-sky UV index ( IRR per unit increase in index : 0.70 [ 95 % CI 0.54-0.91 ] ) . The effect of UV index wa highest among young stratum and decreased with age . At shorter time scale , only an association with increase in ambient sulphur oxide wa linked to disease risk ( OR for highest tertile of exposure 0.75 , 95 % CI 0.60 to 0.93 ) . Conclusion : We confirmed the wintertime predominance of IPD in a major urban center . The major predictor of IPD in Philadelphia is extended period of low UV radiation , which may explain observed wintertime seasonality . The mechanism of action of diminished light exposure on disease occurrence may be due to direct effect on pathogen survival or host immune function via altered 1,25- ( OH ) ( 2 ) -vitamin-D metabolism . These finding may suggest le diminution in future IPD risk with climate change than would be expected if wintertime seasonality wa driven by temperature .

aVPermafrost area receive more and more attention in term of natural hazard in recent year due to ongoing global warming . Active rockglaciers are mixture of debris and ice ( of different origin ) in high-relief environment indicating permafrost condition for a substantial period of time . Style and velocity of the downward movement of this debrisice-mass is influenced by topoclimatic condition . The rockglacier Hinteres Langtalkar is stage of extensive modification in the last decade a a consequence of an extraordinary high surface movement . Terrestrial laserscanning ( or LiDAR ) campaign have been out once or twice per year since 2000 to monitor surface dynamic at the highly active front of the rockglacier . High resolution digital terrain model are the basis for annual and inter-annual analysis of surface elevation change . Results show that the observed area show predominantly positive surface elevation change causing a consequent lifting of the surface over the entire period . Nevertheless a decreasing surface lifting of the observed area in the last three year lead to the assumption that the material transport from the upper part decline in the last year . Furthermore the rockglacier front is characterized by extensive mass wasting and partly disintegration of the rockglacier body . As indicated by the LiDAR result a well a from field evidence , this rockglacier front seems to represent a permafrost influenced landslide .

aVBagasse is mostly utilized for steam and power production For domestic sugar mill . There have been a number of alternative that could Well be applied to manage bagasse , such a pulp production , conversion to biogas and electricity production . The selection of proper alternative depends significantly on the appropriateness of the technology both from the technical and the environmental point of view . This work proposes a simple model based on the application of life cycle assessment ( LCA ) to evaluate the environmental impact , of various alternative for dealing with bagasse waste . The environmental aspect Of concern included global warming potential , acidification potential , eutrophication potential and photochemical oxidant creation . Four waste management scenario for bagasse were evaluated : landfilling with utilization of landfill gas , anaerobic digestion with biogas production , incineration for power generation , and pulp production . In landfill , environmental impact depended significantly on the biogas collection efficiency , whereas incineration of bagasse to electricity in the power plant showed better environmental performance than that of conventional low biogas collection efficiency landfill . Anaerobic digestion of bagasse in a control biogas reactor wa superior to the other two energy generation option in all environmental aspect . Although the use of bagasse in pulp mill created relatively high environmental burden , the result from the LCA revealed that other stage of the life cycle produced relatively small impact and that this option might be the most environmentally benign alternative .

aVThe main primary energy for electricity in Thailand is natural gas , accounting for 73 % of the grid mix . Electricity generation from natural gas combustion is associated with substantial air emission . The two technology currently used in Thailand , thermal and combined cycle power plant , have been evaluated for the potential environmental impact in a `` cradle-to-grid '' study according to the life cycle assessment ( LCA ) method . This study evaluates the environmental impact of each process of the natural gas power production over the entire life cycle and compare two different power plant technology currently used in Thailand , namely , combined cycle and thermal . LCA is used a a tool for the assessment of resource consumption and associated impact generated from utilization of natural gas in power production . The detail follow the methodology outlined in ISO 14040 . The scope of this research includes natural gas extraction , natural gas separation , natural gas transmission , and natural gas power production . Most of the inventory data have been collected from Thailand , except for the upstream of fuel oil and fuel transmission , which have been computed from Greenhouse gas , Regulated Emissions , and Energy use in Transportation version 1.7 and Global Emission Model for Integrated Systems version 4.3 . The impact category considered are global warming , acidification , photochemical ozone formation , and nutrient enrichment potential ( NEP ) . The comparison reveals that the combined cycle power plant , which ha a higher efficiency , performs better than the thermal power plant for global warming potential ( GWP ) , acidification potential ( ACP ) , and photochemical ozone formation potential ( POCP ) , but not for NEP where the thermal power plant is preferable . For the thermal power plant , the most significant environmental impact are from power production followed by upstream of fuel oil , natural gas extraction , separation , and transportation . For the combined cycle power plant , the most significant environmental impact are from power production followed by natural gas extraction , separation , and transportation . The significant difference between the two type of power production is mainly from the combustion process and feedstock in power plant . The thermal power plant us a mix of natural gas ( 56 % by energy content ) and fuel oil ( 44 % by energy content ) ; whereas , the combined cycle power plant operates primarily on natural gas . The largest contribution to GWP , ACP , and NEP is from power production for both thermal a well a combined cycle power plant . The POCP for the thermal power plant is also from power production ; whereas , for combined cycle power plant , it is mainly from transmission of natural gas . In this research , we have examined the environmental impact of electricity generation technology between thermal and combined cycle natural gas power plant . This is the overview of the whole life cycle of natural gas power plant , which will help in decision making . The result of this study will be useful for future power plant a natural gas is the major feedstock being promoted in Thailand for power production . Also , these result will be used in further research for comparison with other feedstock and power production technology .

aVChina ha been the largest primary magnesium producer in the world since year 2000 and is an important part of the global magnesium supply chain . Almost all of the primary magnesium in China is produced using the Pidgeon process invented in the 1940s in Canada . The environmental problem of the primary magnesium production with the Pidgeon process have already attracted much attention of the local government and enterprise . The main purpose of this research are to investigate the environmental impact of magnesium production and to determine the accumulative environmental performance of three different scenario . System boundary included the cradle-to-gate life cycle of magnesium production , including dolomite ore extraction , ferrosilicon production , the Pidgeon process , transportation of material , and emission from thermal power plant . The life cycle assessment ( LCA ) case study wa performed on three different fuel use scenario from coal a the overall fuel to two kind of gaseous fuel , the producer gas and coke oven gas . The burden use of gaseous fuel wa also considered . The procedure , detail , and result obtained are based on the application of the existing international standard of LCA , i.e. , the ISO 14040 . Depletion of abiotic resource , global warming , acidification , and human toxicity were adopted a the midpoint impact category developed by the problem-oriented approach of CML to estimate the characterized result of the case study . The local characterization and normalization factor of abiotic resource were used to calculate abiotic depletion potential ( ADP ) . The analytic hierarchy process wa used to determine the weight factor . Using the Umberto version 4.0 , the emission of dolomite ore extraction were estimated and the transportation model of the three scenario were designed . The emission inventory showed that both the Pidgeon process of magnesium production and the Fe-Si production were mainly to blame for the total pollutant emission in the life cycle of magnesium production . The characterized result indicated that ADP , acidification potential , and human toxicity potential decreased cumulatively from scenario 1 to 3 , with the exception of global warming potential . The final single score indicated that the accumulative environmental performance of scenario 3 wa the best compared with scenario 1 and 2 . The impact of abiotic resource depletion deserves more attention although the type and the amount of mineral resource for Mg production are abundant in China . This study suggested that producer gas wa an alternative fuel for magnesium production rather than the coal burned directly in area where the cost of oven gas-produced coke is high . The utilization of `` clean '' energy and the reduction of greenhouse gas and acidic gas emission were the main goal of the technological improvement and cleaner production of the magnesium industry in China . This paper ha demonstrated that the theory and method of LCA are actually helpful for the research on the accumulative environmental performance of primary magnesium production . Further study with `` cradle-to-cradle '' scheme are recommended . Furthermore , other energy source used in magnesium production and the cost of energy production could be treated in further research .

aVThis paper compare the life cycle assessment ( LCA ) of two packaging alternative used for baby food produced by Nestl , : plastic pot and glass jar . The study considers the environmental impact associated with packaging system used to provide one baby food meal in France , Spain , and Germany in 2007 . In addition , alternate logistical scenario are considered which are independent of the two packaging option . The 200-g packaging size is selected a the basis for this study . Two other packaging size are assessed in the sensitivity analysis . Because result are intended to be disclosed to the public , this study underwent a critical review by an external panel of LCA expert . The LCA is performed in accordance to the international standard ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 . The packaging system include the packaging production , the product assembly , the preservation process , the distribution , and the packaging end-of-life . The production of the content ( before preservation process ) , a well a the use phase are not taken into account a they are considered not to change when changing packaging . The inventory is based on data obtained from the baby food producer and the supplier , data from the scientific literature , and data from the ecoinvent database . Special care is taken to implement a system expansion approach for end-of-life open and closed loop recycling and energy production ( ISO 14044 ) . A comprehensive impact assessment is performed using two life cycle impact assessment methodology : IMPACT 2002+ and CML 2001 . An extensive uncertainty analysis using Monte Carlo a well a an extensive sensitivity study are performed on the inventory and the reference flow , respectively . When looking at the impact due to preservation process and packaging ( considering identical distribution distance ) , we observe a small but significant environmental benefit of the plastic pot system over the glass jar system . Depending on the country , the impact is reduced by 14 % to 27 % for primary energy , 28 % to 31 % for global warming , 31 % to 34 % for respiratory inorganics , and 28 % to 31 % for terrestrial acidification/nutrification . The environmental benefit associated with the change in packaging mainly result from ( a ) production of plastic pot ( including it end-of-life ; 43 % to 51 % of total benefit ) , ( b ) lighter weight of packaging positively impacting transportation ( 20 % to 35 % of total benefit ) , and ( c ) new preservation process permitted by the plastic system ( 23 % to 34 % of total benefit ) . The jar or pot ( including cap or lid , cluster , stretch film , and label ) represents approximately half of the life cycle impact , the logistics approximately one fourth , and the rest ( especially on-site energy , tray , and hood ) one fourth . The sensitivity analysis show that assumption made in the basic scenario are rather conservative for plastic pot and that the conclusion for the 200-g packaging size also apply to other packaging size . The uncertainty analysis performed on the inventory for the German market situation show that the plastic pot system ha le impact than the glass jar system while considering similar distribution distance with a confidence level above 97 % for most impact category . There is opportunity for further improvement independent of the type of packaging used , such a by reducing distribution distance while still optimizing lot size . The validity of the main conclusion presented in this study is confirmed by result of both impact assessment methodology IMPACT 2002+ and CML 2001 . For identical transportation distance , the plastic pot system show a small but significant reduction in environmental burden compared to the glass jar system . As food distribution play an important role in the overall life cycle burden and may vary between scenario , it is important to avoid additional transportation of the packaged food in order to maintain or even improve the advantage of the plastic pot system . The present study focus on the comparison of packaging system and directly related consequence . It is recommended that further environmental optimization of the product also includes food manufacturing ( before preservation process ) and the supply chain of raw material .

aVIn this study , we evaluate the environmental effect of wood-based household heating . Wood is a significant source of household heating in Norway , and a comparative life cycle assessment of a wood-based heating system using an old and a modern stove wa conducted to estimate the total life cycle benefit associated with the change from old to new combustion technology . The study us a new approach to complete the inventory . Input-output data are used in combination with the Leontief price model to estimate input of product and service from the background economy to the birch wood supply chain . When comparing new and old stove technology , the result show that the new technology contributes to a significantly improved performance ( 28-80 % ) for all type of environmental impact studied . As there is a large share of old wood stove still in use , replacing the old stove with new one can lead to substantial reduction in environmental impact , especially impact affecting human health . The use phase , i.e. , wood combustion , is responsible for over 60 % of the impact within all category . Both the old and new stove provide heating with emission of greenhouse gas ranging from one third ( new stove , similar to 80 g CO ( 2 ) -eq/kWh ) to half ( old stove , similar to 110 g CO ( 2 ) -eq/kWh ) of the impact compared to electricity use from the Nordic electricity mix ( similar to 210 g CO ( 2 ) -eq/kWh ) to heat the house . Combustion of the wood is found to be most important for all type of impact , even for global warming , where the CO ( 2 ) emission from combustion are treated a `` climate neutral . '' Products of incomplete combustion are the reason for this , a well a the high contribution to other impact category . Emission factor for these substance are subject to high uncertainty . Although the combustion phase is the most important stage in the life cycle , transportation distance can play an important role . To render wood a environmentally benign a possible , one should thus seek to shorten the distance from producer to consumer . There is a significant difference in the life cycle performance of a wood stove using modern technology versus older technology within all impact category . In addition , there is a preference to use locally produced firewood over wood transported over long distance . A strong emphasis on phasing out old woodstoves should be maintained and is well justified .

aVThe migration of enhancement in NO ( 2 ) concentration , outgoing longwave radiation ( OLR ) , and radiative effect associated with the onset of the North American Monsoon in July 2005 ha been investigated using satellite data and the Regional Chemical Transport Model ( REAM ) . The satellite data include the tropospheric NO ( 2 ) column , tropospheric O ( 3 ) profile , and OLR from OMI , TES and NOAA-16 satellite , respectively , for June and July 2005 . The simulated OLR capture the spatial distribution of the remotely sensed OLR field with relatively small bias ( = 0.88 ) . This study reveals that the lightning-generated NO ( x ) exerts a larger , by up to a factor of three , impact on OLR ( up to 0.35 Wm ( -2 ) ) and radiative effect ( up to 0.55 Wm ( -2 ) ) by enhancing O ( 3 ) in the upper troposphere than anthropogenic NO ( x ) that increase O ( 3 ) in the lower troposphere , despite the fact that the lightning-generated NO ( x ) and O ( 3 ) are much smaller than those from the anthropogenic emission . The radiative effect by lightning-derived upper tropospheric O ( 3 ) over the convective outflow region is affected by the change in lightning frequency . Thus the change in convection due to global warming may alter the geographical distribution and magnitude of the radiative effect of lightning-derived O ( 3 ) , and this paper is a first step in quantifying the current radiative impact .

aVThe lipid biomarker composition of microbial mat community from three meltwater pond from the McMurdo Ice Shelf , Antarctica , wa investigated for the first time . Hydrocarbons , ether-linked component , fatty acid ( FAs ) , wax ester , hopanols and sterol from Fresh , Orange and Salt Ponds were analysed . The dominance of cyanobacteria and the presence of bacterial sulfate reducer were confirmed using signature FAs in all three mat . Wax ester analysis suggested the presence of Chloroflexus spp . The dominance of short chain hydrocarbon , wax ester and FAs indicated that microorganism are the major source of organic matter in these meltwater pond . A variety of sterol were present in different relative abundance . The greatest diversity of sterol wa in Salt Pond , followed by Fresh Pond , which wa attributed to difference in the present eukaryotic diversity . Lipid profile of the three community were similar despite the presence of a salinity gradient . Analysis of lipid biomarkers allowed the creation of profile for these unique Antarctic cryo-ecosystems . This will assist in the comparison of present and past microbial community and in the monitoring of Antarctic biodiversity in response to global climate change and other environmental perturbation .

aVThe identification of adaptation and key innovation ha long interested biologist because they confer on organism the ability to exploit previously unavailable ecological resource and respond to novel selective pressure . Although it can be extremely difficult to test for the effect of a character on the rate of lineage diversification , the convergent evolution of a character in multiple lineage provides an excellent opportunity to test for the effect of that character on lineage diversification . Here , I examine the effect of parity mode on the diversification of viper , which have independently evolved viviparity in at least 13 lineage . I find strong statistical evidence that viviparous specie diversify at a greater rate than oviparous specie and correlate major decrease in the diversification rate of oviparous specie with period of global cooling , such a the Oligocene . These result suggest that the evolution of viviparity buffered live-bearing specie against the negative effect of global climate change during the Cenozoic , and wa a key innovation in the evolution and diversification of live-bearing viper .

aVThere is growing awareness that microevolutionary dynamic may alter ecological process . Rising temperature under global change are expected to open window for establishment of specie and genotype from warmer region . Yet , microevolutionary tracking of temperature change by local population may reduce establishment success of these immigrant . We exposed a UK population of the water flea , Daphnia magna , to two temperature regime during a 1.5-year experimental evolution trial , and subsequently compared competitive strength of non-warm-adapted and warm-adapted D. magna in competition with French genotype . Our result indicate that local microevolutionary response to global warming may reduce establishment success of immigrant genotype that are preadapted to warmer climate . Simulation modeling show that microevolution result in a reduced likelihood and speed of displacement of local population by immigrant genotype under realistic immigrant/resident ratio . We conclude that local evolutionary dynamic may shift the relative impact of local and regional process in response to global change .

aVThe marine environment play an important role in controlling the amount of CO ( 2 ) that remains within the earth 's atmosphere , but it ha not received a much attention a the terrestrial environment regarding climate-change effect , mitigation programme , and action plan . Potential physical effect of climate change within the marine environment , including ocean acidification , change in wind that drive upwelling and ocean circulation pattern , increasing global sea surface temperature , and sea level rise , can result in dramatic change within marine and coastal ecosystem . Often , marine resource manager feel overwhelmed by the magnitude of this issue and are therefore uncertain how to begin to take action . It may seem that they do not have the time , funding , or staff to take on a challenge a large a climate change , and fail to act a a result . Using NOAA 's Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary a a case study , this paper outline the need to act now and present an easy-to-use process guide , providing manager option to incorporate effectively the influence of climate change into management strategy , a well a mitigate these influence through community outreach and a reduction in workplace emission .

aVAtmospheric concentration of greenhouse gas ( GHGs ) , prominently carbon dioxide ( CO ( 2 ) ) , methane ( CH ( 4 ) ) , nitrous oxide ( N ( 2 ) O ) , and halocarbon , have risen from fossil-fuel combustion , deforestation , agriculture , and industry . There is currently heated national and international debate about the consequence of such increasing concentration of GHGs on the Earth 's climate , and , ultimately , on life and society in the world a we know it . This paper review ( i ) long-term pattern of climate change , secular climatic variability , and predicted population growth and their relation to water resource management , and , specifically , to ground water resource management , ( ii ) mean available for mitigating and adapting to trend of climatic change and climatic variability and their impact on ground water resource . Long-term ( that is , over hundred of million of year ) , global-scale , climatic fluctuation are compared with more recent ( in the Holocene ) pattern of the global and regional climate to shed light on the meaning of rising mean surface temperature over the last century or so , especially in region whose historical hydroclimatic record exhibit large inter-annual variability . One example of regional ground water resource response to global warming and population growth is presented .

aVSuch high-resolution indirect data on solar activity a the ( 14 ) C and ( 10 ) Be cosmogenic isotope have been considered . The long-term solar activity cyclicity during the last millennium with period of approximately 90 and 210 year , which can be related to substantial climatic warming and cooling event in this millennium , ha been established based on an analysis of these data . It ha been indicated that long-term recent climate warming can result from the effect of the similar to 90- and similar to 210-year solar cycle on the climatic system , which is characterized by the nonlinear dynamic .

aVThe timing of uplift of the Tibet Plateau ha a central role in the development of tectonic model for the Tibet Plateau and Cenozoic global climate change . A detailed magnetostratigraphic study of the Dahonggou section , northern Qaidam Basin , reveal that the section span from similar to 34 to similar to 8.5 Ma and the age of the Shang Ganchaigou , Xia Youshashan and Shang Youshashan formation are from > 34 to 22-20 Ma , 22-20 to 13 Ma and 13 to < 8.5 Ma , respectively . Variations in lithofacies , sedimentation rate and magnetic susceptibility ( K ) suggest that the southern Qilian Shan wa tectonically inactive and did n't respond to the rapid slip on the Altyn Tagh Fault at 30 Ma . In contrast , the similar sedimentary record in the Dahonggou section , the Xishuigou section along the Altyn Tagh Fault , and even more locality along much of the Qilian range front imply that the Qilian Shan and the Altyn Tagh Fault were synchronously tectonically active at about 12 Ma . The lower K between similar to 12 Ma and similar to 8.5 Ma in the sediment of the Dahonggou section is interpreted to be due to long-distanced oxidation and sorting , which cause not only that magnetite wa oxidated to hematite , but also that magnetic mineral are enriched in fine-grained sediment and coarse-grained sediment bear few magnetic mineral .

aVChanges in carbon use efficiency ( CUE ) , which is defined a the ratio of net primary production ( NPP ) to gross primary production ( GPP ) , were analyzed for Abies veitchii Lindl . forest with respect to stand development by developing a simple mathematical model incorporating data on physiological variable and leaf mass ratio . A decrease in CUE with stand development wa successfully expressed a a function of stand biomass ( y ) based on the following three assumption : ( 1 ) a power-law relationship between mean respiration and mean individual tree mass , ( 2 ) a power-functional relationship between mean gross primary production and mean individual tree mass , and ( 3 ) self-thinning relationship between stand biomass and density . Based on this model , a parameter of CUE-y relationship wa defined , and it wa clarified that CUE decrease with stand development is caused not by the ratio of specific respiration rate to specific gross photosynthetic rate , but by leaf mass ratio . Since CUE is high in young forest , helpful information on selecting woody specie when planting seedling wa provided from the viewpoint of reducing CO ( 2 ) in the atmosphere and global warming .

aVRice-duck ( RD ) and rice-fish ( RF ) ecological system are major complex planting and breeding model of rice paddy field in southern China . Studying the methane ( CH ( 4 ) ) and nitrous oxide ( N ( 2 ) O ) emission and their economic value from these two ecosystem can provide theoretical and practical basis for further development and utilization of these classical agricultural technique . CH ( 4 ) and N ( 2 ) O emission from RD and RF ecological system were measured in situ by using static chamber technique . Using global warming potential ( GWPs ) , we assessed the greenhouse effect of CH ( 4 ) and N ( 2 ) O and their economic value . Results showed that the peak of CH ( 4 ) emission flux from RD and RF appeared at full tillering stage and at heading stage , and the average emission flux were significantly ( P < 0.05 ) lower than that from CK . N ( 2 ) O flux remained low when the field is flooded and high after draining the water . Compared with CK , the total amount of N ( 2 ) O emission wa significantly ( P < 0.05 ) higher and slightly lower than those from RD and RF , respectively . In 2006 and 2007 , the total greenhouse effect of CH ( 4 ) , and N ( 2 ) O from RD and RF were 4 728.3 and 4 611 kg CO ( 2 ) ha ( -1 ) , 4 545 and 4754.3 kg CO ( 2 ) ha ( -1 ) , respectively . The cost of greenhouse effect were 970.89 and 946.81 RMB yuan ha ( -1 ) , and 933.25 and 976.23 RMB yuan ha ( -1 ) , respectively , which were significant lower than those from CK ( 5997.6 and 5391.5 RMB yuan ha ( -1 ) ) . Except for the environment cost of CH ( 4 ) and N ( 2 ) O , the economic benefit from RD and RF were 2210.64 and 4881.92 RMB yuan ha ( -1 ) ; 3 798.37 and 5 310.64 RMB yuan ha ( -1 ) , respectively , higher than those from CK . Therefore , RD and RF complex ecological planting and breeding model can effectively decrease and control CH ( 4 ) and N ( 2 ) O emission , and they are two of the effective strategy to reduce greenhouse gas from rice paddy field and contribute in alleviating global warming . Thus , their adoption is important to the environment together with their economy benefit .

aVVariability of Mexican hydroclimate , with special attention to persistent drought , is examined using observation , model simulation forced by historical sea surface temperature ( SST ) , tree ring reconstruction of past climate and model simulation and projection of naturally and anthropogenically forced climate change . During the winter half year , hydroclimate across Mexico is influenced by the state of the tropical Pacific Ocean with the Atlantic playing little role . Mexican winter tend to be wetter during El Nino condition . In the summer half year northern Mexico is also wetter when El Nino condition prevail , but southern Mexico is drier . A warm tropical North Atlantic Ocean make northern Mexico dry and southern Mexico wet . These relationship are reasonably well reproduced in ensemble of atmosphere model simulation forced by historical SST for the period from 1856 to 2002 . Large ensemble of 100 day long integration are used to examine the day to day evolution of the atmospheric circulation and precipitation in response to a sudden imposition of a El Nino SST anomaly in the summer half year . Kelvin wave propagate east and immediately cause increased column-integrated moisture divergence and reduced precipitation over the tropical Americas and Intra-America Seas . Within a few day a low level high pressure anomaly develops over the Gulf of Mexico . A forced nonlinear model is used to demonstrate that this low is forced by the reduced atmospheric heating over the tropical Atlantic-Intra-America Seas area . Tree ring reconstruction that extend back before the period of instrumental precipitation data coverage are used to verify long model simulation forced by historical SST . The early to mid 1950s drought in northern Mexico appears to have been the most severe since the mid nineteenth century and likely arose a a response to both a multiyear La Nina and a warm tropical North Atlantic . A drought in the 1890s wa also severe and appears driven by a multiyear La Nina alone . The drought that began in the 1990s doe not exceed these drought in either duration or severity . Tree ring record extending back to the fourteenth century suggest that the late sixteenth century megadrought may have been the longest drought to have ever affected Mexico . While the last decade or so in north and central Mexico ha been drier than preceding decade , the associated continental pattern of hydroclimate change doe not fit that which model project to occur a a consequence of rising greenhouse gas and global warming . However , model robustly predict that Mexico will dry a a consequence of global warming and that this drying should already be underway . At least for now , in nature , this is likely obscured by strong natural atmosphere-ocean variability .

aVOstracode magnesium/calcium ( Mg/Ca ) -based bottom-water temperature were combined with benthic foraminiferal oxygen isotope in order to quantify the oxygen isotopic composition of seawater , and estimate continental ice volume and sea-level variability during the Mid-Pliocene warm period , ca 3.3 3.0 Ma . Results indicate that , following a low stand of approximately 65 m below present at marine isotope stage ( MIS ) M2 ( ca 3.3 Ma ) , sea level generally fluctuated by 20 30 m above and below a mean value similar to present-day sea level . In addition to the low-stand event at MIS M2 , significant low stand occurred at MIS KM2 ( -40 m ) , G22 ( -40 m ) and G16 ( -60 m ) . Six high stand of + 10 m or more above present day were also observed ; four event ( +10 , +25 , +15 and +30 m ) from MIS M1 to KM3 , a high stand of +15 m at MIS K1 , and a high stand of +25 m at MIS G17 . These result indicate that continental ice volume varied significantly during the Mid-Pliocene warm period and that at time there were considerable reduction of Antarctic ice .

aVBased on a recognition of the essence of climate change and the pressure on China to reduce it greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emission , this paper interprets the important role that the Chinese iron and steel industry may play in managing emission . Through an investigation of he key source of GHG emission in the Chinese iron and steel industry , a comparison of the current Chinese and international situation , and a survey of the technology and method available for reducing GHG emission , and their application in China , the author analyze the major issue currently faced by the Chinese iron and steel industry , and propose the following four approach through which the industry might reduce it GHG emission : ( 1 ) encouragement of clean development mechanism ( CDM ) project , mainly involving secondary energy reuse , to provide capital and technology for GHG reduction activity in China ; ( 2 ) stimulation of the social responsibility-based voluntary carbon market ( VCM ) to increase the long-term benefit for the Chinese iron and steel industry from emission reduction ; ( 3 ) undertaking of strict energy auditing to help enterprise establish appropriate emission reduction target and formulate reasonable plan : ( 4 ) promotion of emission reduction-oriented investment within the industry to obtain profit from project operation , while at the same time gaining extra compensation for emission reduction . More specifically , the design of each of these approach should take into consideration the related economic factor and incentive mechanism . ( C ) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVN ( 2 ) O emission from soil contribute significantly to global warming . Pulse emission of N ( 2 ) O from soil during freeze-thawing were recently recognized a important atmospheric source . In this modelling study we explore three different hypothesis for explaining freeze-thaw related N ( 2 ) O emission : ( I ) soil frost or snow cover may reduce gas diffusion and create anaerobic condition that stimulate N ( 2 ) O production via denitrification , ( 2 ) microbe that die of frost deliver easy decomposable organic carbon and nitrogen to the soil , which Stimulates microbial growth and vigorous N ( 2 ) O production during freeze-thaw , and ( 3 ) the enzyme nitrous oxide reductase , which is responsible for the reduction of N ( 2 ) O to N ( 2 ) during denitrification , is more sensitive to low temperature than other enzyme , so that N ( 2 ) O becomes the dominating end-product of denitrification at low temperature . These hypothesis were tested with a biogeochemical model that combine hydrology and physic calculation with a newly developed , parameter-poor biochemistry module . The model wa first calibrated with field datasets on soil-atmosphere flux of N ( 2 ) O , NO and CO ( 2 ) and soil NO ( 3 ) and NH ( 4 ) concentration that were measured in a spruce forest in Southeast Germany in the year 1994-1997 . Subsequently , additional model mechanism were implemented that allow the model to describe the outlined mechanism potentially driving freeze-thaw N ( 2 ) O flux . After each implementation the model wa recalibrated . We were able to mimic dimension and timing of high N ( 2 ) O emission when either one of the first two hypothesis were assumed , but found no confirmation for the third . The best model fit wa achieved by combining hypothesis one and two , indicating that freeze-thaw N ( 2 ) O emission are not mono-causal . ( C ) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All right reserved .

aVWe model coral community response to bleaching and mass mortality event which are predicted to increase in frequency with climate change . The model wa parameterized for the Arabian/Persian Gulf , but is generally applicable . We assume three specie group ( Acropora , faviids , and Porites ) in two life-stages each where the juvenile are in competition but the adult can enter a size-refuge in which they can not be competitively displaced . An aggressive group ( Acropora specie ) dominates at equilibrium , which is not reached due to mass mortality event that primarily disadvantage this group ( compensatory mortality , > 90 % versus 25 % in faviids and Porites ) roughly every 15 year . Population parameter ( N individual , carrying capacity ) were calculated from satellite imagery and in situ transects , vital rate ( fecundity , mortality , and survival ) were derived from the model , field observation , and literature . It is shown that population and unaltered community structure can persist despite repeated 90 % mortality , given sufficiently high fecundity of the remaining population or import from connected population . The frequency of disturbance determines the dominant group-in low frequency Acropora , in high frequency Porites . This is congruent with field observation . The model of an isolated population wa more sensitive to parameter change than that of connected population . Highest sensitivity wa to mortality rate and recruitment rate . Community composition wa sensitive to spacing of disturbance and level of catastrophic mortality . Decreased mortality led to Acropora dominance , increased mortality led to Acropora extinction . In nature , closely spaced disturbance have severely disadvantaged Acropora population over the last decade . Unless a longer ( > 10 year ) disturbance-free interval can be maintained , a permanent shift away from Acropora dominance will be observed . A mortality rate of 99 % in Acropora , a observed in 1996 , is not sustainable if repetitive and neither is a disturbance frequency < 15 years-each leading to population collapse . This show that the severity and/or the spacing of the 1996-1998-2002 disturbance were unusual in frequency and duration . ( C ) 2008 Elsevier B.V All right reserved .

aVYears of ill-managed irrigation have triggered secondary soil salinization in the Khorezm region of Uzbekistan located in the Aral Sea basin . To ass the magnitude and dynamic of secondary soil salinization , to quantify improved management strategy and to derive updated irrigation standard , the soil water model Hydrus-1D wa used . Water and soil salinity dynamic in three cotton field with different soil texture were monitored and simulated for the year 2003 and 2005 . Until now in Khorezm , overall soil salinity could only be controlled by pre-season salt leaching using high amount of water . This water , however , may not be available anymore in the near future because of global climate change and shrinking fresh water resource . Simulations confirmed that the present leaching practice is barely effective . At two out of the three location within a sandy loam field , leaching did not remove salt from the 2 m profile . Instead , salt were only shifted from the upper ( 0-0.8 m ) to the lower ( 0.8-2 m ) soil layer . Strong groundwater contribution to evapotranspiration triggered secondary ( re ) -salinization of the topsoil during the cropping season . As a consequence , salt amount in the top 0.8 m of soil increased from 9 to 22 Mg ha ( -1 ) in the field with loamy texture , and from 4 to 12 Mg ha ( -1 ) in the field with sandy texture . Management strategy analysis revealed that reducing soil evaporation by a surface residue layer would notably decrease secondary soil salinization . Here , owing to the reduced capillary rise of groundwater , post-season salt content of the three field were reduced by between 12 and 19 % when compared with residue-free condition . Even more effective would be improving the efficiency of the drainage system so a to lower the groundwater table . This would require a revision of the current irrigation management scheme , but could , a simulation revealed , reduce the post-season salt content in the 2 m soil profile of the three field by between 36 and 59 % when compared with unaltered condition . For the revised irrigation management in total not more water than already foreseen by national irrigation recommendation would be needed . Increasing leaching and irrigation efficiency would help sustaining the present cotton production level while reducing future leaching demand .

aVForest health monitoring scheme were set Lip across Europe in the 1980s in response to concern about air pollution-related forest dieback ( Waldsterben ) and have continued since then . Recent threat to forest health are climatic extreme likely due to global climate change and increased ground ozone level and nitrogen deposition . We model yearly data on tree crown defoliation , an indicator of tree health , from a monitoring survey carried Out in Baden-Wurttemberg , Germany since 1983 . On a changing irregular grid , defoliation and other sue-specific variable are recorded , In Baden-Wurttemberg , the temporal trend of defoliation differs among area because of site characteristic and pollution level , making it necessary to allow for space-time interaction in the model . For this purpose , we propose using generalized additive mixed model ( GAMMs ) incorporating scale-invariant tensor product smooth of the space-time dimension . The space-time smoother allows separate smoothing parameter and penalty for the space and time dimension and thus avoids the need to make arbitrary or ad hoc choice about the relative scaling of space and time . The approach of using a space-time smoother ha intuitive appeal , making it easy to explain and interpret when communicating the result to nonstaticians , such a environmental policy maker . The model incorporates a nonlinear effect for mean tree age . the most important predictor . allowing the separation of trend in time . which may be pollution-related , from trend that relate purely to the aging of the survey population . In addition to a temporal trend due to site characteristic and other condition modeled with the space-time Smooth , We account for random temporal correlation at site level by an autoregressive moving average ( ARMA ) process . Model selection is carried Out using the Bayes information criterion ( BIC ) . and the adequacy of the assumed spatial and temporal error Structure is investigated with the empirical semivariogram and the empirical autocorrelation function .

aVIf global warming is accelerating , then one might expect temperature for most station to be accelerating and perhaps variability to be increasing . In this study , we examine 57 New Zealand temperature time series for evidence of non-linearity and changing variability . These correspond to time series for annual minimum , annual mean and annual maximum for 19 station . Estimation is by an extended least-squares method . We find a surprising diversity of behaviour of these series - presumably reflecting their different geographic factor a well a series length . We give evidence of region where temperature are decreasing . For series where a linear trend is significant , it is downwards in about one third of the case . This proportion wa higher in the South Island , especially for series of minimum . Where a non-linear trend is significant , temperature are decelerating in about one half of the case . The ratio of downward to upward trend is highest among annual maximum and South Island minimum and smallest in annual mean . Where a linear trend in the variability is significant , it is decreasing in 13 case and increasing in 5 case , although possibly this is partly due to poorer quality data last century . Where a non-linear trend in the variability is significant , variability is decelerating in about two third of the case . The result are used to project upper and lower return level of minimum , mean and maximum for each of the series to the year 2010 .

aVAmphibians are declining globally at unprecedented rate . To direct conservation effort , global amphibian assessment are being conducted to characterize biodiversity and evolutionary relationship among specie , a well a amphibian population and specie ' health . Modern molecular method are facilitating such characterization , and we highlight technique for rapidly increasing the availability of data for making taxonomic distinction . When diversity is characterized , and population and the specie most vulnerable to decline or extinction are identified , it is then critical to understand factor causing decline to develop mitigation strategy . We discus molecular approach and their application for addressing some of the leading hypothesis for amphibian decline , including habitat loss , emerging infection disease , chemical contaminant , and global climate change .

aVSpecies restricted to the higher altitude of low mountain range in Central Europe are among the specie threatened . To quantify the influence of climate warming , we analysed the altitudinal distribution of mollusc specie and modelled the occurrence and distribution of a high montane specie under two scenario of climate warming . Our analysis is based on sample of 3,437 individual and 46 specie collected at 111 locality . Number of individual and specie decreased with altitude . The slope of this decrease changed between 1,100 and 1,200 m a.s.l. , which is the ecotone between mixed montane beech-fir-spruce and high-altitude spruce forest . In contrast to the majority of specie and the number of specie , the occurrence of Semilimax kotulae ( Westerlund 1883 ) , a Central European endemic , increased with altitude . Again , we found a change in the slope between 1,100 and 1,200 m a.s.l . Using geostatistical model of local temperature a well a spatial GLMs with Poisson and Gaussian error , we modelled altitudinal distribution of diversity and specie under consideration of environmental variable . Especially habitat age wa an important predictor for the abundance of many specie . For the high montane specie S. kotulae , our model predicts a decrease in occurrence and abundance with global warming . Although global warming will lead to an overall increase in number of specie , specie occurring only at higher elevation , such a the S. kotulae , will probably become extinct within the study area .

aVUsing Monte-Carlo method , the law of statistic of record-breaking high temperature event ha been investigated based on the statistical characteristic of the temperature data registered in 40 year from 1961 to 2000 in Nanjing area , and the influence on the law of statistic of the global warming ( v = 0.006 degree C/a ) during 20th century and Nanjing regional warming ( v = 0.017 degree C/a ) in last 40 year ha also been compared . Both the theoretic analysis and Monte Carlo simulation result show that the most likely probability of it occurrence intensity of the k'th record-breaking high temperature event take the form of linear increase with root k ( k = 1,2,3 , ... ) and the frequency of the occurrence of record-breaking high temperature event in a year tends to 1/ ( t + 1 ) decreasing with time t , and in year when the average temperature is high , the probability of the occurrence of record-breaking high temperature event is also high , otherwise , the probability is low . The result also indicates that the velocity of global warming ( v = 0.006 degree C/a ) in 20th century and the rate of regional warming ( v = 0.017 degree C/a ) of Nanjing area in last 40 year are yet insufficient to alter meaningfully the intensity and frequency of record high temperature event . However , such velocity of warming will ultimately make the frequency of the occurrence of record-breaking high temperature event decrease gradually towards a constant , being approximately equal to the warming velocity . In addition , we have also studied the effect of variance and autocorrelation between temperature in two successive day on record-breaking high temperature event , finding that the effect of different variance and weak autocorrelation on the intensity and probability of occurrence of the record-breaking

aVCarbon dioxide and it different compound are generated a primary greenhouse gas from the flue gas of coal-fired thermal power plant , boiler , and other stationary combustion process . This greenhouse gas cause global warming after being emitted to the environment . To deal with this problem , a new dry scrubbing process wa tested in this study . A three-stage countercurrent fluidized bed adsorber wa developed , designed , and fabricated . It wa used a a removal apparatus and operated in a continuous regime for the two-phase system . The height of each stage wa 0.30 m , and the inner diameter wa 0.10 m. The paper present the removal Of CO ( 2 ) from gas mixture by chemical sorption on porous granular calcium oxide particle in the reactor at ambient temperature . The advantage of a multistage fluidized bed reactor for high mass transfer and high gas-solid contact can enhance the removal of the gas when using a dry method . The effect of the operating parameter such a sorbent , superficial gas velocity , and the Weir height on CO ( 2 ) removal efficiency in the multistage fluidized bed were investigated . The result indicate that the removal efficiency of the carbon dioxide wa around 71 % at a high solid flow rate corresponding to lower gas velocity at room temperature . In comparison with wet scrubber , this dry process appears to have lower cost , le complicated configuration , and simpler disposal of used sorbent . The result in this study assume importance from the perspective of use of a multistage fluidized bed adsorber for control of gaseous pollutant at high temperature .

aVA multi-millennial simulation with the CSIRO Mark 2 coupled global climatic model ha been used to determine whether climatic condition approximate to those experienced by the medieval Norse settler in Greenland could be identified . The aim of this analysis wa to see whether such condition could be replicated by the natural climatic variability in this unforced simulation , in order to counteract claim that the current observed global warming is merely another example of this type of climatic regime . This view ha been expressed in the medium in an attempt to refute the existence of a CO ( 2 ) -induced global warming . A 291-year period of above-average temperature followed by a 41-year cooler period were identified in one millennium of the simulation , and subsequently used a an analogue of condition representative of the time of the Norse settlement . Considerable interannual variability existed in both these period , but with noticeable positive and negative surface temperature anomaly in the warm and cold period respectively . Thus the warm period wa not a time of uniform benign condition . Above-average precipitation wa also associated with the warm period , and these climatic condition would have enhanced pasture growth and hay production ( the only crop the Norse produced ) thereby sustaining the livelihood of the Norse Greenlanders . The climatic condition associated with the cold period in the model were probably sufficient to limit the survival prospect of the settler , especially when other , probably more critical , deleterious factor are taken into account . The temperature anomaly replicated in the simulation are similar to the limited proxy data , but may be smaller in magnitude : nevertheless they appear to be sufficiently large to have affected the viability of the Norse Greenlanders . After considering possible climatic mechanism that could have contributed to these warm and cold period it wa concluded that they are simply a consequence of stochastic influence generated by nonlinear process in the simulation . Thus this simulation provides no support for the contention that the current global warming is a manifestation of condition prevailing during the Norse settlement in Greenland .

aVInternal and externally forced variability in oceanic oxygen ( O ( 2 ) ) are investigated on different spatiotemporal scale using a six-member ensemble from the National Center for Atmospheric Research CSM1.4-carbon coupled climate model . The oceanic O ( 2 ) inventory is projected to decrease significantly in global warming simulation of the 20th and 21st century . The anthropogenically forced O ( 2 ) decrease is partly compensated by volcanic eruption , which cause considerable interannual to decadal variability . Volcanic perturbation in oceanic oxygen concentration gradually penetrate the ocean 's top 500 m and persist for several year . While well identified on global scale , the detection and attribution of local O ( 2 ) change to volcanic forcing is difficult because of unforced variability . Internal climate mode can substantially contribute to surface and subsurface O ( 2 ) variability . Variability in the North Atlantic and North Pacific are associated with change in the North Atlantic Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation index . Simulated decadal variability compare well with observed O ( 2 ) change in the North Atlantic , suggesting that the model capture key mechanism of late 20th century O ( 2 ) variability , but the model appears to underestimate variability in the North Pacific . Our result suggest that large interannual to decadal variation and limited data availability make the detection of human-induced O ( 2 ) change currently challenging .

aVSpecies in which ambient temperature directly determine offspring sex may be at particular risk a global climate change . Whether or not climate change affect sex ratio depends upon the effectiveness of buffering mechanism that link ambient regime to actual nest temperature . For example , female may simply lay nest earlier in the season , or in more shaded area , such that incubation thermal regime are unchanged despite massive ambient fluctuation . Based on eight year of monitoring nest over a 10-year period in the field at an alpine site in southeastern Australia , we show that , even though lizard ( Bassiana duperreyi , Scincidae ) have adjusted both nest depth and seasonal timing of oviposition in response to rising ambient temperature , they have been unable to compensate entirely for climate change . That inability stem from the fact that the seasonal progression of soil temperature , and thus , the degree to which thermal regime at the time of laying predict subsequent condition during incubation , also ha shifted with climate change . As a result , mean incubation temperature in natural nest now have crossed the thermal threshold at which incubation temperature directly affect offspring sex in this population .

aVAs it ha been reported by Siwiec [ 49 ] , Helms & Lambrecht [ 21 ] the global warming is defined a increase of average temperature of the Earth 's near-surface air and the ocean . There are different gas emitted responsible for this effect , mainly : water vapor , CH ( 4 ) , N ( 2 ) O and CO ( 2 ) . According to the recent knowledge , it is supposed that apart from water vapor . CO ( 2 ) can have the highest influence on global warming . Carbon dioxide emission source can be divided into two group : nature ( eruption of volcano , water evaporation , and so on ) and anthropogenic . Economic development caused that anthropogenic factor ha more share in global greenhouse gas emission . This phenomenon occurrence is connected with transport development , which can be divided into the following group : aircraft industry , automotive industry , railway transport , construction of ship , aerospace industry . EU directive concerning CO ( 2 ) emission reduction caused many applied technology to become unprofitable considering environmental preservation . Due to that , there is an urgent need of creating new or modifying existing technological solution especially in the field of material engineering resulting in further technological development , especially in such branch like automotive and aircraft industry [ 57 ] . The idea of decreasing the weight of vehicle is not a new challenge and it ha been taken up by many research group . The effect are mainly observed in reduction of vehicle body weight which directly influence the CO ( 2 ) emission decrease . However , in case of vehicle ' part subjected to wear or/and contact fatigue ( engine , gear e.g . gearbox ) the use of light weigh alloy give rise to many difficulty . A research in this field may bring another reduction of vehicle ' total weight . However , Srivastava et al . [ 50 ] hold that the use of titanium , aluminum or magnesium alloy by their nature can cause an increase of wear and lower the contact fatigue resistance . In this work , the base problem of greenhouse gas emission wa explained . Moreover , after market analysis the application of aluminum alloy in transportation wa proposed and the potential use in exposition to semi or high load and wear wa described .

aVIn a mesocosm experiment , with bare peat soil exposed to different water level ( WL ) , we examined whether heterotrophic respiration ( R ( h ) ) acclimated to a 3 degree C temperature increase . Across all WLs , R ( h ) at 15 degree C wa never lower in the heated treatment than in the unheated treatment , indicating that Rh did not acclimate to the warmer condition . We hypothesize that this lack of thermal acclimation is due to the unlimited substrate availability in these organic soil . These result imply that peat soil may exhibit a sustained positive feedback to global warming . ( C ) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVLake Qinghai , on the NE Tibetan Plateau , is China 's largest natural lake that lie at a triple junction of major climatic influence , making it sensitive to global climate change . As such , the sediment of Lake Qinghai have been the focus of numerous palaeoenvironmental study spanning a range of timescales . However , a a result of uncertain age control , uncertainty over interpretation of the proxy , the relative dearth of proxy calibration and lack of understanding of the modern lake system a coherent picture of climate over the NE Tibetan Plateau ha yet to emerge from Lake Qinghai 's sediment record . We review the state of knowledge for this important site , focusing on the last millennium . A comparison of the major proxy record show significant variability with a general pattern of change over the last 1000 year , notably those linked to the onset of the Little lee Age , but due to poor chronological constraint a detailed picture of climate change can not be established . Further , some of the proxy record produced from Lake Qinghai 's sediment are open to alternative explanation . This compound the sediment record a a palaeoenvironmental archive . To fully realise the potential of Lake Qinghai , future research must concentrate on defining a reliable old carbon effect for the lake , calibrating proxy record with climatic process and understanding spatial variability of proxy record within this large lake .

aVPurpose of review Global climate change and population explosion leading to change in natural ecosystem and travel across the continent have resulted in an increase in the transmission of parasite to human being . This review focus on recent advancement in parasitic lung infection . Recent finding Invasive parasitic disease including lung infection are increasingly being reported in patient with immunodeficiency syndrome . A recombinant kinesin-related antigen of Leishmania donovani ha been validated with El using urine sample for the diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis . Pyruvate kinase deficiency ha been shown to provide protection against Plasmodium falciparum infection . Intravenous artesunate is an alternative drug for the treatment of severe malaria . The best way to protect from malaria is the use of long-lasting insecticide-treated bednets . Biennial treatment with praziquantel ha been found to be cost-effective treatment for control of infection with Schistosoma haematobium . Pulmonary paragonimiasis can be diagnosed by fine needle aspiration biopsy of pulmonary nodule . Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfection can mimic accelerated idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis . Migratory nodular shadow with halo are important chest computed tomographic finding in human toxocariasis . Summary Patients with immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV infection , organ transplantation and immunosuppressive drug , including corticosteroid ) should be evaluated for early detection of parasitic lung infection .

aVThe population barely perceives change in vegetation that occur very quickly in subalpine region . In recent decade , large area have been invaded by woody plant , whilst demand for an open , attractive and readable landscape remains strong . The result of the modeling of vegetation dynamic carried out on the pasture of Larzey show a strong and rapid development of tree cover , accelerated by global warming , despite the maintenance of grazing pressure . This creates a loss in biodiversity a well a significant loss of attractiveness for the population . Thought should be engaged , on how maintaining landscape with high environmental , aesthetic and social value , a well a on the mean necessary to recognize and enhance landscape service provided by mountain agriculture .

aVBiologists have long been concerned with measuring thermal performance curve and limit because of their significance to fitness . Basic experimental design may have a marked effect on the outcome of such measurement , and this is true especially of the experimental rate of temperature change used during assessment of critical thermal limit to activity . To date , the focus of work ha almost exclusively been on the effect of rate variation on mean value of the critical limit . If the rate of temperature change used in an experimental trial affect not only the trait mean but also it variance , estimate of heritable variation would also be profoundly affected . Moreover , if the outcome of acclimation are likewise affected by methodological approach , assessment of beneficial acclimation and other hypothesis might also be compromised . In this article , we determined whether this is the case for critical thermal limit using a population of the model specie Drosophila melanogaster and the invasive ant specie Linepithema humile . We found that effect of the different rate of temperature change are variable among trait and specie . However , in general , different rate of temperature change resulted in different phenotypic variance and different estimate of heritability , presuming that genetic variance remains constant . We also found that different rate resulted in different conclusion regarding the response of the specie to acclimation , especially in the case of L. humile . Although it seems premature to dismiss past generality concerning interspecific and acclimation-related variation in critical thermal limit , we recommend that condition during trial be appropriately selected , carefully reported and rigorously controlled .

aVRestoration of wetland hydrology can produce ecological benefit but may have unintended consequence . We examined effect of altered water level on release of dissolved reactive phosphorus ( DRP ) and greenhouse gas ( GHG ) in soil core from a marsh being evaluated for restoration . We also measured field concentration of DRP and other constituent in wetland porewater . Intact core from a sampling location with higher Fe and lower calcium carbonate ( CaCO ( 3 ) ) content released more DRP than another location , and displayed higher DRP under completely saturated compared to partly drained condition . Porewater sample collected from the high-Fe location also contained higher DRP level . Chemical data suggest that redox-driven reaction largely controlled DRP level at the high-Fe site , while CaCO ( 3 ) adsorption wa more important at the low-Fe site . Over the long term , water table elevation may attenuate P draining from the wetland due to decreased mineralization . However , such measure may increase P release in the short term . Raising the water level in soil core resulted in decreased nitrous oxide ( N ( 2 ) O ) emission , increased methane ( CH ( 4 ) ) emission , and an overall increase in total global warming potential ( GWP ) . The proportion of total GWP contributed by N ( 2 ) O decreased from 14 % to < = 1 % a water level wa raised , while the proportion contributed by CH , increased from 10 to 20 % to 60 to 80 % . Restoration of hydrology in the Rice Lake wetland ha the potential to affect both local water quality and global air quality These combined effect complicate the cost-to-benefit analysis of such wetland restoration effort .

aVIncrease in seawater temperature is one of the major effect of global climate change that affect marine organism , including Cnidaria . Among them , gorgonian from the NW Mediterranean Sea , such a the specie Eunicella singularis , have suffered spectacular and extensive damage . We thus investigated in a controlled laboratory experiment the response of E. singularis to a long-term increase in temperature and we took a special interest in it photosynthetic and calcification response to the stress . Two population collected at 15 and 35 m depth were studied in order to determine whether there wa a difference in sensitivity to thermal stress between living depth . Our result show : ( a ) that calcification and photosynthesis were impacted only when gorgonian were maintained for more than two week at 26 degree C , and ( b ) that colony of E. singularis living in shallow water were le tolerant than those living in deep water . Because E. singularis is a symbiotic specie , we have also discussed the potential role of symbiosis in the thermotolerance response .

aVThree typical constructed wetland ( CWs ) including Vertical Flow ( VF ) , Free Water Surface ( FWS ) , and Subsurface Flow ( SF ) , and combined VF-SF-FWS constructed wetland were investigated for the treatment of domestic wastewater with low C/N ratio . The performance of nutrient removal and the characteristic of greenhouse gas emission , such a CH ( 4 ) and N ( 2 ) O , from these CWs were compared . The result indicated that the four type of CWs had high removal efficiency for organic matter and suspended solid ( SS ) . The combined wetland also showed a comparatively good performance for nitrogen and phosphorus removal , and the removal efficiency for total nitrogen ( TN ) and total phosphorus ( TP ) were 81.3 % and 84.5 % , respectively . The combined CWs had a comparative lower global warming potential . The FWS CW had the highest tendency to emit CH ( 4 ) and led to a higher global warming potential among the four type of CWs , which wa about 586 mg CO ( 2 ) /m ( 2 ) .h .

aVEggshell fragment of ratite type ( Ornitholithus , oofamily Elongatoolithidae ) -attributed to giant birds-are described from Upper Paleocene deposit in the Pyrenean-Provence region . We study the porosity of a rich Ornitholithus sample from Claret-4 locality ( Tremp Fm , Lleida , Spain ) , closely related to the global warming event which took place at the Paleocene-Eocene boundary ( PETM ) , in order to infer relation between egg conductance , nesting habit and palaeoenviromental condition . An egg mass of around 3 kg is inferred for the large Ornitholithus egg , in agreement with the value previously estimated by Touraine [ Touraine , F , 1960 . Oeufs d'Oiseaux de tres grande taille dans l'Eocene inferieur de Provence , pp . 783-789 ] , but lower than those obtained by Dughi and Sirugue ( Dughi , R. , Sirugue . F. , 1962 . Distribution verticale de oeufs d'oiseaux fosiles de l'Eocene de Basse-Provence . Bull . Soc . Geol . Fr . 7 , 69-78 ] ; O. arquatus group , 8.7 kg ) . Porosity observed in Ornitholithus eggshell is extremely reduced in comparison to bird egg and even much more reduced in relation to theropod dinosaur . Pore number is similar to that of bird egg but most Ornitholithus pore are exceedingly small ( micropores ) , thus pore radius and total pore area is much lower than in recent bird . Moreover , Ornitholithus micropores lack connectivity between them , thus decreasing functional pore area and permeability . The function of micropores could be related to weight spare , favorable hatching and/or thermal isolation . Ornitholithus eggshell are the most compact of all bird or theropod eggshell studied so far . Consequently , calculated water vapor conductance value in Ornitholithus egg are in average 8 time lower than that for recent bird . The relation between egg conductance and nesting environment shown in recent bird suggests , in the case of Ornitholithus , an open and extremely dry nest environment . Anomalous compact Ornitholithus eggshell could help to keep egg ' inner relatively-constant temperature and humidity , in the extremely warm and dry palaeoenvironment inferred for the Pyrenean region at the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum .

aVSan Francisco Bay ( SFB ) estuary sediment contain high level of mercury ( Hg ) , and tidal marsh resident specie may be vulnerable to Hg contamination . We examined Hg concentration in California black rail , a threatened waterbird specie that inhabits SFB tidal salt marsh . We captured 127 black rail during the prebreeding and postbreeding season and examined the influence of site , sex , and year on Hg , methylmercury ( MeHg ) , and also selenium ( Se ) concentration in feather and blood . Feather Hg concentration averaged 6.94 mu g/g dry weight ( dw ) and MeHg and Se concentration in blood averaged 0.38 and 0.42 mu g/g wet weight ( ww ) . We used Akaike 's information criterion model selection process to evaluate the importance of year , site , sex , and age on pattern of MeHg concentration ; sex and year were the most important of these factor . Feather Hg concentration ( dw ) were higher in male ( 8.22 mu g/g ) than female ( 6.63 mu g/g ) and higher in adult bird ( 7.36 mu g/g ) than in hatch-year bird ( 4.61 mu g/g ) . A substantial portion of SFB black rail population may be at risk of reproductive effect due to MeHg contamination , a 32-78 % of feather and < 10 % of blood sample exceeded no observed adverse effect level . Sea level rise and other anthropogenic threat to endemic tidal marsh specie such a black rail may be exacerbated by the presence of MeHg . Further study of population demographic and toxicological effect would further elucidate the effect of MeHg contamination on black rail population in SFB .

aVSedimentary basin in general , and deep saline aquifer in particular , are being investigated a possible repository for large volume of anthropogenic CO ( 2 ) that must be sequestered to mitigate global warming and related climate change . To investigate the potential for the long-term storage of CO ( 2 ) in such aquifer , 1600 t of CO ( 2 ) were injected at 1500 m depth into a 24-m-thick `` C '' sandstone unit of the Frio Formation , a regional aquifer in the US Gulf Coast . Fluid sample obtained before CO ( 2 ) injection from the injection well and an observation well 30 m updip showed a Na-Ca-Cl type brine with similar to 93,000 mg/L TDS at saturation with CH ( 4 ) at reservoir condition ; gas analysis showed that CH ( 4 ) comprised similar to 95 % of dissolved gas , but CO ( 2 ) wa low at 0.3 % . Following CO2 breakthrough . 51 h after injection , sample showed sharp drop in pH ( 6.5-5.7 ) , pronounced increase in alkalinity ( 100-3000 mg/L a HCO ( 3 ) ) and in Fe ( 30-1100 mg/L ) , a slug of very high DOC value , and significant shift in the isotopic composition of H ( 2 ) O. DIC , and CH ( 4 ) . These data , coupled with geochemical modeling , indicate corrosion of pipe and well casing a well a rapid dissolution of mineral , especially calcite and iron oxyhydroxides , both caused by lowered pH ( initially similar to 3.0 at subsurface condition ) of the brine in contact with supercritical CO ( 2 ) . These geochemical parameter , together with perfluorocarbon tracer gas ( PFTs ) , were used to monitor migration of the injected CO ( 2 ) into the overlying Frio `` B '' , composed of a 4-m-thick sandstone and separated from the `` C '' by similar to 15 m of shale and siltstone bed . Results obtained from the Frio `` B '' 6 month after injection gave chemical and isotopic marker that show significant CO ( 2 ) ( 2.9 % compared with 0.3 % CO ( 2 ) in dissolved gas ) migration into the `` B '' sandstone . Results of sample collected 15 month after injection , however , are ambiguous , and can be interpreted to show no additional injected Cot in the `` B '' sandstone . The presence of injected CO ( 2 ) may indicate migration from `` C '' to `` B '' through the intervening bed or , more likely , a short-term leakage through the remedial cement around the casing of a 50-year old well . Results obtained to date from four shallow monitoring groundwater well show no brine or CO2 leakage through the Anahuac Formation , the regional cap rock . Published by Elsevier Ltd .

aVIn this study the average monthly data anomaly of 1960 - 2007 for 740 station in China were analyzed . This research us EVT ( extreme value theory ) to explore the spatial EWME ( extreme warm month event ) property in China . The effect of potentially explanatory factor - climate warming on the distribution of EWME are investigated using GPD model with parameter estimated via a spatial scheme . The result showed that : 1 ) The property of EWME have strong spatial dependence . The EWME have smaller variability over Tibetan plateau and North China plain and the coastal area of South China , while the EWME have larger variability over North China . There are more EWME with higher quantile over Middle-lower Yangtze area than that over the other region . 2 ) The station have the return period of the 2002 EWME with 3 - 5 centigrade longer than 10 year , and some grid have the return period longer than 50 year for EWME with 5 - 7 centigrade . 3 ) It ha a potential relationship between regional climate warming and the EWME over some of special region . The variability and high quantile of the EWME are affected obviously by climate warming over Tibetan plateau plain and North China plain and northeast China plain , namely over the region between monsoon on and non-monsoons .

aVThe present study dealt with the projection of future temperature over Korea , using MM5 dynamic-downscaling simulation , for the period 1971-2100 . MM5 simulation were based on the IPCC 's ( Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ) A1B scenario , which ha been described in detail in the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios . Regional climate projection showed that the annual mean value of daily mean temperature will increase by 3.8 degree C between now and the 2071-2100 period . Comparing minimum and maximum temperature , the change in minimum temperature is expected to be larger ( 4.0 degree C ) than that in maximum temperature ( 3.5 degree C ) . Seasonally , the increase is projected to be greater in winter than in summer . Inter-annual variability is also projected to be higher in winter than in summer . In the troposphere , a rise in temperature show a tendency to be greater with height ; thus , increase are projected to reach a peak value of +4.5 degree C at 400 hPa . Frequency distribution of daily mean temperature , showing an increase in the mean value without a change in variance , will reflect a change in temperature extreme . Hot event , based on the 95th percentile of the daily maximum temperature , are expected to be intensified by 2.3 degree C and to be 5 time more frequent in the 2071-2100 period than in the 1971-2000 period , Cold event , based on the 5th percentile of daily minimum temperature , are predicted to become warmer by 5.3 degree C , and the number of day involved will be reduced by 99 % . The rise in temperature is projected to be associated with an increase in relative humidity of 2 % and specific humidity of 29 % near the surface over Korea by the end of the 21st century . The projection show consistency between temperature and humidity change , at a rate of about 7 % K ( -1 ) of the Moisture holding capacity .

aVThe global warming intensity of crop-based biofuels and fossil fuel differ not only in amount but also in their discharge pattern over time . Early discharge , for example , from market-mediated land use change , will have created more global warming by any time in the future than later discharge , owing to the slow decay of atmospheric CO ( 2 ) . A spreadsheet model of this process , BTIME , capture this important time pattern effect using the Bern CO ( 2 ) decay model to allow fuel to be compared for policy decision on the basis of their real warming effect with a variety of user-supplied parameter value . The model also allows economic discounting of climate effect extended far into the future . Compared to approach that simply sum greenhouse gas emission over time , recognizing the physic of atmospheric CO ( 2 ) decay significantly increase the deficit relative to fossil fuel of any biofuel causing land use change .

aVSoil organic carbon ( SOC ) is an important indicator of soil quality and productivity . The present study focus on the comparative evaluation of the 'wet digestion ' and 'oxidative combustion-infrared analysis ' method for determination of SOC with example from part of the Himalayan and Central Indian soil . It is found that the commonly used wet digestion ( Walkley and Black ) method underestimate the SOC significantly . The study estimate a correction factor quite different from the standard adopted in most of the investigation . Considering the importance of SOC stock and dynamic being used a input in model predicting global climate change and future global carbon cycle , it is emphasized that appropriate correction factor need to be developed for Indian soil , and applied to the SOC estimate obtained from the Walkley and Black method to improve the accuracy .

aVThe increase in carbon dioxide ( CO ( 2 ) ) emission to the atmosphere from different country ha given rise to one of the most serious environmental problem of our time : global warming . Countries and living organism are both complex system in that they use environmental resource to support their own dynamic . Guided by the hypothesis that the behaviour of country might obey quantifiable universal law that capture the essential feature of other complex living system , we analysed the CO ( 2 ) emission of different country based on the classical scaling law of living organism . Based on these law , we estimated the CO ( 2 ) emission to the atmosphere of 13 country in term of each country 's body mass . A comparison with empirical data for 2002 suggests that very few country follow the scaling law . Countries have a body ( structure in space ) , but also a rhythm ( structure in time ) . Based on the idea of similarity between living organism and country , optimal feature of intermittent flow ( rhythmicity ) for country are equally presented .

aVForests help mitigate climate change by sequestering atmospheric carbon . However , boreal and high-latitude temperate forest may also contribute to global warming due to the albedo effect . The relative effect of carbon sequestration and albedo can be quantified in term of radiative forcing . We present a stylized , stand-level analysis to determine the optimal rotation age when considering a tax/subsidy scheme based on radiative forcing and the notion of equivalent carbon emission . Additional management decision variable considered include specie choice and regeneration effort , since these can impact the albedo effect . We demonstrate analytically that the optimal rotation length is likely shortened when albedo-related equivalent emission are incorporated , relative to a policy based only on carbon . Empirical result indicate that rotation age do decrease relative to a `` carbon only '' policy , and approach the traditional ( timber only ) Faustmann rotation age a equivalent emission rate increase . Our result suggest that forestation doe not necessarily provide climatic benefit in all circumstance , and that . at the margin , other opportunity for carbon reduction ( e.g . abatement ) , or pursuing forestation in other location , become more attractive .

aVHousehold fuel use in developing country , particularly a biomass and coal , is a major source of carbonaceous aerosol and other air pollutant affecting health and climate . Using state-of-the-art emission inventory , a global three-dimensional photochemical tracer/transport model of the troposphere , and a global radiative transfer model based on method presented in the latest IPCC Assessment Report ( 2007-AR4 ) , we estimate the radiative forcing ( RF ) attributable to household fuel combustion in Asia in term of current global annual-mean RF and future global integrated RF for a one-year pulse of emission ( 2000 ) over two time horizon ( 100 and 20 year ) . Despite the significant emission of black carbon ( BC ) aerosol , these estimate indicate that shorter-lived ( non-Kyoto ) air pollutant from household fuel use in the region overall seem to exert a small net negative RF because of the strong influence of reflective aerosol . There are , however , major uncertainty in emission estimate for solid fuel burning , and about the sustainability of household fuel wood harvesting in Asia ( the carbon neutrality of harvesting ) . In addition , there is still substantial uncertainty associated with the BC radiative forcing . As a result we find that the sign of the RF from household biomass burning in the region can not be established . While recognizing the value of integrating climate change and air pollution policy , we are concerned that for a 'Kyoto style ' post-Kyoto treaty ( with global cap-and-trade and the Global Warming Potential a the metric ) expanding the basket of component with a selection of short-lived specie without also including the wider range of co-emitted specie may lead to unintended consequence for global-scale climate . Additional measurement , modelling , and policy research is urgently needed to reduce the uncertainty so that the net impact on climate of emission and mitigation measure in this sector can be accurately assessed .

aVWidespread evidence of a +4-6-m sea-level highstand during the last interglacial period ( Marine Isotope Stage 5e ) ha led to warning that modern ice sheet will deteriorate owing to global warming and initiate a rise of similar magnitude by AD 2100 ( ref . 1 ) . The rate of this projected rise is based on ice-sheet melting simulation and downplays discovery of more rapid ice loss ( 2,3 ) . Knowing the rate at which sea level reached it highstand during the last interglacial period is fundamental in assessing if such rapid ice-loss process could lead to future catastrophic sea-level rise . The best direct record of sea level during this highstand come from well-dated fossil reef in stable area ( 4-6 ) . However , this record lack both reef-crest development up to the full highstand elevation , a inferred ( 7 ) from widespread intertidal indicator at +6m , and a detailed chronology , owing to the difficulty of replicating U-series age on submillennial timescales ( 8 ) . Here we present a complete reef-crest sequence for the last interglacial highstand and it U-series chronology from the stable northeast Yucatan peninsula , Mexico . We find that reef development during the highstand wa punctuated by reef-crest demise at +3m and back-stepping to +6m . The abrupt demise of the lower-reef crest , but continuous accretion between the lower-lagoonal unit and the upper-reef crest , allows u to infer that this back-stepping occurred on an ecological timescale and wa triggered by a 2-3-m jump in sea level . Using strictly reliable ( 230 ) Th age of coral from the upper-reef crest , and improved stratigraphic screening of coral age from other stable site , we constrain this jump to have occurred similar to 121 kyr ago and conclude that it support an episode of ice-sheet instability during the terminal phase of the last interglacial period .

aVIn and region , mountain fulfill important ecological and economic function for the surrounding lowland . In the scenario of global warming , mountain ecosystem change rapidly , especially in the and region of northwestern China . This paper provides an assessment of the change in temperature and precipitation in the historical record of climate on the northern slope of the eastern Tianshan Mountains . A Mann-Kendall nonparametric trend and Sen 's test are employed to analyze the interannual change and innerannual variability in temperature and precipitation in the region of low to high altitude . The present study find that the largest increase in annual temperature are observed at station in the low altitude region . The significant increasing trend in temperature tend to occur mainly in late winter and early spring at station from middle to high altitude , but in summer and autumn at station of low altitude . The increasing trend in annual precipitation are found from the middle to high altitude area , but decreasing trend are found in the low altitude area . The significant increasing trend in precipitation occur mostly in winter and earlier spring at station from the middle to high altitude , while the increasing and decreasing trend coexists at station of low altitude with most of the significant trend change occurring in March , June and August .

aVIs the recent high frequency of positive Indian Ocean Dipole ( pIOD ) event a consequence of global warming ? Using available observation and reanalyses , we show that the pIOD occurrence increase from about four per 30 year early in the 20th century to about 10 over the last 30 year ; by contrast , the number of negative Indian Ocean Dipole ( nIOD ) event decrease from about 10 to two over the same period , respectively . A skewness measure , defined a the difference in occurrence of pIODs and nIODs , illustrates a systematic trend in this parameter commencing early in the 20th century . After 1950 , there are more pIODs than nIODs , with consistent mean circulation change in the pIOD-prevalent season . Over southeastern Australia ( SEA ) , these change potentially account for much of the observed austral winter and spring rainfall reduction since 1950 . These feature are consistent with projected future climate change and hence with what is expected from global warming . Citation : Cai , W. , T. Cowan , and A.

aVThe interplay between temperature-related process and predation in determining age-1 recruitment strength between 1992 and 2006 wa analysed for North Sea cod ( Gadus morhua ) and Norway pout ( Trisopterus esmarkii ) . For this purpose , an predation impact index ( PI ) wa calculated out of survey data . PI wa assumed to depend on the abundance of the predator and on the spatial overlap between predator and prey population . Generalized additive model ( GAMs ) were created with spawning stock biomass ( SSB ) and sea surface temperature ( SST ) in the respective spawning and nursery area and PI a explaining variable . SSB had no significant impact on recruitment during this time period for both specie . SSTs during spring and PI explained the interannual variability in recruitment strength to a large extent ( 88 % of the total variance for cod and 68 % for Norway pout ) . The SST during spring determined the overall level of recruitment . At SSTs above a certain level , however , the effect on recruitment wa no longer significant . In these temperature range , predation wa the dominant effect . Therefore , the fate of North Sea cod and Norway pout stock under global-warming condition will be strongly influenced by the status of the North Sea food web .

aVGreenhouse gas ( GHG ) emission related to recycling of metal in post-consumer waste are assessed from a waste management perspective ; here the material recovery facility ( MRF ) , for the sorting of the recovered metal . The GHG accounting includes indirect upstream emission , direct activity at the MRF a well a indirect downstream activity in term of reprocessing of the metal scrap and saving in term of avoided production of virgin metal . The global warming factor ( GWF ) show that upstream activity and the MRF cause negligible GHG emission ( 12.8 to 52.6 kg CO ( 2 ) -equivalents tonne ( -1 ) recovered metal ) compared to the reprocessing of the metal itself ( 360-1260 kg CO ( 2 ) -equivalents tonne ( -1 ) of recovered aluminium and 400 1020 kg CO ( 2 ) -equivalents tonne ( -1 ) of recovered steel ) . The reprocessing is however counterbalanced by large saving of avoided virgin production of steel and aluminium . The net downstream saving were found to be 5040-19 340 kg CO ( 2 ) -equivalents tonne ( -1 ) of treated aluminium and 560-2360 kg CO ( 2 ) -equivalents tonne ( -1 ) of treated steel . Due to the huge difference in reported data it is hard to compare general data on the recovery of metal scrap a they are very dependent on the technology and data choice . Furthermore , the energy used in both the recovery process a well a the avoided primary production is crucial . The range of avoided impact show that recovery of metal will always be beneficial over primary production , due to the high energy saving , and that the GHG emission associated with the sorting of metal are negligible .

aVBackground : The dinoflagellate genus Symbiodinium form symbioses with numerous protistan and invertebrate metazoan host . However , few data on symbiont genetic structure are available , hindering prediction of how these population and their host association will fair in the face of global climate change . Methodology/Principal Findings : Here , Symbiodinium population structure from two of the Caribbean 's ecologically dominant scleractinian coral , Montastraea faveolata and M. annularis , wa examined . Tagged colony on Florida Keys and Bahamian ( i.e. , Exuma Cays ) reef were sampled from 2003 -2005 and their Symbiodinium diversity assessed via internal transcribed spacer 2 ( ITS2 ) rDNA and three Symbiodinium Clade B-specific microsatellite locus . Generally , the majority of host individual at a site harbored an identical Symbiodinium ITS2 `` type '' B1 microsatellite genotype . Notably , symbiont genotype were largely reef endemic , suggesting a near absence of dispersal between population . Relative to the Bahamas , sympatric M. faveolata and M. annularis in the Florida Keys harbored unique Symbiodinium population , implying regional host specificity in these relationship . Furthermore , within-colony Symbiodinium population structure remained stable through time and environmental perturbation , including a prolonged bleaching event in 2005 . Conclusions/Significance : Taken together , the population-level endemism , specificity and stability exhibited by Symbiodinium raise concern about the long-term adaptive capacity and persistence of these symbioses in an uncertain future of climate change .

aVSeed bank density respond to factor across local to landscape scale , and therefore , knowledge of these response may be necessary in forecasting the effect of climate change on the regeneration of specie . This study relates the seed bank density of specie of Taxodium distichum swamp to local water regime and regional climate factor at five latitude across the Mississippi River Alluvial Valley from southern Illinois to Louisiana . In an outdoor nursery setting , the seed bank of twenty-five swamp were exposed to non-flooded ( freely drained ) or flooded treatment , and the number and specie of seed germinating were recorded from each swamp during one growing season . Based on ANOVA analysis , the majority of dominant specie had a higher rate of germination in non-flooded versus flooded treatment . Similarly , an NMS comparison , which considered the local water regime and regional climate of the swamp , found that the specie of seed germinating , almost completely shifted under non-flooded versus flooded treatment . For example , in wetter northern swamp , seed of Taxodium distichum germinated in non-flooded condition , but did not germinate from the same seed bank in flooded condition . In wetter southern swamp , seed of Eleocharis cellulosa germinated in flooded condition , but did not germinate in non-flooded condition . The strong relationship of seed germination and density relationship with local water regime and regional climate variable suggests that the forecasting of climate change effect on swamp and other wetland need to consider a variety of interrelated variable to make adequate projection of the regeneration response of specie to climate change . Because regeneration is an important aspect of specie maintenance and restoration , climate drying could influence the specie distribution of these swamp in the future .

aVThe regional climate change index ( RCCI ) is employed to investigate hot-spots under 21st century global warming over East Asia . The RCCI is calculated on a 1-degree resolution grid from the ensemble of CMIP3 simulation for the B1 , A1B , and A2 IPCC emission scenario . The RCCI over East Asia exhibit marked sub-regional variability . Five sub-regional hot-spots are identified over the area of investigation : three in the northern region ( Northeast China , Mongolia , and Northwest China ) , one in eastern China , and one over the Tibetan Plateau . Contributions from different factor to the RCCI are discussed for the sub-regions . Analysis of the temporal evolution of the hot-spots throughout the 21st century show different speed of response time to global warming for the different sub-regions . Hot-spots firstly emerge in Northwest China and Mongolia . The Northeast China hot-spot becomes evident by the mid of the 21st century and it is the most prominent by the end of the century . While hot-spots are generally evident in all the 5 sub-regions for the A1B and A2 scenario , only the Tibetan Plateau and Northwest China hot-spots emerge in the B1 scenario , which ha the lowest greenhouse gas ( GHG ) concentration . Our analysis indicates that subregional hot-spots show a rather complex spatial and temporal dependency on the GHG concentration and on the different factor contributing to the RCCI .

aVIn the Low Arctic , a warming climate is increasing rate of permafrost degradation and altering vegetation . Disturbance associated with warming permafrost can change microclimate and expose area of ion-rich mineral substrate for colonization by plant . Consequently , the response of vegetation to warming air temperature may differ significantly from disturbed to undisturbed tundra . Across a latitudinal air temperature gradient , we tested the hypothesis that the microenvironment in thaw slump would be warmer and more nutrient rich than undisturbed tundra , resulting in altered plant community composition and increased green alder ( Alnus viridis subsp . fruticosa ) growth and reproduction . Our result show increased nutrient availability , soil pH , snow pack , ground temperature , and active layer thickness in disturbed terrain and suggest that these variable are important driver of plant community structure . We also found increased productivity , catkin production , and seed viability of green alder at disturbed site . Altered community composition and enhancement of alder growth and reproduction show that disturbance exert a strong influence on deciduous shrub that make slump potential seed source for undisturbed tundra . Overall , these result indicate that accelerated disturbance regime have the potential to magnify the effect of warming temperature on vegetation . Consequently , understanding the relative effect of temperature and disturbance on Arctic plant community is critical to predicting feedback between northern ecosystem and global climate change .

aVFood production and consumption cause significant environmental burden during the product life cycle . As a result of intensive development and the changing social attitude and behavior in the last century , the agrofood sector is the highest resource consumer after housing in the EU . This paper is part of an effort to estimate environmental impact associated with life cycle of the agrofood chain , such a primary energy consumption , water exploitation , and global warming . Life cycle assessment is used to investigate the production of the following citrus-based product in Italy : essential oil , natural juice , and concentrated juice from orange and lemon . The related process flowchart , the relevant mass and energy flow , and the key environmental issue are identified for each product . This paper represents one of the first study on the environmental impact from cradle to gate for citrus product in order to suggest feasible strategy and action to improve their environmental performance .

aVTree-ring width and age structure of Juniperus przewalskii ( Qilian juniper ) forest were analyzed for four tree-line site in Qilian and Anyemaqen Mountains , northeastern Tibetan Plateau , to investigate their relationship to climate change . Tree-line growth on Qilian Mountain wa mainly limited by temperature at the low-frequency band . However , tree-line growth in the Anyemaqen Mountain wa highly correlated with the current growing season temperature at the high-frequency band , and with the previous growing season precipitation at the low-frequency band . A temperature-stressed growth pattern at colder western site and a moisture-stressed growth pattern at the warm , drier eastern tree-line site were detected . The number of surviving tree in the tree-line ecotone wa not clearly correlated with temperature before the 1900s . An unprecedented rise in the number of tree coincided well with the rapid global warming after the 1900s .

aVRecent diagnostics with the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Climate Model , version 2.1 ( GFDL CM2.1 ) , coupled model 's twentieth-century simulation reveal that this particular model demonstrates skill in capturing the mean and variability associated with the South Asian summer monsoon precipitation . Motivated by this , the author examine the future projection of the mean monsoon and synoptic system in this model 's simulation in which quadrupling of CO ( 2 ) concentration are imposed . In a warmer climate , despite a weakened cross-equatorial flow , the time-mean precipitation over peninsular part of India increase by about 10 % -15 % . This paradox is interpreted a follows : the increased precipitation over the equatorial western Pacific force an anomalous descending circulation over the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean , the two region being connected by an overturning mass circulation . The spatially well-organized anomalous precipitation over the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean force twin anticyclone a a Rossby wave response in the lower troposphere . The southern component of the anticyclone opposes and weakens the climatological cross-equatorial monsoon flow . The patch of easterly anomaly centered in the southern Arabian Sea is expected to deepen the thermocline north of the equator . Both these factor limit the coastal upwelling along Somalia , resulting in local sea surface warming and eventually leading to a local maximum in evaporation over the southern Arabian Sea . It is shown that change in SST are predominantly responsible for the increase in evaporation over the southern Arabian Sea . The diagnostics suggest that in addition to the increased CO ( 2 ) -induced rise in temperature , evaporation , and atmospheric moisture , local circulation change in the monsoon region further increase SST , evaporation , and atmospheric moisture , leading to increased rainfall over peninsular part of India . This result implies that accurate observation of SST and surface flux over the Indian Ocean is of urgent need to understand and monitor the response of the monsoon in a warming climate . To understand the regional feature of the rainfall change , the International Pacific Research Center ( IPRC ) Regional Climate Model ( RegCM ) , with three different resolution setting ( 0.5 degree X 0.5 degree , 0.7 degree X 0.75 degree , and 1.0 degree X 1.0 degree ) , wa integrated for 20 yr , with lateral and lower boundary condition taken from the GFDL model . The RegCM solution confirm the major result obtained from the GFDL model but also capture the orographic nature of monsoon precipitation and regional circulation change more realistically . The hypothesis that in a warmer climate , an increase in troposphere moisture content favor more intense monsoon depression is tested . The GFDL model doe not reveal any change , but solution from the RegCM suggest a statistically significant increase in the number of storm that have wind speed of 15-20 m s ( -1 ) or greater , depending on the resolution employed . Based on these regional model solution a possible implication is that in a CO ( 2 ) -richer climate an increase in the number of flood day over central India can be expected . The model result obtained here , though plausible , need to be taken with caution since even in this `` best '' model systematic error still exist in simulating some aspect of the tropical and monsoon climate .

aVLake Huron ha a rich aquatic habitat diversity that includes shallow embayment , numerous tributary , shallow mid-lake reef complex , archipelago , and profundal region . These habitat provide support for warm , cool , and cold water fish community . Diversity of fish in Lake Huron reflects post-glaciation colonization event , current climate condition , accidental and intentional introduction of non-indigenous specie , and extinction . Most extinction event have been largely associated with habitat alteration , exploitation of fishery , and interaction with non-indigenous specie . The most recent historical survey of extirpated and imperiled specie conducted in the late 1970s identified 79 fish specie in Lake Huron proper and about 50 additional specie in tributary . Of those 129 specie , 20 are now considered extirpated or imperiled . Extirpated specie include Arctic grayling , paddlefish , weed shiner , deepwater cisco , blackfin cisco , shortnose cisco , and kiyi . Six specie have declined appreciably due to loss of clear-water stream habitat : the river redhorse , river darter , black redhorse , pugnose shiner , lake chubsucker , redside dace , eastern sand darter , and channel darter . While numerous agency , university , and other organization routinely monitor nearshore and offshore fish distribution and abundance , there is a need for more rigorous examination of the distribution and abundance of less-common specie to better understand their ecology . This information is critical to the development of management plan aimed at ecosystem remediation and restoration .

aVThe thermocline depth is defined a the depth of the maximum vertical temperature gradient . In the equatorial Pacific , the depth of 20 degree C isotherm is widely used to represent the thermocline depth . This work proposes that under the circumstance of a significant mean climate shift , it is better to use the original definition of the thermocline depth in studying the long-term change in mean climate and tropical coupled climate variability . For instance , during the transient period of global warming , the tropical thermocline is usually enhanced because the surface layer warms more and faster than the lower layer . The depth of maximum vertical temperature gradient shoal , which is consistent with the enhanced thermocline . However , the 20 degree C isotherm depth deepens , which suggests a weakened thermocline . This discrepancy exists in both the observation and the future climate simulation of coupled model .

aVIn the context of global warming , the general trend towards earlier flowering date of many temperate tree specie is likely to result in an increased risk of damage from exposure to frost . To test this hypothesis , a phenological model of apple flowering wa applied to a temperature series from two location in an important area for apple production in Europe ( Trentino , Italy ) . Two simulated 50-year climatic projection ( A2 and B2 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - Special Report on Emission Scenarios ) from the HadCM3 general circulation model were statistically downscaled to the two site . Hourly temperature record over a 40-year period were used a the reference for past climate . In the phenological model , the heat requirement ( degree hour ) for flowering wa parameterized using two approach ; static ( constant over time ) and dynamic ( climate dependent ) . Parameterisation took into account the tree ' adaptation to changing temperature based on either past instrumental record or the downscaled output from the climatic simulation . Flowering date for the past 40 year and simulated flowering date for the next 50 year were used in the model . A significant trend towards earlier flowering wa clearly detected in the past . This negative trend wa also apparent in the simulated data . However , the significance wa le apparent when the `` dynamic '' setting for the degree hour requirement wa used in the model . The number of frost episode and flowering date , on an annual basis , were graphed to ass the risk of spring frost . Risk analysis confirmed a lower risk of exposure to frost at present than in the past , and probably either constant or a slightly lower risk in future , especially given that physiological process are expected to acclimate to higher temperature .

aVRadon is being measured continuously in spring water and soil-gas at Badshahi Thaul Campus , Tehri Garhwal in Himalayan region by using radon Emanometer since December 2002 . An effort wa made to correlate the variance of radon concentration in spring water and soil-gas with meteorological parameter at the same location . The main meteorological parameter that affect the radon emanation from host material is surrounding temperature , barometric pressure , wind velocity , rain fall and water level of the spring . The correlation coefficient between radon concentration in spring water and different atmospheric parameter wa computed . The correlation coefficient between radon concentration in spring water and the maximum atmospheric temperature wa 0.3 , while it wa 0.4 for minimum atmospheric temperature at the monitoring site . The correlation coefficient for radon concentration in spring water with minimum and maximum relative humidity wa 0.4 . Spring water radon concentration wa found positively correlated ( 0.6 ) with water discharge rate of the spring . A weak correlation ( 0.09 ) wa observed between the radon concentration in spring water and rain fall during the measurement period . As temperature of near surface soil increase , the radon emanation coefficient from the soil surface also increase . The possible effect due to global warming and other climatic change on environment radiation level were also discussed in detail .

aVThe IPCC AR4 global warming climate simulation reveal a pronounced seasonality of polar warming amplification with maximum warming amplification in winter and minimum in summer . In this paper , we study the relative importance of surface albedo feedback ( SAF ) , change in cloud radiative forcing ( CRF ) , change in surface sensible and latent heat flux , change in heat storage , and change in the clear-sky downward infrared radiation in causing the strong seasonality of polar warming amplification by calculating partial temperature change due to each of these process using the surface energy budget equation . The main thermodynamic factor for a small polar warming amplification in summer is that the positive SAF is largely cancelled out by the negative surface CRF feedback in summer . The positive SAF is relatively much weaker in winter compared to it amplitude in summer , therefore doe not contribute to the pronounced polar warming amplification in winter . The seasonal cycle of polar surface warming amplification , in term of both spatial pattern and temporal amplitude , closely follows the seasonal cycle of the warming due to change in clear-sky downward longwave radiation alone , indicating the importance of the atmospheric process , such a water vapor feedback and dynamical feedback associated with the enhancement of poleward moist static energy transport , in causing the pronounced seasonality of polar warming amplification .

aVUsing CRU high resolution grid observational temperature and ERA40 reanalysis surface air temperature data during 1960-1999 , we investigated the sensitivity of surface air temperature change to land use/cover type in China by subtracting the reanalysis from the observed surface air temperature ( observation minus reanalysis , OMR ) . The result show that there is a stable and systemic impact of land use/cover type on surface air temperature . The surface warming of each land use/cover type reacted differently to global warming . The OMR trend of unused land ( a ( c ) 3/40.17 A degree C/decade ) , mainly comprised by sandy land , Gobi and bare rock gravel land , are obviously larger than those of the other land use/cover type . The OMR over grassland , farmland and construction land show a moderate decadal warmingabout 0.12A degree C/decade , 0.10A degree C/decade , 0.12A degree C/decade , respectively . Woodland area do not show a significant warming trend ( 0.06A degree C/decade ) . The overall assessment indicates that the surface warming is larger for area that are barren and anthropogenically developed . The better the vegetation cover , the smaller the OMR warming trend . Responses of surface air temperature to land use/cover type with similar physical and chemical property and biological process have no significant difference . The surface air temperature would not react significantly until the intensity of land cover change reach a certain degree . Within the same land use/cover type , area in eastern China with intensive human activity exhibit larger warming trend . The result provide observational evidence for modeling research on the impact of land use/cover change on regional climate . Thus , projecting further surface climate of China in regional scale should not only take greenhouse gas increase into account , but also consider the impact of land use/cover type and land cover change .

aVIntraspecific latitudinal cline in the body size of terrestrial vertebrate , where member of the same specie are larger at higher latitude , are widely interpreted a evidence for natural selection and adaptation to local climate . These cline are predicted to shift in response to climate change . We used museum specimen to measure change in the body size of eight passerine bird specie from south-eastern Australia over approximately the last 100 year . Four specie showed significant decrease in body size ( 1.8-3.6 % of wing length ) and a shift in latitudinal cline over that period , and a meta-analysis demonstrated a consistent trend across all eight specie . Southern high-latitude population now display the body size typical of more northern population pre-1950 , equivalent to a 78 shift in latitude . Using ptilochronology , we found no evidence that these morphological change were a plastic response to change in nutrition , a likely non-genetic mechanism for the pattern observed . Our result demonstrate a generalized response by eight avian specie to some major environmental change over the last 100 year or so , probably global warming .

aVCO ( 2 ) is a promising alternative to hazardous , ozone-depleting and global-warming refrigerant . It is more suitable to the ejector refrigeration cycle than to the vapor compression cycle . However , shock wave significantly reduce the efficiency of the ejector nozzle and , therefore , they must be investigated to improve the efficiency of the nozzle and the ejector and the coefficient of performance of the ejector refrigeration cycle . This paper elucidates the type of shock wave in two-phase flow Of CO ( 2 ) in converging-diverging nozzle and their relationship to inlet condition and two-phase thermodynamic state . Shock wave in supersonic liquid-vapor flow with low and medium quality through the diverging section of the nozzle were investigated . Strong- and thin-equilibrium shock wave were calculated and considered a the ideal limiting case of actual shock wave . Pseudo-shock wave and dispersed shock wave were obtained from the experiment . Both were weaker than the equilibrium shock wave and indicated relaxation phenomenon . Based on a theoretical model , the pseudo-shock wave had long relaxation time . The large liquid droplet formed could not be easily decelerated by the vapor . Conversely , the dispersed shock wave had short relaxation time . The small liquid droplet formed could be easily decelerated by the vapor , but the deceleration wa le rapid than that in the equilibrium shock wave .

aVAs a sector , agriculture is reported to be the second greatest contributor to atmospheric methane ( CH ( 4 ) ) in the U.S. , emitting 31 % of the total emission . Primary source of CH ( 4 ) on dairy farm are the animal and manure storage , with smaller contribution front field-applied manure , feces deposited by grazing animal , and manure on . barn floor . The Integrated Farm System Model ( IFSM ) wa expanded to include simulation of CH ( 4 ) emission from all farm source along with module predicting other greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emission . The new CH ( 4 ) module incorporated previously published relationship and experimental data that were consistent with our modeling objective and the current structure of IFSM . When used to simulate previously reported experiment , the model wa found to predict enteric fermentation and slurry manure storage emission similar to those measured . In simulating a representative 100-cow dairy farm in Pennsylvania , the model predicted a total average annual emission of 21 Mg CH ( 4 ) . This included annual emission of 142 kg CH ( 4 ) per cow from the Holstein herd and 6.4 kg CH ( 4 ) per m ( 3 ) of slurry manure in storage , which were consistent with previously summarized emission data . To illustrate the use of the expanded whole farm model , potential CH ( 4 ) reduction strategy were evaluated . Farm simulation showed that increasing the production and use of forage ( corn silage ) in animal diet increased CH ( 4 ) emission by 16 % with little impact on the global warming potential of the net farm emission of all GHGs . Use of grazing along with high forage diet reduced net farm GHG emission by 16 % . Using an enclosed manure storage and burning the captured biogas reduced farm emission of CH ( 4 ) by 32 % with a 24 % reduction in the net farm emission of GHG . Incorporation of GHG emission module in IFSM provides a tool for estimating whole farm emission of CH ( 4 ) and evaluating proposed reduction strategy along with their impact on net GHG emission and other environmental and economic measure .

aVThe paper present the result of simulation experiment conducted for the assessment of likely change in the cyclogenesis pattern in the Bay of Bengal ( BOB ) and the Arabian Sea ( AS ) resulting from global climate change . Two experiment were performed , namely the 'control ' ( CTL ) experiment in which the greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere wa fixed a per 1990 level and the 'greenhouse gas ' ( GHG ) experiment in which an annual compound increase of 1 % from 1990 onwards wa introduced . CTL and GHG experiment of 20 year length were performed for the period 2041-2060 . The model used is the regional climate model Had RM2 of the Hadley Centre of Climate Prediction and Research , U.K . The result have brought out some significant change in the cyclogenesis pattern in the North Indian Ocean ( BOB and AS ) . The most significant likely change is the increase in the frequency of post-monsoon storm in the Bay of Bengal . The experiment show an increase of about 50 % in the post-monsoonal cyclogenesis by 2041-2060 a a result of increased greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere . The frequency of monsoon depression / storm in the BOB is likely to decrease considerably during June-August . Due to varying impact in different season , the annual frequency of cyclonic disturbance may change marginally in the BOB . In the Arabian Sea , however the model ha simulated a significant reduction in the frequency which may be halved by the period 2041-2060 . The result show intensification of storm during May-June and September-November . The monsoon depression during July-August are likely to become le intense . In GHG experiment most of the post-monsoon storm have a tendency to strike north Andhra-Orissa coast whereas in CTL experiment the storm strike coast from Tamilnadu to south Orissa . Thus , the focus of post-monsoon storm in the BOB is likely to shift northward from Tamilnadu-Andhra Pradesh coast to north Andhra Pradesh-south Orissa coast . Another important simulated change in storm track is that more number of pre-monsoon storm in the BOB may have a tendency to recurve north or northeastward by 2041-2060 .

aVAlpine snowbeds are characterized by a long-lasting snow cover and low soil temperature during the growing season . Both these key abiotic factor controlling plant life in snowbeds are sensitive to anthropogenic climate change and will alter the environmental condition in snowbeds to a considerable extent until the end of this century . In order to name winner and loser of climate change among the plant specie inhabiting snowbeds , we analyzed the small-scale specie distribution along the snowmelt and soil temperature gradient within alpine snowbeds in the Swiss Alps . The result show that the date of snowmelt and soil temperature were relevant abiotic factor for small-scale vegetation pattern within alpine snowbed community . Species richness in snowbeds wa reduced to about 50 % along the environmental gradient towards later snowmelt date or lower daily maximum temperature . Furthermore , the occurrence pattern of the specie along the snowmelt gradient allowed the establishment of five specie category with different prediction of their distribution in a warmer world . The dominant increased their relative cover with later snowmelt date and will , therefore , lose abundance due to climate change , but resist complete disappearance from the snowbeds . The indifferents and the transient increased in specie number and relative cover with higher temperature and will profit from climate warming . The snowbed specialist will be the most suffering specie due to the loss of their habitat a a consequence of earlier snowmelt date in the future and will be replaced by the avoiders of late-snowmelt site . These forthcoming profiteer will take advantage from an increasing number of suitable habitat due to an earlier start of the growing season and increased temperature . Therefore , the characteristic snowbed vegetation will change to a vegetation unit dominated by alpine grassland specie . The study highlight the vulnerability of the established snowbed vegetation to climate change and requires further study particularly about the role of biotic interaction in the predicted invasion and replacement process .

aVSoil carbon change upon secondary succession in Imperata grassland are important both for their effect on potential production and for possible implication of forest degradation and regeneration on global climate change . We studied the effect of forest regeneration after fire in Imperata ( speargrass ) grassland of East Kalimantan on soil property , using 47 plot that last burned in 2004 . 94 plot that last burned in 2003,126 plot last burned before 2003 , 43 plot of secondary forest , and 28 plot of primary forest . Although soil carbon stock increase upon natural regeneration from grassland to secondary forest , highest carbon stock are found in the later regeneration phase and lowest under primary forest . This is contrary to the situation in other forest system . Low C stock under primary forest may be due to extremely low fertility , combined with shallow soil and low root mass in the topsoil . Root density-as observed in the field-is much higher under the grass vegetation . The effect of regeneration on soil are strongest in the A-horizon , where soil carbon content increase with 14 % , from 14.5 g kg ( -1 ) in Imperata grassland to 16.5 g kg ( -1 ) in secondary forest , while carbon stock in the A-horizon increase from 16.51 ton C ha ( -1 ) to 18.70 ton C ha ( -1 ) . This is accompanied by a decrease in pH and an increase in bulk density . The total soil carbon stock in Kalimantan ( fixed mass , approximate depth section 40 cm ) are 36.19 ton ha ( -1 ) in Imperata grassland , 38.98 ton ha ( -1 ) in secondary forest and 33.19 ton ha ( -1 ) in primary forest , which is considerably lower than in Sumatra . Above-ground C/below-ground C ratio are higher in Kalimantan primary forest but lower in Kalimantan secondary forest than in Sumatra . Soil carbon stock in Imperata grassland could be lower than previously thought . This ha important consequence for carbon sequestration project in East Kalimantan , because carbon storage potential could be higher . ( c ) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All right reserved .

aVForested mineral soil wetland ( FMSW ) store large stock of soil organic carbon ( SOC ) , but little is known on : ( i ) whether the quality of SOC stored in these soil ( proportion of active versus more resistant SOC compound ) differs from SOC in upland soil ; ( ii ) how the quality of SOC in FMSW varies with mean annual temperature ( MAT ) ; and ( iii ) whether SOC decomposition rate in these environment respond to warming and drying more strongly than those observed in upland soil . To address this substantial knowledge gap , we identified nine FMSW and fifteen paired upland forest site across three bioregions in North America ( sub-alpine in Colorado ; north-temperate in Minnesota ; and south-temperate in South Carolina ) to test the following three hypothesis . First , FMSW store a higher proportion of active SOC compared with upland system because long anaerobic period favor the accumulation of labile substrate . Second , in FMSW , SOC quality decrease from cold to warm bioregions because high quality detritus accumulates preferentially at cool site where decomposition is slow . Finally , decomposition of SOC in FMSW will respond more strongly to warming under aerobic condition than SOC from upland forest soil because of higher accumulation of active SOC in FMSW . To test these hypothesis , we incubated FMSW and upland forest soil at two constant temperature ( 10 and 30 degree C ) for 525-d under aerobic condition and constant moisture . In contrast to our first hypothesis , we observed similarly rapid depletion of active SOC compound at initial stage of incubation across FMSW and upland site , and across the 525-d incubation we observed overall lower SOC decomposition rate in our FMSW soil . In line with our second hypothesis , and across FMWS and upland soil , we found greater SOC loss in the sub-alpine bioregion than both temperate region . In contrast to our last hypothesis , we found no difference in the temperature sensitivity ( Q ( 10 ) ) of SOC decomposition in FMSW and upland forest soil . Critically , total SOC loss ( g SOC per g soil ) wa larger in FMSW because of the large amount of SOC stored in these ecosystem , indicating that despite a lack of difference between FMSW and upland response , the total release of C from FMSW that could result from global warming may be large .

aVThe major source of chromophoric dissolved organic matter ( CDOM ) in coastal water is often terrestrial dissolved organic matter originating in coastal watershed and delivered to the ocean by river or stream . While study of carbon cycling in large river dominate the literature , small river deliver the bulk of the freshwater to coastal water ( similar to 60 % ) . However , the variability of organic matter flux in small river requires high spatial and temporal resolution measurement to adequately represent the process controlling distribution and flux . In this study , CDOM wa measured monthly for 2 year at 15 sampling site throughout a small , coastal , urban watershed ( 300 km ( 2 ) ) , the Neponset River Watershed , and CDOM variability wa found to depend on land use type , discharge/precipitation , and growing degree day ( temperature ) . Forest , wetland , residential , industrial , and golf course CDOM end-members were measured and differentiated using CDOM fluorescence , CDOM absorbance , absorbance slope , total organic carbon and total nitrogen , and photo-and biological lability . Simple statistical model of CDOM end-member behavior could explain 40-70 % of the observed seasonal variability . Using these simple relationship , trend in total CDOM loading behavior can be predicted under various scenario of land use change and global warming . Overall , detailed measurement of CDOM throughout the Neponset River Watershed yield new insight into the watershed process that affect terrestrial CDOM delivery to coastal ocean .

aVMethane is an important greenhouse gas which significantly contributes to global warming . Livestock is a major anthropogenic source of methane emission from agriculture . India posse the world 's largest livestock population of 485 million , with a high degree of diversity in it composition . Among the livestock category , cattle dominate with 38.2 % followed by goat ( 25.7 % ) , buffalo ( 20.2 % ) , sheep ( 12.7 % ) and others ( 3.3 % ) . The detailed state/district-level methane emission inventory by age-groups , indigenous and exotic breed of different livestock category wa estimated using the country-specific and Indian feed standard-based emission coefficient and recent livestock census 2003 . The total methane emission from Indian livestock , which includes enteric fermentation and manure management , wa 11.75 Tg for 2003 . Enteric fermentation account for 10.65 Tg ( similar to 91 % ) compared to 1.09 Tg ( similar to 9 % ) by manure management . Dairy buffalo and indigenous dairy cattle together contribute 60 % of the total methane emission . The three high methane emitter state are Uttar Pradesh ( 14.9 % ) , Rajasthan ( 9.1 % ) and Madhya Pradesh ( 8.5 % ) . The detailed district-level spatial analysis in GIS environment resulted in the identification of cluster of district with high emission . Among these , Mednipur District ( West Bengal ) reported the highest total methane emission of 0.12 Tg . Using the remote sensing-derived livestock available feed/fodder area , the average methane flux from Indian livestock wa computed a 74.4 kg/ha .

aVNeedles were collected from ponderosa and Jeffrey pine tree at three site in the Sierra Nevada , and were assembled into 504 sample and grouped according to five dominant live needle condition - green , winter fleck , sucking insect damage , scale insect damage , and ozone damage - and a random mixture . Reflectance and transmittance measurement of abaxial and adaxial surface were obtained at ca 0.3nm spectral resolution from 400-800nm , and binned to simulate Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer ( AVIRIS ) data . There were no significant difference in optical property between the two surface . Ozone-damaged needle were collected from Jeffrey pine tree at one site , and exhibited significantly different ( family-wise =0.01 ) reflectance and transmittance signature - and significantly different signature slope - at both spectral resolution , from green and winter fleck needle from the same site . Ozone-damaged needle had significantly different ( family-wise =0.01 ) abaxial surface reflectance and reflectance slope signature from all other group of needle , at both spectral resolution . In comparison with three chlorophyll reflectance index , a new red fall index ( RFI ) provides high classification accuracy for ozone-damaged and non-ozone-damaged pine needle ( overall acc.=94 % ; =59 % ) . Thus , ozone-damaged Jeffrey pine needle have a unique spectral signature in relation to dominant needle condition of ponderosa and Jeffrey pine tree .

aVMonitoring the evolution of polar glacier , ice cap and ice stream is of utmost importance because they constitute a good indicator of global climate change and contribute significantly to ongoing sea level rise . Accurate topographic survey are particularly relevant a they reflect the geometric evolution of ice mass . Unfortunately , the precision and/or spatial coverage of current satellite mission ( radar altimetry , ICESat ) or field survey are generally insufficient . Improving our knowledge of the topography of Polar Regions is the goal of the SPIRIT ( SPOT 5 stereoscopic survey of Polar Ice : Reference Images and Topographies ) international polar year ( IPY ) project . SPIRIT will allow ( 1 ) the acquisition of a large archive of SPOT 5 stereoscopic image covering most polar ice mass and , ( 2 ) the delivery of digital terrain model ( DTM ) to the scientific community . Here , we present the architecture of this project and the coverage achieved over northern and southern polar area during the first year of IPY ( July 2007 to April 2008 ) . We also provide the first accuracy assessment of the SPIRIT DTMs . Over Jakobshavn Isbrae ( West Greenland ) , SPIRIT elevation are within +/- 6 m of ICESat elevation for 90 % of the data . Some comparison with ICESat profile over Devon ice cap ( Canada ) , St Elias Mountains ( Alaska ) and west Svalbard confirm the good overall quality of the SPIRIT DTMs although large error are observed in the flat accumulation area of Devon ice cap . We then demonstrate the potential of SPIRIT DTMs for mapping glacier elevation change . The comparison of summer-2007 SPIRIT DTMs with October-2003 ICESat profile show that the thinning of Jakobshavn Isbrae ( by 30-40 m in 4 year ) is restricted to the fast glacier trunk . The thinning of the coastal part of the ice stream ( by over 100 m ) and the retreat of it calving front ( by up to 10 km ) are clearly depicted by comparing the SPIRIT DTM to an ASTER April-2003 DTM .

aVA series of climate model simulation of the 20th Century are analysed to investigate a number of published correlation between index of local economic activity and recent global warming . These correlation have been used to support a hypothesis that the observed surface warming record ha been contaminated in some way and thus overestimate true global warming . However , the basis of the result are correlation over a very restricted set of location ( predominantly western Europe , Japan and the USA ) which project strongly onto naturally occurring pattern of climate variability , or are with field with significant amount of spatial auto-correlation . Across model simulation , the correlation vary widely due to the chaotic weather component in any short-term record . The reported correlation do not fall outside the simulated distribution , and are probably spurious ( i.e . are likely to have arisen from chance alone ) . Thus , though this study can not prove that the global temperature record is unbiased , there is no compelling evidence from these correlation of any large-scale contamination .

aVBoth the global precipitation and evaporation in global warming simulation increase at 1 % -3 % K ( -1 ) , much smaller than the rate suggested from the Clausius-Clapeyron ( C-C ) relation ( 6 % -6.5 % K ( -1 ) ) . However , the reduction of surface sensible heat flux over the global ocean ( 5.2 % K ( -1 ) ) match the difference between the fractional increase of evaporation and the C-C relation , implying that the fractional decrease of the Bowen ratio over the global ocean follows the C-C relation closely . The analysis suggests that the stabilization of the atmospheric boundary layer ( ABL ) in response to global warming is the main factor responsible for the simultaneous reduction of the surface sensible flux and the muted increase in the surface latent heat . Because the stabilization of the ABL cause the same amount of fractional change in both the sensible and latent heat flux , the fractional decrease of the Bowen ratio closely follows the C-C relation . The ABL stabilization mechanism for the muted increase in the global hydrological cycle in response to global warming is physically consistent with two other proposed mechanism , namely , the atmospheric energy constraint and the reduction of convective mass flux .

aVThe biological and aerobic oxidation of methane within the soil cover of municipal solid waste landfill is one an alternative to minimize emission of greenhouse effect gas . This study aim at ass the biological oxidation of methane within the final cover of three landfill in Brazil ( two municipal one and one experimental cell ) . The soil sample obtained from the landfill cover were characterized by geotechnical and microbiological test . In the laboratory the consumption of methane from each sample were evaluated . The result revealed the presence of methanotrophic bacteria and consumption of methane in the laboratory wa observed , which also suggest that there is an inverse relation between the degree of saturation at the time of sampling and the number of methanotrophic bacteria .

aV1 . Water temperature is a key characteristic of stream ecosystem that is gaining scientific and managerial relevance a maximum temperature in aquatic ecosystem increase worldwide . 2 . To ass the effect of surface-subsurface water exchange on stream water temperature pattern , four alluvial reach in the Tagliamento River basin ( NE Italy ) , constrained by geomorphic knickpoints at the upper and lower end , and two to four hyporheic flowpaths within each reach , were continuously studied during summer 2007 and winter 2007-08 . Water temperature wa continuously monitored at the upstream and downstream knickpoints of the floodplain , a well a at discrete upwelling area within each reach . Discharge and vertical hydraulic gradient were measured along the alluvial reach , and the residence time and chemistry of upwelling water were assessed four time during the study . 3 . Discharge variation along the study reach revealed that massive hyporheic exchange occurred in all site , ranging from 21 % in reach 2-52 % in reach 1 . End member mixing analysis showed little influence of ground water , a almost all upwelling water wa freshly infiltrated hyporheic water . Importantly , hyporheic exchange flow shaped surface temperature at the upwelling location in all study reach , providing potential thermal refugia for aquatic biota . At site with highest hyporheic flow rate , net temperature change wa also reflected at the floodplain scale . 4 . The magnitude of the thermal change along a hyporheic flowpath wa not related to the flowpath length but to the estimated ( 222 ) Rn water age . Reduction in the diel thermal amplitude by hyporheic flow rather than net temperature change , reduced temperature extreme . Therefore , restoration activity to create thermal refugia should consider the role of hyporheic flow and enhance the exchange between surface and hyporheic water .

aVIncreased carbon uptake of land in response to elevated atmospheric CO ( 2 ) concentration and nitrogen deposition could slow down the rate of CO ( 2 ) increase and facilitate climate change mitigation . Using a coupled model of climate , ocean , and land biogeochemistry , we show that atmospheric nitrogen deposition and atmospheric CO ( 2 ) have a strong synergistic effect on the carbon uptake of land . Our best estimate of the global land carbon uptake in the 1990s is 1.34 PgC/yr . The synergistic effect could explain 47 % of this carbon uptake , which is higher than either the effect of increasing nitrogen deposition ( 29 % ) or CO ( 2 ) fertilization ( 24 % ) . By 2030 , rising carbon uptake on land ha a potential to reduce atmospheric CO ( 2 ) concentration by about 41 ppm out of which 16 ppm reduction would come from the synergetic response of land to the CO ( 2 ) and nitrogen fertilization effect . The strength of the synergy depends largely on the cooccurrence of high nitrogen deposition region with nonagricultural ecosystem . Our study suggests that reforestation and sensible ecosystem management in industrialized region may have larger potential for climate change mitigation than anticipated .

aVThe likelihood that continuing greenhouse-gas emission will lead to an unmanageable degree of climate change ( 1 ] ha stimulated the search for planetary-scale technological solution for reducing global warming [ 2 ] ( `` geoengineering '' ) , typically characterized by the necessity for costly new infrastructure and industry [ 3 ] . We suggest that the existing global infrastructure associated with arable agriculture can help , given that crop plant exert an important influence over the climatic energy budget [ 4 , 5 ] because of difference in their albedo ( solar reflectivity ) compared to soil and to natural vegetation [ 6 ] . Specifically , we propose a `` bio-geoengineering '' approach to mitigate surface warming , in which crop variety having specific leaf glossiness and/or canopy morphological trait are specifically chosen to maximize solar reflectivity . We quantify this by modifying the canopy albedo of vegetation in prescribed cropland area in a global-climate model , and thereby estimate the near-term potential for bio-geoengineering to be a summertime cooling of more than 1 degree C throughout much of central North America and midlatitude Eurasia , equivalent to seasonally off setting approximately one-fifth of regional warming due to doubling of atmospheric CO ( 2 ) [ 7 ] . Ultimately , genetic modification of plant leaf wax or canopy structure could achieve greater temperature reduction , although better characterization of existing intraspecies variability is needed first .

aVThe global energy requirement ha grown at a phenomenon rate and the consumption of primary energy source ha been a very high positive growth . This paper focus on the consumption of different primary energy source and it identifies that coal will continue to remain a the prime energy source in foreseeable future . It examines the energy requirement perspective for India and demand of coal a the prime energy source . Economic development and poverty alleviation depend on securing affordable energy source and Indian coal mining industry offer a bright future for the country 's energy security , provided the industry is allowed to develop by supportive government policy and adopts latest technology for mining . It is an irony that in-spite of having a plentiful reserve , India is not able to jack up coal production to meet it current and future demand . It discus the strategy to be adopted for growth and meeting the coal demand . But such energy are very much concerned with environmental degradation and must be driven by contemporary managerial acumen addressing environmental and social challenge effectively The paper highlight the emission of greenhouse gas due to burning of fossil fuel and environmental consequence of global warming and sea-level rise . Technological solution for environment friendly coal mining and environmental law for the abatement of environmental degradation are discussed in this paper .

aVHumans are part of the biosphere and dependent upon it . The impact of climate change on 'ecosystem service ' is therefore of extreme concern . Many study demonstrate unequivocally that global warming is shifting the distribution of animal and plant specie , affecting the composition not only of natural ecosystem but of agricultural one a well , and also altering the range and impact of pathogenic organism . The future trajectory of such complex process is hard to map accurately , but even conservative estimate predict substantial specie extinction and change in regional productivity . There is still a chance to significantly mitigate these effect , however , if urgent measure are taken . The biotic effect of climate change are strongly exacerbated by ongoing habitat destruction , which no le urgently need to be halted or reversed by concerted international action . In term of it rate and it human causation , the present crisis is not analogous to past 'natural ' event .

aVIn the present study , two Greek limestone from the Megalopolis and Florina area were used to capture CO ( 2 ) and SO ( 2 ) . The regeneration ability and decay of the limestone sample were investigated through sorption-calcination cycle in a thermogravimetric analyser operated at ambient pressure . The effect of the sorption time ( 3 , 8 and 30 min ) , reaction temperature ( 750 degree C and 850 degree C ) and particle size ( 38-53 , 150-250 and 500-800 mu m ) on the sorbent performance were examined . The two limestone demonstrated similar CO ( 2 ) capture capability . Florina limestone decayed le after a specific number of cycle . When the particle size of the sample increased and the carbonation temperature wa reduced , le CO ( 2 ) capture wa observed for both sample . The presence of SO ( 2 ) inhibited the sorption ability of both limestone . Florina limestone wa found to exhibit a higher sorption ability and lower decay when CO ( 2 ) and SO ( 2 ) were present simultaneously .

aVMost of the great California-Nevada heat wave can be classified into primarily daytime or nighttime event depending on whether atmospheric condition are dry or humid . A rash of nighttime-accentuated event in the last decade wa punctuated by an unusually intense case in July 2006 , which wa the largest heat wave on record ( 1948-2006 ) . Generally , there is a positive trend in heat wave activity over the entire region that is expressed most strongly and clearly in nighttime rather than daytime temperature extreme . This trend in nighttime heat wave activity ha intensified markedly since the 1980s and especially since 2000 . The two most recent nighttime heat wave were also strongly expressed in extreme daytime temperature . Circulations associated with great regional heat wave advect hot air into the region . This air can be dry or moist , depending on whether a moisture source is available , causing heat wave to be expressed preferentially during day or night . A remote moisture source centered within a marine region west of Baja California ha been increasing in prominence because of gradual sea surface warming and a related increase in atmospheric humidity . Adding to the very strong synoptic dynamic during the 2006 heat wave were a prolonged stream of moisture from this southwestern source and , despite the heightened humidity , an environment in which afternoon convection wa suppressed , keeping cloudiness low and daytime temperature high . The relative contribution of these factor and possible relation to global warming are discussed .

aVStudies from throughout the world have provided evidence that climate change is already affecting the ecology and persistence of specie . Japan contributes valuable insight into understanding these change through long-term record of the timing of cherry blossom and other phenomenon of ecological and cultural interest . The wide latitudinal spread of Japan also provides an opportunity to examine specie over a broad range of environmental condition . In this review , we examine phenological study that have taken place in Japan and summarize their significance to climate change and conservation research . In Kyoto , record of the timing of celebration of cherry blossom festival going back to the 9th century reconstruct the past climate and demonstrate the local increase in temperature associated with global warming and urbanization . This record is probably the longest annual record of phenology from anyplace in the world and show that cherry are currently flowering earlier than they have at any time during the previous 1200 year . Detailed mapping of cherry tree flowering time in and around Osaka and other city in Japan show that urbanization cause plant to flower earlier within the city environs than in nearby park and outlying suburban area . Flowering record from a large cherry arboretum at Mt . Takao , on the outskirt of Tokyo , show that both among and within specie , early flowering is associated with greater responsiveness to temperature variation . Lastly , record of phenology for a wide range of plant and animal recorded at over 100 weather station throughout Japan show that specie vary greatly in their phenological response to climate change , and highlight ecological relationship that need to be investigated in the field . Together , these study provide important insight into how specie are responding to climate change in Japan . Further research , particularly targeted field observation and experiment , is needed to build on these finding and to improve our understanding of how climate change is altering biological community and how it will continue to affect them in the future .

aVSea-level rise ( SLR ) due to climate change is a serious global threat : The scientific evidence is now overwhelming . Continued growth of greenhouse gas emission and associated global warming could well promote SLR of 1 m in this century , and unexpectedly rapid breakup of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheet might produce a 3-5 m SLR . In this paper , we ass the consequence of continued SLR for 84 coastal developing country . Geographic Information System ( GIS ) software ha been used to overlay the best available , spatially disaggregated global data on critical impact element ( land , population , agriculture , urban extent , wetland , and GDP ) , with the inundation zone projected for 1-5 m SLR . Our result reveal that ten of million of people in the developing world are likely to be displaced by SLR within this century ; and accompanying economic and ecological damage will be severe for many . At the country level result are extremely skewed , with severe impact limited to a relatively small number of country .

aVDuring the last 30 year , at-sea study of seabird and marine mammal in the ocean south of the Subtropical Front have described an association with major frontal area . More recently , the advancement in microtechnology ha allowed the tracking of individual and investigation into how these marine predator actually use the frontal zone . In this review , we examine 1 ) the relative importance to apex predator of the different frontal zone in term of spatial distribution and carbon flux ; 2 ) the process that determine their preferential use ; and 3 ) how the mesoscale dynamic of frontal structure drive at-sea foraging strategy of these predator . We review published result from southern water and place them in a broader context with respect to what ha been learned about the importance of front in ocean farther north . Some front constitute important boundary for seabird community in southern water . At a mesoscale the maximum value of seabird diversity and abundance correspond to the location of the main front . At-sea survey show a strong curvilinear correlation between seabird abundance and sea surface temperature . High mean specie richness and diversity for whale and seabird are consistently associated with the southern water mass boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current , the Subtropical Front and the Subantarctic Front : in the case of the Polar Front mean seabird density are more variable . At small-scales , variation in seabird occurrence ha been directly related to the process at front in a limited number of case . A significant positive relation wa found between some plankton feeding specie and frontal temperature gradient-phytoplankton variable . Telemetric study have revealed that several apex predator ( penguin , albatross , seal ) perform long , directed foraging trip either to the Subtropical front or Polar Front , depending on locality . Seabirds with low flight cost , such a albatross , are able to reach front at long distance from colony , showing variable foraging strategy a a function of the distance involved . Diving bird such a King penguin , that travel at a higher cost and lower speed . rely on the predictable spatial distribution of mesopelagic fish found close to the Polar Front . They may use the current associated with eddy a oceanographic cue in the active search for frontal zone . Once in these area they dive preferentially in and below the depth of the thermocline where catch per unit effort are high . Elephant seal concentrate foraging activity principally inside or at the boundary of cyclonic eddy . These mesoscale feature appear to offer exceptional productivity favourable for foraging by various diving top predator . The connection between biophysical parameter at front and predator is likely to be made through biological enhancement . Top predator appear to forage at location where prey are advected by physical process and others where prey are produced locally . Long-term research on at-sea distribution and demographic parameter of top predator are essential to ass the consequence of potential shift in front distribution in relation to global warming . Such environmental change would add to the impact of fish extraction by the industrial fishery on the southern food web . ( C ) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All right reserved .

aVIn the next few year , grain legume should be used a a mean of N acquisition in cropping system due to the depletion of non-renewable source of energy . However , this requires improvement in the accuracy with which biological N ( 2 ) fixation , N balance and the N benefit for following crop are estimated . Moreover , grain legume crop are largely influenced by water stress while the world area exposed to drought period may increase in the coming year due to global warming . This work aim to quantify biomass and N accumulation , N partitioning between above and below ground part and N rhizodeposition by a pea ( Pisum sativum L. ) when influenced by water stress . In a controlled environment , pea plant were exposed to a severe drought or not stressed , either at flowering or during pod filling . N rhizodeposition wa measured using the split root method and plant were harvested at the end of flowering ( 59 day after sowing , DAS 59 ) , at the end of the drought period applied during pod filling ( DAS 74 ) and at maturity ( DAS 101 ) . Water stress strongly affected pea dry weight and N accumulation . In both stressed treatment , nodule biomass and N content were reduced by about 65 % in the absence of stress . Regardless of the treatment , total below ground plant N ( root N + N rhizodeposition ; BGN ) and N rhizodeposition were correlated with total plant N content and the proportion of BGN to total plant N wa similar among treatment at each sampling date . At DAS 59 and 74 , the N contained in rhizodeposits represented around 30 % of the total BGN and increased to around 60 % at maturity though BGN decreased from around 20 to 13 % of the total plant N between DAS 74 and maturity . The result suggest that water stress ha no specific effect on N partitioning between above and below ground part . ( c ) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVThe National Oceanographic Partnership Program ( NOPP ) consecutively sponsored the Ocean-Systems for Chemical , Optical , and Physical Experiments ( O-SCOPE ) and Multi-disciplinary Ocean Sensors for Environmental Analyses and Networks ( MOSEAN ) project from 1998 through 2008 . The O-SCOPE and MOSEAN project focused on developing and testing new sensor and system for autonomous , concurrent measurement of biological , chemical , optical , and physical variable from a diverse suite of stationary and mobile ocean platform . Design consideration encompassed extended open-ocean and coastal deployment , instrument durability , biofouling mitigation , data accuracy and precision , near-real-time data telemetry , and economy-the latter being critical for widespread sensor and system utilization . The complementary O-SCOPE and MOSEAN project increased ocean sensing and data telemetry capability for addressing many societally relevant problem such a global climate change , ocean carbon cycling and sequestration , acidification , eutrophication , anoxia , and ecosystem dynamic , including harmful algal bloom . NOPP support enabled O-SCOPE and MOSEAN to accelerate progress in achieving multiscale , multidisciplinary , sustained observation of the ocean environment . Importantly , both program produced value-added scientific result , which demonstrated the utility of these new technology . The NOPP framework fostered strong collaboration among academic , commercial , and government entity , and facilitated technology transfer to the general research community and to long-term observational and observatory program .

aVConsiderable debate surround the assessment of the environmental impact and the ethical justification for providing a year-round supply of fresh produce to consumer in the developed country of northern Europe . Society is seeking environmentally sustainable supply chain which maintain the variety of fresh food on offer throughout the year . This paper compare the environmental impact of different supply chain providing lettuce all year round to the UK and considers consumer ' meaning of-and attitude to-available option . Lettuce ha been selected a a case study a it consumption ha grown steadily during the last two decade and the supply chain through cold month are protected cropping in the UK and field cropping in Spain ; during warm month , lettuce is sourced from field cropping in the UK . Data were collected from farm supplying each of these supply chain , and life cycle assessment methodology wa used to analyse a range of impact associated with producing ( from plant propagation to harvesting and post-harvest cooling ) and delivering 1 kg of lettuce to a UK Regional Distribution Centre ( RDC ) . The downstream stage ( i.e . retailing , consumption and waste management ) are the same regardless of the origin of the product and were omitted from the comparison . The impact considered included potential to induce global warming and acidification a well a three inventory indicator ( primary energy use , land use and water use ) . Qualitative data were collected in order to ass the consumer consideration of purchasing lettuce also during winter . Importation of Spanish field-grown lettuce into the UK during winter produced fewer greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emission than lettuce produced in UK-protected system at that time ( 0.4-0.5 vs. 1.5-3.7 kg CO ( 2 ) -eq/kg lettuce in RDC ) . Refrigerated transport to the UK wa an important element of the global warming potential associated with Spanish lettuce ( 42.5 % of emission ) , whilst energy for heating dominated the result in UK-protected cultivation ( 84.3 % of emission ) . Results for acidification were more variable and no overall trend are apparent . Results from qualitative social analysis revealed complex and multidimensional meaning of freshness and suggested that the most striking seasonal variation in vegetable/salad eating wa a tendency to consume more salad in the summer and more cooked vegetable in the winter , thus suggesting that in-home consumption alone can not explain the rise in winter import of lettuce to the UK . UK field-grown lettuce had the lowest overall environmental impact ; however , those lettuce are only available in summer , so consumer therefore need to either accept the environmental impact associated with eating lettuce in the winter or to switch consumption to another food product in the winter . When lettuce were field-grown in Spain and then transported by road to the UK , the overall impact were similar to the UK field lettuce . The variation within farm of the same country employing different cultivation regime and practice wa bigger than between farm of different country . This paper ha explored the environmental consequence of consuming lettuce year-round in the UK . Whilst recognising the small sample size , the comparative analysis of the different supply chain doe suggest that seasonality can be an important variable when defining the best choice of lettuce from an environmental point of view . Further study considering more production site and product type are required to obtain conclusion whose general validity is clear and for different type of fresh produce . A clear distinction to be made in such study is whether crop are produced in open field or under protection . New characterisation method are needed for environmental impact derived from the use of key agricultural resource such a land and water . Social study to investigate consumer preference and the possibility of moving to more seasonal diet should be an integral part of these study using sample composed of both urban and rural consumer and using a mixed methodology with both quantitative and qualitative component .

aVBackground : Reef-building coral live in symbiosis with a diverse range of dinoflagellate algae ( genus Symbiodinium ) that differentially influence the fitness of the coral holobiont . The comparative role of symbiont type in holobiont fitness in relation to host genotype or the environment , however , is largely unknown . We addressed this knowledge gap by manipulating host-symbiont combination and comparing growth , survival and thermal tolerance among the resultant holobionts in different environment . Methodology/Principal Findings : Offspring of the coral , Acropora millepora , from two thermally contrasting location , were experimentally infected with one of six Symbiodinium type , which spanned three phylogenetic clade ( A , C and D ) , and then outplanted to the two parental field location ( central and southern inshore Great Barrier Reef , Australia ) . Growth and survival of juvenile coral were monitored for 31-35 week , after which their thermo-tolerance wa experimentally assessed . Our result showed that : ( 1 ) Symbiodinium type wa the most important predictor of holobiont fitness , a measured by growth , survival , and thermo-tolerance ; ( 2 ) growth and survival , but not heat-tolerance , were also affected by local environmental condition ; and ( 3 ) host population had little to no effect on holobiont fitness . Furthermore , coral-algal association were established with symbiont type belonging to clade A , C and D , but three out of four symbiont type belonging to clade C failed to establish a symbiosis . Associations with clade A had the lowest fitness and were unstable in the field . Lastly , Symbiodinium type C1 and D were found to be relatively thermo-tolerant , with type D conferring the highest tolerance in A. millepora . Conclusions/Significance : These result highlight the complex interaction that occur between the coral host , the algal symbiont , and the environment to shape the fitness of the coral holobiont . An improved understanding of the factor affecting coral holobiont fitness will assist in predicting the response of coral to global climate change .

aVA variety of approach have previously been developed to estimate the fraction of terrestrial or marine organic carbon present in aquatic sediment . The task of quantifying each component is especially important for the Arctic due to the region ' sensitivity to global climate change and the potential for enhanced terrestrial organic carbon input with continued Arctic warming to alter carbon sequestration . Yet it is unclear how each approach compare in de . ning organic carbon source in sediment a well a their impact on regional or pan-Arctic carbon budget . Here , we investigated multiple method : ( 1 ) two end-member mixing model utilizing bulk stable carbon isotope ; ( 2 ) the relationship between long-chain n-alkanes and organic carbon ( ALKOC ) ; ( 3 ) principal component analysis ( PCA ) combined with scaling of a large suite of lipid biomarkers ; and ( 4 ) ratio of branched and isoprenoid glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether lipid ( the BIT index ) to calculate the fraction of terrestrial organic matter component preserved in Arctic marine sediment . Estimated terrestrial organic carbon content among approach showed considerable variation for identical sediment sample . For a majority of the sample , the BIT index resulted in the lowest estimate for terrestrial organic carbon , corroborating recent suggestion that this proxy may represent a distinct fraction of terrestrial organic matter ; i.e. , peat or soil organic matter , a opposed to marker such a n-alkanes or long-chain fatty acid which measure higher plant wax input . Because of the patchy input of n-alkanes to this region from coastal erosion in the western Arctic , the ALKOC approach wa not a effective a when applied to river-dominated margin found in the eastern Arctic . The difficulty in constraining a marine delta ( 13 ) C end-member limit the applicability of stable isotope mixing model in polar region . Estimates of terrestrial organic carbon using the lipid-based PCA method and the bulk delta ( 13 ) C mixing model approach varied drastically at each site , suggesting that organic matter fraction such a amino acid or carbohydrate may affect bulk organic matter composition in a manner that is not captured in the lipid-based analysis . Overall , terrestrial organic matter input to the Chukchi and western Beaufort Seas using the average of the method at each site ranged from 11 % to 44 % , indicating that land-derived organic matter play a substantial role in carbon dynamic in the western Arctic Ocean .

aVThe survival of alpine specie in changing climate depends on dispersal or adaptation . However , it is unclear whether trait variability along elevation/climatic gradient is adaptive or represents stress towards lower/warmer elevation , particularly for the endangered endemic for which protected status and plant longevity preclude experimental study . We chose one such specie , known for it phenotypic variability ( Primula glaucescens , endemic to the southern Alps ) , and quantified key functional trait in situ throughout it range , correlating these with elevation a a proxy for climate . Larger leaf were evident towards lower elevation , but tissue nitrogen dilution and limited regenerative fitness were symptomatic of stress . Specific leaf area , a correlate of relative growth rate , wa consistently low : the entire specie exhibit conservative leaf economy and inherently slow growth . This seemingly variable specie exhibit superficial variability around a fundamentally conservative , cold-adapted survival strategy , and thus phenotypic variability is unlikely to facilitate the persistence of alpine endemic during rapid climate warming .

aVBeginning with Brazil and the US , biofuels are being produced in a growing number of country at large scale . Jobs are created in rural area , air quality improves in urban area , global warming is mitigated , oil import decrease , and foreign exchange is saved . Nevertheless , the expansion of biofuels in large scale raise concern about the environmental impact at the production site , the competition with food supply , the threat to existing eco-systems such a the rain forest , etc. , and maintaining fair social standard . Not every country in the world should be producing biofuels . Only a discrete number of country should engage in biofuels production , mainly in the developing world . But , all country can benefit from consuming biofuels . All energy commodity today are traded internationally , without restriction , except biofuels . Interested country must discus and agree on a Global BioPact , to promote unimpeded international trade of biofuels within the bound of sustainable production , transport , and use . Such trade will improve the economic , social , and environmental sustainability of biofuels .

aVIn this study , the solar radiation data of Balikesir in Turkey are analysed to ass the techno-economic viability and environmental performance of a hybrid Photovoltaic ( PV ) -diesel-battery system to meet the load requirement of a typical remote farm house . Several aspect of the system are studied through the Cost of Energy ( CoE ) , the operational hour of diesel generator , unmet load , excess electricity generation , percentage of fuel saving , etc . The CoE for this kind of hybrid system is found to be 1.245 US $ /kWh . Simulations are performed for three case ( diesel only , PV-diesel and PV-diesel-battery ) . It is found that a diesel-only system produce 63 900 kWh of electricity and 69.7 tonne of CO ( 2 ) , 13.0 kg of PM , 1.53 tonne of NO ( x ) emission per year . Using PV-diesel and PV-diesel-battery system help reduce the emission for CO ( 2 ) to 61.0 and 42.0 tonne , for PM to 11.4 and 7.83 kg and for NO ( x ) to 1.34 and 0.92 tonne , respectively . The diesel-only system is more economical if the fuel price remains below US $ 2/L . Otherwise , PV-diesel and PV-diesel-battery system become more cost-effective . Also , the environmental impact improvement factor is found a 0.127 and 0.399 for CO ( 2 ) , 0.123 and 0.397 for PM and 0.124 and 0.398 for NO ( x ) for both PV-diesel and PV-diesel-battery system , respectively .

aVA rock avalanche of about 3 . 10 ( 6 ) m ( 3 ) detached from the South-East flank of the Punta Thurwieser ridge ( Italian Central Alps ) on the 18th of September , 2004 . Due to the characteristic of the moving material ( i.e . rock , debris , ice , snow ) and the path of propagation ( e.g . presence of a glacier ) , the mass wa able to rapidly cover long distance ( about 3000 m ) . Among the possible cause of the event , attention is mainly focused on permafrost degradation and change in glacier extension due to global warming . In the present work , the dynamic of the event and the role played by characteristic of the propagation path are numerically investigated with the RASH3D code , based on a continuum mechanic approach . Results obtained with two theological hypothesis ( Frictional and Voellmy ) are compared and discussed . In particular , it emerges that 1 ) the use of a Voellmy rheology with a reduced friction angle on the glacier is necessary to reproduce the dynamic of the Thurwieser event , and 2 ) a lack in knowledge of geometrical and geomechanical information may lead to wrong interpretation of the event and inaccurate calibration of numerical model .

aVThe use of cap-and-trade to regulate air pollution promise to achieve environmental goal at lower cost than traditional prescriptive approach . Cap-and-trade ha been applied to various air pollutant including sulphur dioxide , nitrogen oxide and volatile organic compound in the United States and carbon dioxide ( CO ( 2 ) ) in the European Union . This corresponds to what is likely to become the most expensive environmental undertaking in history - the effort to reduce the heating of the planet . However , the efficacy of a cap-and-trade policy for CO ( 2 ) depends in large part on the design of the program . In addition to the level of the cap , the most important decision facing policymakers will be the initial allocation of emission allowance . The method used to allocate tradable emission allowance will have significant influence on the distributional impact and efficiency of the program .

aVSolar activity is studied using a cluster analysis of the time-fluctuations of the sunspot number . It is shown that in an Historic period the high activity component of the solar cycle exhibit strong clustering , whereas in a Modern period ( last seven solar cycle : 1933-2007 ) they exhibit a white-noise ( non- ) clustering behavior . Using this observation , it is shown that in the Historic period , emergence of the sunspot in the solar photosphere wa strongly dominated by turbulent photospheric convection . In the Modern period , this domination wa broken by a new more active dynamic of the inner layer of the convection zone . Then , it is shown that the dramatic change of the sun dynamic at the transitional period ( between the Historic and Modern period , solar cycle 1933-1944 ) had a clear detectable impact on the Earth 's climate . A scenario of a chain of transition in the solar convective zone is suggested in order to explain the observation , and a forecast for global warming is suggested on the basis of this scenario . A relationship between the recent transition and solar long-period chaotic dynamic ha been found . ( C ) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All right reserved .

aVOBJECTIVES To study climatological and public health event which might have affected the 2007 two-wave dengue outbreak in Taiwan , an island with both tropical and subtropical region , where the 2007 dengue incidence exceeded the combined total of the previous four year . METHODS A multi-phase Richards model wa fitted to weekly cumulative dengue data to pinpoint the turning point of the outbreak . We obtained the 'initial ' reproduction number for the two wave of the outbreak . By mean of correlation analysis we explored the possible impact of climatological event on the occurrence of turning point . RESULTS Three turning point occurred around early August , late August/early September , and late October/early November . The 'initial ' reproduction number for the first wave wa R ( i ) = 4.67 ( 95 % CI : 0*-10.92 ) , where 0* = max\u005c { 0 , lower bound\u005c } , and R ( i ) = 3.93 ( 95 % CI : 1.74-6.13 ) for the second wave . The highest correlation wa between dengue incidence and two climatological variable : maximum temperature at a lag of 5 week ( r = 0.66 and 0.71 ) and total precipitation at a lag of seven week ( r = 0.53 ) . CONCLUSIONS The first two turning point were partially attributable to two typhoon around early to mid-August that brought a sharp drop in temperature and substantial rainfall . The drop in temperature first drove the dengue incidence down , then the rainfall drove it up at the beginning of fall . In recent year , Taiwan ha witnessed increasingly frequent large summer dengue outbreak that persisted into early winter , perhaps due to warmer autumn . This highlight the possible impact of global warming on the spread of infectious disease .

aVMethane ( CH ( 4 ) ) flux from northern wetland may have influenced atmospheric CH ( 4 ) concentration at climate warming phase during the last 800 000 year and during the present global warming . Including these CH ( 4 ) flux in earth system model is essential to understand feedback between climate and atmospheric composition . Attempts to model CH ( 4 ) flux from wetland have previously been undertaken using various approach . Here , we test a process-based wetland CH ( 4 ) flux model ( PEATLANDVU ) which includes detail of soil-atmosphere CH ( 4 ) transport . The model ha been used to simulate CH ( 4 ) emission from continental Europe in previous glacial climate and the current climate . This paper present result regarding the sensitivity of modeling glacial terrestrial CH ( 4 ) flux to ( a ) basic tuning parameter of the model , ( b ) different approach in modeling of the water table , and ( c ) model structure . In order to test the model structure , PEATLAND-VU wa compared to a simpler modeling approach based on wetland primary production estimated from a vegetation model ( BIOME 3.5 ) . The tuning parameter are the CH ( 4 ) production rate from labile organic carbon and it temperature sensitivity . The modelled flux prove comparatively insensitive to hydrology representation , while sensitive to microbial parameter and model structure . Glacial climate emission are also highly sensitive to assumption about the extent of ice cover and exposed seafloor . Wetland expansion over low relief exposed seafloor area have compensated for a decrease of wetland area due to continental ice cover .

aVCoal gasification is a promising option for the future use of coal . Similarly to gasification in industrial reactor , underground coal gasification ( UCG ) produce syngas , which call be used for power generation or for the production of liquid hydrocarbon fuel and other valuable chemical product . As compared with conventional mining and surface gasification , UCG promise lower capital/operating cost and also ha other advantage , such a no human labor underground . In addition , UCG ha the potential to be linked with carbon capture and sequestration . The increasing demand for energy , depletion of oil and gas resource , and threat of global climate change lead to growing interest in UCG throughout the world . In this article , we review the current status of this technology , focusing on recent development in various country .

aVIn connection with global warming , the growth in the intensity of tropical hurricane is predicted . The onset of this intensification is partially illustrated by the western Atlantic cyclonic zone [ 1 ] . It is noted in [ 1 ] that , due to global warming , the sea-surface temperature ( SST ) over the entire world ha increased by 0.6A degree C since 1970 . Since the SST basically determines the energy of tropical hurricane , it is inferred that global warming will lead to an enhancement in their intensity . This publication present a plot of the dynamic of SST annual mean anomaly for the northwestern Atlantic and pay special attention to significant excess mean temperature since 1994 . The anomaly are determined with respect to the mean temperature calculated from SSTs over 1901-1970 . The same plot also show that the SST at the end of the 1940s and during the 1950s exceeded the mean temperature by about 0.3 or even 0.4A degree C , decreasing gradually to negative anomaly ( -0.3A degree C ) in 1973 . After that , the temperature started to increase again . Figure 1 show a detail of this plot , which relates to the period 1950-2000 .

aVThe Himalayas ha one of the largest concentration of glacier and permanent snowfield outside the polar region . Snow and glacier melt form an important source for many river originating in the Himalayas . Numerous study suggest that global warming ha started affecting snow melt and stream run-off in the Himalayan region . Monitoring the snow-cover change is therefore essential to ass the future hydrologic cycle . Snowline altitude is an important parameter to ass future change in snow cover . Variations in snowline altitude and snow cover for the year 2004-05 and 2006-07 between October and June for Baspa River Basin located in the Kinnaur District , Himachal Pradesh are reported here . The snow cover wa delineated using 54 image of AWiFS senor of Resourcesat-I satellite using NDSI technique and elevation information wa generated using SRTM data . About 98 % of the basin area is located below the elevation of 5800 m. The average monthly snowline altitude wa estimated . The lowest snowline altitude wa observed a 2425 m in February 2004-05 and 2846.25 m in March in 2006-07 .

aVThe West Sichuan Plateau is located in the southeast margin of the Tibetan Plateau , where the climate is mainly influenced by the Indian southwest summer monsoon and the Tibetan Plateau monsoon . In this study , detailed geochemical analysis ha been carried out on Ganzisi loess-paleosol sequence in Ganze County of western Sichuan Province . The result indicate that Ganze loess and paleosol have experienced the incipient stage of chemical weathering in dust source region , characterized by the decomposition of plagioclase which caused the depletion of mobile element Na and Ca . The post-depositional chemical weathering is characterized by carbonate dissolution and oxidation of Fe ( 2+ ) The variation of some geochemical index ( such a CIA value , Na/K and Fe ( 2+ ) /Fe ( 3+ ) ratio ) in Ganzisi loess-paleosol sequence indicate a gradually decreased chemical weathering intensity in the dust source region and deposition area since 1.15 Ma BP consistent with the general increase of global ice volume , reflecting that the arid trend since 1.15 Ma BP in the southeast Tibetan Plateau is a regional response to the global climate change . The geochemical index in this section also reveal an obvious drying step occurred at about 250 ka BP in this region . We interpret this drying step a a result of decreased influence of the Indian southwest summer monsoon . This decrease in monsoon moisture is probably attributable to the uplift of the southeast margin of the Tibetan Plateau at about 250 ka BP .

aVGlobal movement of horse and men , climate change , global warming etc . are responsible for the increasing immigration of foreign organism and an international exchange of infectious disease . In this context the vector-borne disease of equine and human being are of special significance . Environmental factor , climate - driven change are the reason for change in the size and activity of specific vector population . They have significant influence to the biological behaviour of many different arthropod - acting a biovectors - and enable their transmission in previously non endemic area , country or continent . Factors that determine population of reservoir and amplifying host are in part due to the weather , winter mortality of adult and success of hatching . This is linked to management of land , agriculture , watering practising and the presence of wildlife host . Different population of mosquito are sensitve to natural and man-induced factor . Climate change in the sense of global warming support overwintering , which depends on temperature and snow cover . Summer population are largely determined by the right quantity and frequency of rainfall , high humidity and warm temperature . Low temperature and low humidity can reduce it and low temperature can also slow down the growth of virus in the vector mosquito . In this context the north-word migration of competent biovectors ( arthropod ) have established disease in formerly non-endemic area . Examples are the West Nile Virus ( WNV ) and the Virus of African Horse Sickness ( AHS ) expanding into the northern hemisphere . WNV belongs to the Japanese - B- Encephalitis complex , and AHS is an orbivirus . American Encephalomyelititides of Equidae ( EEE , WEE , VEE ) - belonging to the Flaviviruses - are also dependent on suitable weather condition , but many other variable factor in their epidemic occurrence and spread are involved . WEE and EEE - like WNV - are maintained in nature between mosquito and bird , VEE between mosquito , bird and different , portly unidentified rodent . Cases of EEE or WEE have been reported from different Asiatic country . In contrast to the mentioned virus , which affect men and horse , the Equine Infectious Anaemia ( EIA ) is caused by a lentivirus and affect only equides . The virus can be transmitted by blood suckling biovectors , but also by different ex- and secretion , foetal infection , colostrum , tissue , blood transfusion , plasmaproducts etc . We have to consider that the invasion of EIA from endemic country like Italy or region in different country like Romania and others into non-endemic country is easy , supported by missing diagnostic test and experience , uncontrolled horse travelling and import , missing documentation etc . Tick borne disease infecting men and horse are also common , example are the Early Summer Meningoencephalitis ( Flavivirus ) and infection caused by bacterium belonging to the familiy Boerrelia and Anaplasma . The chance of disease from the mentioned virus and bacterium and their invasion into new country can be reduced and controlled only by a coordinated strategy plan combining environmental management procedure , vector surveillance and control , surveillance of reservoir in domestic animal , wild fauna - esp . bird - and human and specific preventive measurement . The primary goal is to reduce vector population by identifying and eliminating breeding and resting site , use of larvacide and insecticide . International coordination in data and reporting system , im- and export control of animal , standardization and validation of diagnostic test have to go hand in hand .

aVAn atmosphere-ocean-vegetation coupled model is used to quantify the biogeophysical feedback that emerges a vegetation adjusts dynamically to a quadrupling of atmospheric CO ( 2 ) . This feedback amplifies global warming by 13 % . About half of it is due to climatically induced expansion of boreal forest into tundra , reinforced by reduction in snow and sea ice cover . The other half represents a global climatic effect of increased vegetative cover ( an indirect consequence of plant physiological response to CO ( 2 ) ) in the semi-arid subtropics . Enhanced absorption of shortwave radiation in these region produce a net surface warming , which the atmosphere communicates poleward . The greatest vegetation-induced warming is co-located with large , vulnerable carbon store in the north . These lose carbon , so that in the long term , the biospheric response to CO ( 2 ) and climate change becomes dominated by positive feedback that overwhelm the effect of CO ( 2 ) fertilization on terrestrial carbon stock .

aVDuring the last decade many electronic database of vegetation plot , mainly phytosociological releves , were established in different European country . These database contain information which is extremely valuable for both testing various macroecological hypothesis and for nature conservation surveying or monitoring . The aim of this paper is to provide estimate of the number of vegetation plot there are in Europe , how many are stored in an electronic format and to ass their distribution across European country and region . We sent a questionnaire to the manager of national or regional database of vegetation plot and other prominent vegetation ecologist . Meta-data obtained in this way indicate that there are > 4,300,000 vegetation-plot record in Europe , of which > 1,800,000 are already stored electronically . Of the electronic plot , 60 % are stored in TURBOVEG database . Most plot record probably exist in Germany , the Netherlands , France , Poland , Spain , Czech Republic , Italy , UK , Switzerland and Austria . The largest number of plot per unit area are in the Netherlands , Belgium , Denmark and country of central Europe . The most computerized plot per country exist in the Netherlands ( 600,000 ) , followed by France , the Czech Republic and the UK . Due to it strong phytosociological tradition , Europe ha many more vegetation plot than any other part of the world , This wealth of unique ecological information is a challenge for future biodiversity study . With the alarming loss in biodiversity and environmental problem like global warming and ongoing change in land use , there is an urgent need for wide-scale scientific and applied vegetation research . Developments of information system such a SynBioSys Europe and facilitation of data flow between the national and regional database should make it easier to use these vegetation-plot data .

aVGlobal effort to mitigate climate change are guided by projection of future temperature ( 1 ) . But the eventual equilibrium global mean temperature associated with a given stabilization level of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration remains uncertain ( 1-3 ) , complicating the setting of stabilization target to avoid potentially dangerous level of global warming ( 4-8 ) . Similar problem apply to the carbon cycle : observation currently provide only a weak constraint on the response to future emission ( 9-11 ) . Here we use ensemble simulation of simple climate-carbon-cycle model constrained by observation and projection from more comprehensive model to simulate the temperature response to a broad range of carbon dioxide emission pathway . We find that the peak warming caused by a given cumulative carbon dioxide emission is better constrained than the warming response to a stabilization scenario . Furthermore , the relationship between cumulative emission and peak warming is remarkably insensitive to the emission pathway ( timing of emission or peak emission rate ) . Hence policy target based on limiting cumulative emission of carbon dioxide are likely to be more robust to scientific uncertainty than emission-rate or concentration target . Total anthropogenic emission of one trillion tonne of carbon ( 3.67 trillion tonne of CO ( 2 ) ) , about half of which ha already been emitted since industrialization began , result in a most likely peak carbon-dioxide-induced warming of 2 degree C above pre-industrial temperature , with a 5-95 % confidence interval of 1.3-3.9 degree C .

aVGlobal warming ha become a notable trend especially since an abrupt climate change in 1976 . Response of the East China Sea ( ECS ) to the global warming trend , however , is not well understood because of sparse long-term observation . In this paper , hydrographic observation data of 1957-1996 are collected and reviewed to study climatological variability in northern ECS . Significant warming trend are found in both summer and winter . In summer , the average SST is about 0.46A degree C higher during the period of 1977-1996 than that of 1957-1976 , and the Taiwan Warm Current Water ( TWCW ) wa strengthened . In winter , despite of the cooling effect in the coastal area adjacent to the Changjiang ( Yangtze ) River Estuary ( CRE ) , the average SST increase wa about 0.53A degree C during the same period . The cause of this SST warming up in summer are different from in winter . The warming trend and intensification of the TWCW in summer were primarily influenced by the strengthening of the Kuroshio transport , while the warming in winter wa mainly induced by the variability of the climate system .

aVMineral trapping is one of the safest way to store CO ( 2 ) underground a C will be immobilized in a solid phase . Carbon dioxide will be , therefore , sequestered for geological period of time , helping to diminish greenhouse gas emission and mitigate global warming . Although mineral trapping is considered a fairly long process , owing to the existence of kinetic barrier for mineral precipitation , it ha been demonstrated both experimentally and by numerical modeling . Here the result of experimental and numerical modeling study performed in sandstone of the saline aquifer of the Rio Bonito Formation , Parang Basin , are presented . The Rio Bonito Formation consists of paralic sandstone deposited in the intracratonic Parand Basin , southern Brazil , during the Permian ( Artinskian-Kungurian ) . These rock have the largest potential for CO ( 2 ) storage because of their appropriated reservoir quality , depth and proximity to the most important stationary CO ( 2 ) source in Brazil . Here it is suggested that CO ( 2 ) can be permanently stored a carbonate a CO ( 2 ) reacts with rock of the Rio Bonito Formation and form CaCO ( 3 ) at temperature and pressure similar to those encountered for CO ( 2 ) storage in geological formation . Results of this work will be useful for study of partitioning mechanism for C trapping in CO ( 2 ) storage program . ( C ) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVThe study show that in the scenario of global warming temperature gradient ( TG ) between Indian landmass and Arabian Sea/Bay of Bengal is significantly decreasing in the lower troposphere with maximum around 850 hPa . TG during pre-monsoon ( March to May ) is reducing at a significant rate of 0.036 degrees/year ( Arabian Sea ) and 0.030 degrees/year ( Bay of Bengal ) . The above alarming result are based on sixty year ( 1948-2007 ) of daily temperature and wind data extracted from CDAS-NCEP/NCAR reanalysis datasets . TG based on ERA-40 data also indicates a decreasing trend of 0.0229 degrees/year and 0.0397 degrees/year for Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal respectively . As TG is not governed by any type of significant oscillation , there is a possibility of TG tending to zero . It is further observed that the rate of warming over the ocean is more than that over the land which ha resulted into the weakening of TG . Pre-monsoon TG ha significant correlation with All India Seasonal Monsoon Rainfall ( AISMR ) , kinetic energy of wave 1 and 2 at 850 hPa , kinetic energy , and stream function at 850 hPa over Indian landmass during monsoon season . Except AISMR , the decreasing trend observed in all the above parameter axe significant . All India rainfall for July and August together show a significant decreasing trend of 0.995 mm/year . Reducing number of depression and cyclonic storm and increasing number of break day during monsoon over India are the reflection of the weakening of TG .

aVGlobal climate change is recognized a a threat to specie survival and the health of natural system . Scientists worldwide are looking at the ecological and hydrological impact resulting from climate change . Climate change will make future effort to restore and manage wetland more complex . Wetland system are vulnerable to change in quantity and quality of their water supply , and it is expected that climate change will have a pronounced effect on wetland through alteration in hydrological regime with great global variability . Wetland habitat response to climate change and the implication for restoration will be realized differently on a regional and mega-watershed level , making it important to recognize that specific restoration and management plan will require examination by habitat . Flood-plains , mangrove , seagrass , saltmarshes , arctic wetland , peatlands , freshwater marsh and forest are very diverse habitat , with different stressor and hence different management and restoration technique are needed . The Sundarban ( Bangladesh and India ) , Mekong river delta ( Vietnam ) , and southern Ontario ( Canada ) are example of major wetland complex where the effect of climate change are evolving in different way . Thus , successful long term restoration and management of these system will hinge on how we choose to respond to the effect of climate change . How will we choose priority for restoration and research ? Will enough water be available to rehabilitate currently damaged , water-starved wetland ecosystem ? This is a policy paper originally produced at the request of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands and incorporates opinion , interpretation and scientific-based argument .

aVThe sedimentary architecture of an alpine alluvial fan with a surface of 300,000 m ( 2 ) near Samedan , Switzerland , wa three-dimensionally investigated using 9 km of ground penetrating radar section with a penetration depth of 10 m. Radar facies pattern could be very well calibrated to sedimentology and dated horizon due to a 300 m long outcrop section at the foot of the fan . Six major reflector have been identified and represent first order , fan-wide palaeosurfaces . They are made up of up to 20 cm thick fine-grained deposit partly with initial pedogenetic structure and wood remains which yielded age between 5670 +/- 60 and 7515 +/- 65 a ( 14 ) C BP . Between these surface different depositional lobe and specific architectural element like channel , levee or snout of debris flow could be identified . All these data were geo-referenced to establish a complete quantitative 3-D time-stratigraphic framework . This allowed u to calculate deposited sediment volume and sediment flux for different time slice between the dated palaeosurfaces . Sediment flux show an overall decline during the Holocene which we interpret : a the decling sediment production in the catchment area a function of the paraglacial cycle . Since the middle Atlantic period , the aggradation of the fan almost ceased and climate perturbation are no longer reflected in the sedimentary record since then . Within the aggradation period , distinct peak of high sediment flux could be correlated with known period of glacier retreat in the Swiss Alps , which point to a high sensitivity of the system to climate change . The result of our study give valuable new insight into threshold of activity and quiescence of an alpine catchment-fan system and it stage in the course of a paraglacial cycle . Although very important for the understanding of such dynamic system under global warming scenario and geo-risk assessment , such data set are rarely available . ( C ) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

aVMethane emission from peatlands contributes substantially to global warming but is significantly reduced by sulfate reduction , which is fuelled by globally increasing aerial sulfur pollution . However , the biology behind sulfate reduction in terrestrial ecosystem is not well understood and the key player for this process a well a their abundance remained unidentified . Comparative 16S rRNA gene stable isotope probing ( SIP ) in the presence and absence of sulfate indicated that a Desulfosporosinus specie , which constitutes only 0.006 % of the total microbial community 16S rRNA gene , is an important sulfate reducer in a long-term experimental peatland field site . Parallel SIP using dsrAB ( encoding subunit A and B of the dissimilatory ( bi ) sulfite reductase ) identified no additional sulfate reducer under the condition tested . For the identified Desulfosporosinus specie a high cell-specific sulfate reduction rate of up to 341 fmol SO ( 4 ) ( 2- ) cell ( -1 ) day ( -1 ) wa estimated . Thus , the small Desulfosporosinus population ha the potential to reduce sulfate in situ at a rate of 4.0-36.8 nmol ( g soil w . wt . ) ( -1 ) day ( -1 ) , sufficient to account for a considerable part of sulfate reduction in the peat soil . Modeling of sulfate diffusion to such highly active cell identified no limitation in sulfate supply even at bulk concentration a low a 10 mu M. Collectively , these data show that the identified Desulfosporosinus specie , despite being a member of the 'rare biosphere ' , contributes to an important biogeochemical process that diverts the carbon flow in peatlands from methane to CO ( 2 ) and , thus , alters their contribution to global warming .

aVThe Adirondack Mountains of New York State hold some of the southernmost community of alpine vegetation in the eastern United States . Containing the greatest concentration of rare and endangered specie in New York State , this similar to 12,000-year-old ecosystem is important to understanding the ecological history of northeastern North America . In order to monitor floristic and vegetational shift over time , 11 permanent transects were established in 1984 on four summit ( Wright , Algonquin , Boundary , and Iroquois ) of the MacIntyre Range in the Adirondack High Peaks region . Using the point-intercept method , all 11 transects were sampled in 1984 , 1994 , 2002 , and 2007 . Vegetation composition changed significantly over the 23-year period , with an overall decrease in bryophytes/lichens and an increase in vascular plant , indicating that vascular plant were replacing bryophyte , particularly in area not disturbed by hiker . Community similarity wa high among all transects , and increased with time for vascular plant a they became more abundant , indicating a successional convergence . Compositional shift may also reflect effect of global warming and atmospheric deposition on alpine plant community .

aVWidespread concern about global biodiversity loss have led to a growing demand for index of biodiversity status . Today , climate change is among the most serious threat to global biodiversity . Although many study have revealed phenological response to climate change , no long-term community-level index have been developed . We derived a 250-year index of first flowering date for 405 plant specie in the UK for assessing the impact of climate change on plant community . The estimated community-level index in the most recent 25 year wa 2.2-12.7 day earlier than any other consecutive 25-year period since 1760 . The index wa closely correlated with February-April mean Central England Temperature , with flowering 5.0 day earlier for every 1 degree C increase in temperature . The index wa relatively sensitive to the number of specie , not record per specie , included in the model . Our result demonstrate how multi-species , multiple-site phenological event can be integrated to obtain index showing trend for each specie and across specie . This index should play an important role in monitoring the impact of climate change on biodiversity . Furthermore , this approach can be extended to incorporate data from other taxon and country for evaluating cross-taxa and cross-country phenological response to climate change .

aVThe management of plastic waste is important owing to the high level of embodied fossil fuel energy they contain . Although the environmental benefit of closed-loop recycling of plastic have been established through a number of life cycle study , the benefit of open-loop recycling of plastic have not been examined for many substituted material . This paper compare two equivalent sports-field drainage system , one based on conventional sand and aggregate drainage material , the other incorporating a novel drainage material produced from mixed plastic waste . The scope is confined to an analysis of primary energy consumption and global warming potential . It wa found that the novel drainage system had lower global warming potential and primary energy consumption than the conventional system . These result were robust to sensitivity analysis of electricity mix and transportation distance to installation . ( C ) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All right reserved .

aVDue to the problem of global warming , the green supply chain management , in particular , closed-loop logistics , ha drawn the attention of researcher . Although there were logistics model that were examined in the literature , most of them were case based and not in a closed-loop . Therefore , they lacked generality and could not serve the purpose of recycling , reuse and recovery required in a green supply chain . In this study , the integration of forward and reverse logistics wa investigated , and a generalized closed-loop model for the logistics planning wa proposed by formulating a cyclic logistics network problem into an integer linear programming model . Moreover , the decision for selecting the place of manufactory , distribution center , and dismantlers with the respective operation unit were supported with the minimum cost . A revised spanning-tree based genetic algorithm wa also developed by using determinant encoding representation for solving this NP model . Numerical experiment were presented , and the result showed that the proposed model and algorithm were able to support the logistic decision in a closed-loop supply chain efficiently and accurately . Statement of scope and purpose This study concern with operation of 3R in the green supply chain logistics and the location selection optimization . Based on 'cradle to cradle ' principle of a green product , a `` closed-loop '' structure of a network wa proposed in order to integrate the environmental issue into a traditional logistic system . Due to NP-hard nature of the model , a Genetic Algorithm , which is based on spanning tree structure wa developed . Test problem from the small size for accuracy to the large scale for efficiency have been demonstrated with comparison . The promising result have shown the applicability of the proposed model with the solution procedure . ( C ) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVDiesel vehicle account for the majority of new vehicle sale in Europe . This is due to inherent fuel efficiency and high reliability . Global warming concern have seen demand for renewable alternative to fossil diesel with low carbon dioxide ( CO ( 2 ) ) producing emission . Oxygenated biodiesel fuel such a rapeseed methyl ester ( RME ) can be utilized in an unmodified conventional diesel engine . RME combustion produce low emission of unburnt total hydrocarbon ( THCs ) , carbon monoxide ( CO ) , and particulate matter ( PM ) . This is due in part to fuel-born oxygen content ( 10.8 % wt ) . This study examines the effect of adding fuel-born oxygen in the form of dimethyl carbonate ( DMC ) ( a nontoxic potentially bioderived 53.3 % wt oxygenated additive ) to conventional pump diesel . It wa found that nitrogen oxide ( NO ( x ) ) increased and that THCs , CO , and PM were reduced by up to 50 % with a 96 % diesel , 4 % DMC blend . Interestingly 2 % DMC in diesel can generate comparable particulate , THCs and CO emission to RME combustion , at just 1.1 % wt oxygen . A DMC blend may also have potential in the reduction of a yet unregulated carcinogenic emission such a benzene and 1,3-butadiene .

aVCoastal South Africa draw interdisciplinary interest due to the co-occurrence of a rich record for early human behavioral modernity , hyper-diverse vegetation with very high endemism ( the Cape Floral Region ) , and globally influential oceanic and climate system . High resolution and continuous climate and environmental record are needed to provide the context for the evolution of behavioral modernity and this diverse flora . Here we present the first such record for climate and environmental change from 90 000 to 53 000 year ago from the southern Cape coast . This important time span cover a burst of expression of several indicator of human behavioral modernity , a well a several key cycle in global climate change . Our research location is ideally placed near the location of several critical archaeological site , near the boundary of the winter and summer rainfall regime , and close to isotopically distinct floral zone . We used isotopic analysis of precisely dated speleothems to document shifting vegetation and rainfall , and show that the presence of winter rain and C3 grass wax and wane in response to Southern Hemisphere shift in SSTs and global temperature . When proxy of global temperature indicate warmer condition , delta ( 18 ) O and delta ( 13 ) C indicate more winter rain and more C3 grass , respectively , and vice versa . This record display abrupt and short-term change previously undocumented . It is often argued that the Cape Floral Region partially owes it high diversity to relative climatic stability . Our record show isotopic variability that at least match that displayed in the Levantine Mediterranean system , so climatic stability may not have characterized the south coast . One short-lived phase of human technological innovation ( the Still Bay ) associated with early evidence for behavioral modernity occurs synchronous with an abrupt environmental perturbation . Early modern human in this region confronted a variable climate and adapted quickly in a manner similar to behaviorally modern human . ( C ) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVWe used boreal winter output from an IPCC AR4 GCM simulation to drive an atmospheric tracer transport model with water vapor last saturation tracer over the northern hemisphere in order to identify process that contribute to the projected increase in specific humidity of the subtropical relative humidity minimum . Most of the increase in specific humidity at the relative humidity minimum can be attributed to last saturation within what will be a warmer free troposphere . The water vapor content of the relative humidity minimum is projected to increase in the 21st century primarily a a function of increased last saturation temperature in the tropical lower troposphere , effectively yielding more water vapor via poleward transport . The increase in specific humidity is to a degree kept in check by a poleward and upward shift of baroclinic instability and saturation pattern that effectively yield drier air to the RH minimum via isentropic transport .

aVThe Benguela Current Ecosystem of Southern Africa is the strongest wind-driven coastal upwelling system known . This is one of the most productive ocean area in the world , extremely rich in fishery resource with a total catch in excess of one million ton per annum . Marine life off the coast relies heavily on the nutrient-rich upwellings of the cold Benguela current . Warming event occur along this coast in association with many El Nios . These tremendously disrupt the coastal ecosystem , reducing productivity and devastating the anchovy and sardine fishery . This article demonstrates for the first time the existence of a low-level atmospheric jet along the Benguela Coast of the southeastern Atlantic . Blowing parallel to the coast , this jet drive the coastal upwelling system and is part of a mechanism that link Pacific El Nio event to Southern Africa . The existence of such a jet ha tremendous implication for the Benguela current and it response to climatic variability and change because a positive feedback exists between the intensity of this jet and the intensity of coastal upwelling . This may enhance the response of the Benguela Current Ecosystem to climatic variability , making it particularly susceptible to the impact of global climate change .

aVP > Phototrophic microorganism are critical to the carbon cycling and productivity of biological soil crust , which enhance water content , nutrient relation and mechanical stability of arid soil . Only oxygen-producing phototrophs , including cyanobacteria and algae , are known from soil crust , but Earth 's second major branch of photosynthetic organism , the evolutionarily earlier anoxygenic phototrophs , is unreported . We announce the discovery of aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs in three Canadian soil crust community . We found in a culture-based study that they comprised 0.1-5.9 % of the cultivable bacterial community in moss- , lichen- and cyanobacteria-dominated crust from sand dune and sandy soil . Comparable in density to aerobic phototrophs in other habitat , the bacteriochlorophyll a-possessing pink and orange isolates were related to specie of Methylobacterium ( 99.0-99.5 % ) , Belnapia ( 97.4-98.8 % ) , Muricoccus ( 94.4 % ) and Sphingomonas ( 96.6-98.5 % ) , based on 16S rRNA gene sequence . Our result demonstrate that proteobacterial anoxygenic phototrophs may be found in dry soil environment , implying desiccation resistance a yet unreported for this group . By utilizing sunlight for part of their energy need , aerobic phototrophs can accelerate organic carbon cycling in nutrient-poor arid soil . Their effect will be especially important a global climate change enhances soil erosion and consequent nutrient loss .

aVOxyaenid creodonts are extinct carnivorous mammal known from the Paleogene of North America , Europe , and Asia . The genus Palaeonictis is represented by three specie that together span the late Paleocene to early Eocene of North America , and at least one specie from the early Eocene of Europe . Previously , only a single trigonid of Palaeonictis wa known from the interval encompassing the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum ( PETM ) in North America . We describe Palaeonictis wingi sp . nov. from the PETM in the Cabin Fork drainage , southeastern Bighorn Basin , Wyoming , based on associated right and left dentaries with P ( 2 ) -M ( 2 ) . Palaeonictis wingi sp . nov. is substantially smaller than the other North American congener , making it similar in size to P. gigantea from the earliest Eocene of Europe and the previously described PETM specimen . We suggest that a form similar to the large-bodied late Paleocene P. peloria from North America gave rise to two smaller specie in the earliest Eocene of North America ( P. wingi ) and Europe ( P. gigantea ) . Palaeonictis wingi may have given rise to P. occidentalis following the PETM in North America . Dispersal of Palaeonictis to Europe coincided with rapid global warming of 5-10A degree C and related geographic range shift in plant and other animal during the PETM . It ha been suggested that certain mammalian lineage decreased in body size during the PETM , possibly in response to elevated temperature and/or higher CO ( 2 ) level . Results from a dietary analysis of Palaeonictis indicate that it wa an omnivore that primarily consumed meat . This suggests that the decreased nutritious quality of vegetation caused by increased CO ( 2 ) level wa not the direct contributing factor that caused body size reduction of this lineage during the PETM . Other selective pressure such a temperature , aridity , and prey size may have also contributed to the smaller body size of carnivorous mammal during this interval , although the presence of smaller specie could also be explained by latitudinal range shift of mammal during the PETM .

aVThis paper describes a methodology developed for designing an optimal configuration for system transmission planning with carbon emission cost . The power transmission network planning problem is modeled by the mixed integer programming model , a GA , and SA . At this moment environmental issue have the most serious problem to be concerned within every part of the world . Global warming , which is mainly caused by the emission of Green House Gases ( GHGs ) , is said to be a serious part of these environmental problem . Since green house gas issue become important and the new legislation are taken into account , carbon emission cost are included in the total cost of the transmission network planning . This method of solution is demonstrated on the real problem . Finally , the genetic algorithm show to be a very good option for network planning system given that it obtains much accentuated reduction of iteration , which is very important for network planning .

aVThe widespread use of solar-reflective roofing material can save energy , mitigate urban heat island and slow global warming by cooling the roughly 20 % of the urban surface that is roofed . In this study we created prototype solar-reflective nonwhite concrete tile and asphalt shingle roofing material using a two-layer spray coating process intended to maximize both solar reflectance and factory-line throughput . Each layer is a thin , quick-drying , pigmented latex paint based on either acrylic or a poly ( vinylidene fluoride ) /acrylic blend . The first layer is a titanium dioxide rutile white basecoat that increase the solar reflectance of a gray-cement concrete tile from 0.18 to 0.79 , and that of a shingle surfaced with bare granule from 0.06 to 0.62 . The second layer is a `` cool '' color topcoat with weak near-infrared ( NIR ) absorption and/or strong NIR backscattering . Each layer dry within second , potentially allowing a factory line to pas first under the white spray , then under the color spray . We combined a white basecoat with monocolor topcoat in various shade of red , brown , green and blue to prepare 24 cool colored prototype tile and 24 cool colored prototype shingle . The solar reflectance of the tile ranged from 0.26 ( dark brown ; CIELAB lightness value L*=29 ) to 0.57 ( light green ; L*=76 ) ; those of the shingle ranged from 0.18 ( dark brown ; L*=26 ) to 0.34 ( light green ; L*=68 ) . Over half of the tile had a solar reflectance of at least 0.40 , and over half of the shingle had a solar reflectance of at least 0.25 . ( C ) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All right reserved .

aVLate Quaternary temperature estimate from the mid latitude of the Australian region suggest a breakdown in the tight coupling observed between oceanic and atmospheric temperature over the recent past that ha significant implication for our understanding of the response of the Earth 's climate system to global climate change and orbital forcing . Here , we present a pollen-based quantitative temperature reconstruction from the mid latitude of Australia that span the last 135 000 year , enabling u to address this critical issue . Gradient analysis of a pollen dataset inclusive of over 1100 Quaternary and modern pollen spectrum demonstrates the dominant influence of temperature over Quaternary pollen composition and vegetation change in western Tasmania , Australia . We develop and apply a transfer function for average annual temperature that performs excellently under cross-validation ( r ( 2 ) = 0.76 ; RMSEP 1 degree C ) , is not influenced by spatial autocorrelation and that reveals a remarkably close correlation between oceanic and atmospheric temperature change over the last 135 000 year . Significantly , we report a substantially lower degree of cooling during the LGM/MIS 2 ( 3.7-4.2 degree C below present ) than previously estimated ; a similar degree of cooling during MIS 4 a the LGM ( ca 4 degree C ) ; and a 1 C warming during the last Interglacial relative to today . We conclude that atmospheric and oceanic temperature change in this region have remained coupled throughout the substantial climatic shift associated with glacial interglacial cycle over the last 135 000 year . Western Tasmanian pollen record have great potential a a Southern Hemisphere terrestrial palaeothermometer and are critically located to provide significant input in to debate over the occurrence and influence of regional and global climatic episode in the Southern Hemisphere .

aVGeometric property of winter ( DJF ) and summer ( JJA ) midlatitude cyclone are analysed in reanalysis data , present-day and global warming simulation . Cyclone centre are identified by the minimum of the 1000 hPa geopotential height . Fitting an azimuthally symmetric Gaussian function to the surrounding height field provides cyclone depth ( difference between the cyclone centre and the synoptic environment ) , radius ( standard deviation ) , geostrophic wind and vorticity . Analysing ERA-40 reanalysis data of different resolution and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) scenario simulation by the coupled atmosphere ocean general circulation model ECHAM5/MPI-OM yield mean radius of 300-500 km in winter and 300-400 km in summer . Depth maximum occur in the storm track ( determined by the bandpass-filtered variance of the geopotential height ) , and the smallest radius characterize oceanic cyclogenesis region . The geostrophic vorticity , derived from the fitted Gaussian model , agrees reasonably well with the observed relative vorticity . Future warmer climate scenario exhibit smaller radius and weaker depth during winter and summer . An intense growth of the depth is found during the 2-10 day cyclone life cycle , while the radius reveal negligible growth . Compositing depth with respect to normalized total lifetime lead to rescaled depth life cycle , which collapse to a simple universal function , ( a ) over tilde ( 1 - ( a ) over tilde ) , for relative cyclone age ( a ) over tilde .

aVCanada is seeking cost-effective mean to mitigate anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission , particularly CO ( 2 ) , that have been linked to global climate change . In 2003 the Government of Canada launched the Forest 2020 Plantation Development and Assessment Initiative to ass the potential for fast-growing woody crop to sequester carbon from the atmosphere . Across the country 6000 ha of plantation were established and monitored on nonforested land ( afforestation ) using a variety of method . Economic analysis assessed the investment attractiveness of this mitigation measure for a range of specie and suitable land , taking into account such factor a growth rate , agricultural opportunity cost and a range of possible carbon value . Analyses illustrated that at current trading price for carbon and for much of the available land and expanding market for forest bioproducts , expected rate of return on investment for afforestation were relatively low . However , higher future carbon price , combined with monetary value for environmental benefit , could dramatically change the economics of afforestation in the future .

aVStratified interface are present in many geophysical flow situation , and transport across such an interface is an essential factor for correctly evaluating the physical process taking place at many spatial and temporal scale in such flow . In order to accurately evaluate vertical and lateral transport occurring when a turbulent flow impinges on a stratified interface , the turbulent entrainment and vorticity generation mechanism near the interface must be understood and quantified . Laboratory experiment were performed for three flow configuration : a vertical thermal , a sloping gravity current and a vertical turbulent jet with various tilt angle and precession speed . All three flow impinged on an interface separating a two-layer stably stratified environment . The entrainment rate is quantified for each flow using laser-induced fluorescence and compared to prediction of Cotel and Breidenthal ( 1997 Appl . Sci . Res . 57 349-66 ) . The possible application of transport across stratified interface include the contribution of hydrothermal plume to the global ocean energy budget , turbidity current on the ocean floor , the design of lake de-stratification system , modeling gas leak from storage reservoir , weather forecasting and global climate change .

aVDue to global warming , the need to secure an alternative resource ha become more important nationally . With the high tidal range of up to 9.7 m on the west coast of Korea , numerous tidal current project are being planned and constructed . To extract a significant quantity of power , a tidal current farm with a multi-arrangement is necessary in the ocean . The rotor , which initially convert the energy , is a very important component because it affect the efficiency of the entire system , and it performance is determined by various design variable . The power generation is strongly dependent on the size of the rotor and the incoming flow velocity . However , the interaction between device also contribute significantly to the total power capacity . Therefore , rotor performance considering the interaction problem need to be investigated for generating maximum power in a specific field . This paper document a performance study of device considering the interference between rotating rotor with axial , transverse and diagonal arrangement .

aVEnvironmental problem have received a great deal of attention in recent year . In particular , CO ( 2 ) emission worsen global warming and other environmental problem . The transport sector account for 20 % of the total CO ( 2 ) emission . Therefore , the CO ( 2 ) emission reduction of the transport sector is of great importance . In order to reduce emission effectively , it is necessary to change the distribution and transportation process . The purpose of this study is to minimize both the transportation cost and CO ( 2 ) emission during transportation . Our model considers a transportation scheduling problem in which load are transported from an overseas production base to three domestic demand center . The need for time-space network arises naturally to improve the model . It is possible to know the distance carrier are moving , and also consider the timetable of carrier during transportation . Carrier choice , less-than carrier load , and domestic transportation among demand center are considered a the three target area to reduce CO ( 2 ) emission during the distribution process . The research model wa formulated a a mixed integer programming ( MIP ) problem . It achieves cost reduction , and will contribute to improvement of the natural environment .

aVAbsorbing aerosol supplement the global warming caused by greenhouse gas . However , unlike greenhouse gas , the effect of absorbing aerosol on climate is not known with certainty owing to paucity of data . Also , uncertainty exists in quantifying the contributing factor whether it is biomass or fossil fuel burning . Based on the observation of absorption coefficient at seven wavelength and aerosol optical depth ( AOD ) at five wavelength carried out at Gadanki ( 13.5 degree N , 79.2 degree E ) , a remote village in peninsular India , from April to November 2008 , a part of the `` Study of Atmospheric Forcing and Responses ( SAFAR ) '' pilot campaign we discus seasonal variation of black carbon ( BC ) concentration and aerosol optical depth . Also , using spectral information we estimate the fraction of fossil-fuel and non-fossil fuel contribution to absorption coefficient and contribution of soot ( Black Carbon ) , non-soot fine mode aerosol and coarse mode aerosol to AOD . BC concentration is found to be around 1000 ng/m ( 3 ) during monsoon month ( JJAS ) and around 4000 ng/m ( 3 ) during pre and post monsoon month . Non-fossil fuel source contribute nearly 20 % to absorption coefficient at 880 nm , which increase to 40 % during morning and evening hour . Average AOD is found to be 0.38 +/- 0.15 , with high value in May and low in September . Soot contributes nearly 10 % to the AOD . This information is further used to estimate the clear sky aerosol direct radiative forcing . Top of the atmosphere aerosol radiative forcing varies between -4 to 0 W m ( -2 ) , except for April when the forcing is positive . Surface level radiative forcing is between -10 to -20 W m ( -2 ) . The net radiation absorbed within the atmosphere is in the range of 9 to 25 W m ( -2 ) , of which soot contributes about 80 to 90 % .

aVA zigzag city belt along the Yangtze River and Hangzhou rim ha formed in the Yangtze River Delta in China due to the accelerated development of human activity and urbanization . Local climate change in the belt ha affected the spatial pattern of surface air temperature ( SAT ) . ( 1 ) There exist six major warmer center with increasing rate of SAT from 0.28 to 0.54 degree C per decade during 1961-2006 along the belt , namely Yangzhou , Nanjing , Jiangyin , Shanghai , Hangzhou and Ningbo . As the greatest area of human activity and rapid urbanization in the Yangtze River Delta , Shanghai metropolitan area have the maximum rate of increase in annual and seasonal mean SAT , which range from 0.23 to 0.50 degree C per decade , and the strongest urban heat island effect , which are increasing at rate in the range of 0.11-0.15 degree C per decade . ( 2 ) Local warming and urban heat island effect have created the largest and warmest SAT core in the Shanghai metropolitan area , contributing to spatial pattern change in SAT over the Yangtze River Delta . The spatial pattern of SAT for 2001-2006 and 1971-2000 significantly differ in the typical latitudinal pattern for 1971-2000 that ha changed , mainly in Shanghai metropolitan area . ( 3 ) The annual mean of the regional SAT will increase from 15.4 degree C in 1961-1990 to 18.5 degree C in 2071-2100 due to global warming and urban heat island effect according to the IPCC SRES A2 Scenario . This increase is notably higher than the increment of 2.5 degree C from 15.4 degree C to 17.9 degree C due to global warming alone . The spatial distribution of the projected SAT with global warming and urban heat island effect is markedly different from that for global warming alone . In 2071-2100 , the Shanghai metropolitan area will have summer average temperature of about 30.0-30.5 degree C , which are higher than summer average temperature of about 28.7 degree C that would be expected from global warming alone . Higher average temperature can have negative implication for energy and water consumption , human health and local ecosystem . The development and implementation of adaptation strategy are important and required by the policy maker from local government and city planning department . ( C ) 2010 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA .

aVConsiderable research ha been carried out on the optimization of water distribution system ( WDSs ) over the last three decade . In previous research , attention ha mainly focused on the minimization of cost , due to the high expenditure associated with the construction and maintenance of such system . However , the impact of WDSs on the environment usually have not been considered adequately . The recent increasing awareness of sustainability and climate change , especially global warming , ha led to research where greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emission are considered . In the study described in this paper a multiobjective genetic algorithm for WDS optimization ha been used a an explorative tool to investigate the trade-off between the traditional economic objective of minimizing cost and an additional environmental objective of minimizing GHG emission . The impact of minimizing GHG emission on the result of WDS optimization have been explored for a case study in this paper . The result indicate that the inclusion of GHG emission minimization a one of the objective result in significant trade-off between the economic and environmental objective . Furthermore , a sensitivity analysis ha been conducted by using different discount rate in a present value analysis for computing both ongoing cost and GHG emission . The result obtained show that the Pareto-optimal front is very sensitive to the discount rate used . As a result , the selection of discount rate ha a significant impact on final decision making .

aVExtremely large volcanic eruption have been linked to global climate change , biotic turnover , and , for the Younger Toba Tuff ( YTT ) eruption 74,000 year ago , near-extinction of modern human . One of the largest uncertainty of the climate effect involves evolution and growth of aerosol particle . A huge atmospheric concentration of sulfate cause higher collision rate , larger particle size , and rapid fall out , which in turn greatly affect radiative feedback . We address this key process by incorporating the effect of aerosol microphysical process into an Earth System Model . The temperature response is shorter ( 9-10 year ) and three time weaker ( -3.5 K at maximum globally ) than estimated before , although cooling could still have reached -12 K in some midlatitude continental region after one year . The smaller response , plus it geographic patchiness , suggests that most biota may have escaped threshold extinction pressure from the eruption . Citation : Timmreck , C. , H.-F. Graf , S. J.

aVA statistical intensity adjustment is utilized to extract information from tropical cyclone simulation in a 50 km resolution global model A simple adjustment based on the modeled and observed probability distribution of storm lifetime maximum wind speed allows the model to capture the difference between ob served intensity distribution in active/inactive year composite from the 1981-2008 period in the North Atlantic This intensity adjustment is then used to examine the atmospheric model s response to different sea surface temperature anomaly generated by coupled model for the late twenty first century In the North Atlantic all simulation produce a reduction in the total number of cyclone but with large intermodel spread in the magnitude of the reduction The intensity response is positively correlated with change in frequency across the ensemble However there is on average an increase in intensity in these simulation despite the mean reduction in frequency The author argue that it is useful to decompose these intensity change into two part an increase in intensity that is intrinsic to the climate change experiment and a change in intensity positively correlated with frequency just a in the active/inactive historical composite By isolating the intrinsic component which is relatively independent of the detail of the SST warming pattern an increase is found in storm lifetime maximum wind of 5-10 m s ( -1 ) for storm with intensity of 30-60 m s ( -1 ) by the end of the twenty first century The effect of change in frequency which are dependent on the detail of the spatial structure of the warming must then be superimposed on this intrinsic change

aVPurpose We propose a prescriptive framework to support environmentally conscious decision making in the design of good and service . The framework bridge recent application of input-output analysis to conduct environmental life cycle assessment ( LCA ) , with seminal work in production economics . In the latter , product design , production planning , and scheduling problem are frequently formulated a input-output model with substitution , and subsequently analyzed and solved a linear program . The use of linear programming provides an appealing theory and computational framework to support decision making , a well a to conduct sensitivity analysis Methods In this paper , we explore the benefit of integrating LCA within a linear programming ( LP ) framework and present a case study where we consider a hypothetical advertiser located in the Chicago Metropolitan Area , who wish to allocate a predetermined budget to place ad in either the print or online version of a high-circulation , local newspaper . We formulate the problem of finding an advertising strategy that minimizes global warming potential ( GWP ) , subject to demand and budget constraint . We then solve the problem and evaluate the optimal strategy in term of discharge of component greenhouse gas , and in term of requirement imposed on various energy source . We also analyze the sensitivity of the optimal advertising strategy ( and associated global warming potential ) to perturbation in the model parameter and constraint . Results and discussion By embedding LCA within an LP formulation , we are able to examine the relationship between economic and environmental factor inherent within decision to use specific product or service . Specifically , the advertiser find that each strategy contains tradeoff among and between environmental and monetary cost . A disaggregate comparison of greenhouse gas release and energy consumption among strategy highlight the variation between these factor and the potential danger of aggregation . Sensitivity analysis give u marginal cost ( per dollar and per person ) of GWP in the optimal solution . These and other managerial insight presented highlight the complex tradeoff necessary for environmentally conscious , sustainable decision making .

The impact assessment method of IPCC 2007 GWP 100a and Eco-indicator 99 ( H ) were used to cover the impact category of Global warming potential , Fossil fuel , Ecotoxicity , Minerals , Carcinogens , and Respiratory inorganics . In all category , the slab showed the lowest impact and the hot-dipped galvanized steel showed the highest impact . The main cause of the impact were attributed to these input : steel , energy , and zinc . The emission from steel production plant showed relatively low impact . Small amount of zinc input can cause huge environmental impact . The impact of Fossil fuel , Minerals , and Ecotoxicity , of 1-kg zinc were 2.9 , 116.9 , and 39.6 time of those caused by 1-kg cold-rolled steel , respectively . The reduction of zinc consumption and the improvement of zinc production process , in term of reduction of heavy metal emission , could largely improve environmental performance of the galvanized steel .

aVGlobal warming is one of the principal challenge facing insect worldwide . It affect individual specie and interaction between specie directly through effect on their physiology and indirectly through effect on their habitat . Aphids are particularly sensitive to temperature change due to certain specific biological feature of this group . Effects on individual have repercussion for aphid diversity and population dynamic . At a pan-European scale , the EXAMINE observation network ha provided evidence for an increase in the number of aphid specie present over the last 30 year and for earlier spring flight . We review these result and provide a review of the principal effect of global warming on aphid community . ( C ) 2010 Academie de science . Published by Elsevier Masson SAS . All right reserved .

aVOropouche ( OROV ) is a single-stranded RNA arbovirus of the family Bunyaviridae , genus Orthobunyavirus , which ha caused over half a million case of febrile illness in Brazil in the past 30 year . OROV fever ha been registered almost exclusively in the Amazon region , but global warming , deforestation and redistribution of vector and animal reservoir increase the risk of Oropouche virus emergence in other area . OROV cause a cytolytical infection in cultured cell with characteristic cytopathic effect 48 h post-infection . We have studied the mechanism of apoptosis induced by OROV in HeLa cell and found that OROV cause DNA fragmentation detectable by gel electrophoresis and by flow cytometric analysis of the Sub-G1 population at 36 h post-infection . Mitochondrial release of cytochrome C and activation of caspase 9 and 3 were also detected by western blot analysis . Lack of apoptosis induced by UV-inactivated OROV reveals that virus-receptor binding is not sufficient to induce cell death . Results obtained in cell treated with chloroquine and cycloheximide indicated that viral uncoating and replication are required for apoptosis induction by OROV . Furthermore , treatment of the cell with pan-caspase inhibitor prevented OROV-induced apoptosis without affecting virus progeny production . The result show that OROV infection in vitro cause apoptosis by an intracellular pathway involving mitochondrion , and activated by a mechanism dependent on viral replication and protein synthesis .

aVOutbreaks of the Nilaparvata lugens ( stal ) , have occurred frequently in China during the past few year , resulting in a broad and significant reduction in rice yield . N. lugens immigrate into China each spring from Southeast Asia , and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is the first area affected . Light trap catch for the early season period ( March-June ) in Guangxi for the past 30 yr have been analyzed , and the catch sequence for five observation station ( Longzhou , Hepu , Yongning Yongfu , and Quanzhou ) were studied in detail . It wa found that during the past 10 yr the first appearance of N. lugens at light trap occurs earlier , there is a higher frequency of day with large light-trap catch , and catch in southern Guangxi are larger . Recently light-trap catch have also increased in northern Guangxi . It is concluded that the increasing number of immigrant from overseas is one of the primary reason for the increase in N. lugens outbreak in the past 10 yr . Global warming , and specifically winter temperature increase , appears to be for a factor accelerating outbreak of N. lugens in Asia .

aVSolar Radiation Management ( SRM ) Geoengineering may ameliorate many consequence of global warming but also ha the potential to drive regional climate outside the envelope of greenhouse-gas induced warming , creating 'novel ' condition , and could affect precipitation in some region disproportionably . Here , using a fully coupled climate model we explore some new methodology for assessing regional disparity in geoengineering impact . Taking a 4 x CO ( 2 ) climate and an idealized 'sunshade ' SRM strategy , we consider different fraction of the maximum theoretical , 4 x CO ( 2 ) -cancelling global mean cooling . Whilst regional prediction in particularly relatively low resolution global climate model must be treated with caution , our simulation indicate that it might be possible to identify a level of SRM geoengineering capable of meeting multiple target , such a maintaining a stable mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet and cooling global climate , but without reducing global precipitation below pre-industrial or exposing significant fraction of the Earth to 'novel ' climate condition .

aVFrom July to September 2008 , air sample were collected aboard the research expedition icebreaker XueLong ( Snow Dragon ) a part of the 2008 Chinese Arctic Research Expedition Program . Hexachlorocyclohexane ( HCH ) concentration were analyzed in all of the sample . The average concentration ( +/- standard deviation ) over the entire period were 33 +/- 16 , 5.4 +/- 3.0 , and 13 +/- 7.5 pg m ( -3 ) for alpha- , beta- and gamma-HCH , respectively . Compared to previous study in the same area , total HCH ( Sigma HCH , the sum of alpha- , beta- , and gamma-HCH ) level declined by more than 10x compared to those observed in the 1990s , but were approximately 4x higher than those measured by the 2003 China Arctic Research Expedition , suggesting the increase of atmospheric Sigma HCH recently . Because of the continuing use of lindane , ratio of alpha/gamma-HCH showed an obvious decrease in North Pacific and Arctic region compared with those for 2003 Chinese Arctic Research Expedition . In Arctic , the level of alpha-HCH wa found to be linked to sea ice distribution . Geographically , the average concentration of alpha-HCH in air sample from the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas , neither of which contain sea ice , wa 23 +/- 4.4 pg m ( -3 ) , while sample from the area covered by seasonal ice ( similar to 75 degree N to similar to 83 degree N ) , the so-called `` floating sea ice region '' , contained the highest average level of alpha-HCH at 48 +/- 12 pg m ( -3 ) , likely due to emission from sea ice and strong air-sea exchange . The lowest concentration of alpha-HCH were observed in the pack ice region in the high Arctic covered by multiyear sea ice ( similar to 83 degree N to similar to 86 degree N ) . This phenomenon implies that the re-emission of HCH trapped in ice sheet and Arctic Ocean may accelerate during the summer a ice coverage in the Arctic Ocean decrease in response to global climate change .

aVSeeking to limit global warming to 2 degree C put narrow restriction on the remaining carbon budget . While the prevalent accounting framework for carbon emission is production based ( Production-Based Principle , PBP ) , we here quantify the CO ( 2 ) emission on the basis of the Consumption-Based Principle ( CBP ) for Austria . At a methodological level , a Multi-Regional Input-Output model with full linkage is used to account for Austria 's CO ( 2 ) responsibility on a global scale . Estimates are carried out for the year 1997 and 2004 . Results show that during 1997 CO ( 2 ) responsibility based on CBP were 36 % larger than those based on PBP . This relation ha increased through time . The CBP indicator of 2004 wa 44 % larger than the PBP . In term of carbon emission location , for each Euro spent on Austrian final demand in 2004 , it is estimated that two-thirds of the CO ( 2 ) emission occur outside Austrian border . Regarding the origin of the emission embodied in import , it is estimated that about one-fourth originated in non-Annex I country in 1997 . This proportion increased to one-third by 2004 . Due to this divergence between CBP and PBP indicator , there is a need to rethink current accounting base in order to properly assign CO ( 2 ) responsibility . ( C ) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

aVEstuaries along the northern Gulf of Mexico show rapid landward shift in estuarine environment ( back-stepping ) around 8200 cal yr BP . Paleogeographic map of the estuary based on seismic data and core , and constrained chronologically by radiocarbon date , depict bay-head delta retreat in excess of 25 m/yr . During these event the sub-aerial delta plain flooded to create sub-tidal upper- and middle-bay environment . Abrupt sea-level rise associated with the 8200 cal yr BP climate-change event caused these estuary and others around the world to reorganize abruptly . In the northern Gulf of Mexico , the sea-level rise associated with the event wa only similar to 0.1 m over a sub-decadal time period . This rise wa superimposed on a background decelerating rate of sea-level rise of similar to 1.0-0.5 m/century . The widespread bay-head delta back-stepping , documented here , may be an appropriate analog for possible abrupt future climate change in response to global warming . It also show that estuary fringed by low-gradient shoreline are highly sensitive to low-amplitude and sudden sea-level rise . ( C ) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

aVInterest in liquid biofuels production and use ha increased worldwide a part of government policy to address the growing scarcity and riskiness of petroleum use , and , at least in theory , to help mitigate adverse global climate change . The existing biofuels market are dominated by U.S. ethanol production based on cornstarch , Brazilian ethanol production based on sugarcane , and European biodiesel production based on rapeseed oil . Other promising effort have included program to shift toward the production and use of biofuels based on residue and waste material from the agricultural and forestry sector , and perennial grass , such a switchgrass and miscanthus-so-called cellulosic ethanol . This article review these effort and the recent literature in the context of ecological economics and sustainability science . Several common dimension for sustainable biofuels are discussed : scale ( resource assessment , land availability , and land use practice ) ; efficiency ( economic and energy ) ; equity ( geographic distribution of resource and the `` food versus fuel '' debate ) ; socio-economic issue ; and environmental effect and emission . Recent proposal have been made for the development of sustainable biofuels criterion , culminating in standard released in Sweden in 2008 and a draft report from the international Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels . These criterion hold promise for accelerating a shift away from unsustainable biofuels based on grain , such a corn , and toward possible sustainable feedstock and production practice that may be able to meet a variety of social , economic , and environmental sustainability criterion .

aVLarge river of the tropic , many of which have extensive floodplain and delta , are important in the delivery of nutrient and sediment to marine environment , in methane emission to the atmosphere and in providing ecosystem service associated with their high biological productivity . These ecosystem function entail biogeochemical process that will be influenced by climate change . Evidence for recent climate-driven change in tropical river exists , but remains equivocal . Model projection suggest substantial future climate-driven change , but they also underscore the complex interaction that control landscape water balance , river discharge and biogeochemical process . The most important change are likely to involve : ( 1 ) aquatic thermal regime , with implication for thermal optimum of plant and animal , rate of microbially mediated biogeochemical transformation , density stratification of water body and dissolved oxygen depletion ; ( 2 ) hydrological regime of discharge and floodplain inundation , which determine the ecological structure and function of river and floodplain and the extent and seasonality of aquatic environment ; and ( 3 ) freshwater-seawater gradient where river meet ocean , affecting the distribution of marine , brackish and freshwater environment and the biogeochemical processing a river water approach the coastal zone . In all case , climate change affect biogeochemical process in concert with other driver such a deforestation and other land use change , dam and other hydrological alteration and water withdrawal . Furthermore , change in riverine hydrology and biogeochemistry produce potential feedback to climate involving biogeochemical process such a decomposition and methane emission . Future research should seek improved understanding of these change , and long-term monitoring should be extended to shallow water of wetland and floodplain in addition to the larger lake and river that are most studied .

aVSpecies migration in response to warming temperature is expected to lead to 'biotic attrition , ' or loss of local diversity , in area where the number of specie emigrating or going locally extinct exceeds the number immigrating . Biotic attrition is predicted be especially severe in the low-lying hot tropic since elevated temperature may surpass the observed tolerance of most extant specie . It is possible , however , that the estimated temperature niche of many specie are inaccurate and truncated with respect to their true tolerance due to the absence of hotter area under current global climate . If so , these specie will be capable of persisting in some area where future temperature exceed current temperature , reducing rate of biotic attrition . Here , we use natural history collection data to estimate the realized thermal niche of > 2000 plant specie from the tropical forest of South America . In accord with the truncation hypothesis , we find that the thermal niche of specie from hot lowland area are several degree narrower than the thermal niche of specie from cooler area . We estimate rate of biotic attrition for South American tropical forest due to temperature increase ranging from 1 to 5 degree C , and under two niche assumption . The first is that the observed thermal niche truly reflect the plant 's tolerance and that the reduction in niche breadth is due to increased specialization . The second is that lowland specie have the same mean thermal niche breadth a nonlowland and nonequatorial specie . The difference between these two model are dramatic . For example , using observed thermal niche we predict an almost complete loss of plant diversity in most South American tropical forest due to a 5 degree C temperature increase , but correcting for possible niche truncation we estimate that most forest will retain > 50-70 % of their current specie richness . The different prediction highlight the importance of using fundamental vs. realized niche in predicting the response of specie to global climate change .

aVLaboratory experiment were performed to study the capacity of CO ( 2 ) sequestration and carbon fixation into biomass during the cultivation of the cyanobacteria Aphanothece microscopica Nageli in refinery wastewater . The influence of the photoperiod ( day/night ) on the rate of CO ( 2 ) sequestration and O ( 2 ) release wa also determined . Rates of CO ( 2 ) sequestration were measured both in the liquid and gaseous phase . The result showed that the capacity of CO ( 2 ) sequestration and O ( 2 ) release during the day/night experiment wa about one-fourth le than that achieved in the continuously illuminated experiment . Equivalence wa found between rate of CO ( 2 ) sequestration measured in the two phase . Despite large amount of CO2 that were sequestered during the cultivation , it is demonstrated that only a small fraction ( about 3 % ) wa effectively fixed a microalgae biomass , indicating the existence of other route of CO ( 2 ) conversion in the photobioreactor .

aVFor the geological sequestration of carbon dioxide to prevent global warming , the phase equilibrium data for water and carbon dioxide mixture play an important role in process design and operation . In this work , the nonrandom lattice fluid equation of state with hydrogen bonding ( NLF-HB EOS ) wa applied for the prediction of phase equilibrium of mixture containing water and carbon dioxide . A new set of pure component parameter for carbon dioxide above critical condition wa found and optimum binary interaction parameter were reported to correlate mutual solubility of mixture . The calculated result were compared with the Peng-Robinson Equation of State with the conventional mixing rule ( PR-EOS ) and the Wong-Sandler mixing rule ( PR-WS-EOS ) . The calculation result show that NLF-HB EOS can correlate mutual solubility of water+carbon dioxide mixture with reasonable accuracy within a single theoretical framework .

aVCarbon exchange rate ( CER ) and whole-plant carbon balance of beech ( Fagus grandifolia ) and sugar maple ( Acer saccharum ) were compared for seedling grown under low irradiance to determine the effect of atmospheric CO2 enrichment on shade-tolerant seedling of co-dominant specie . Under contemporary atmospheric CO2 , photosynthetic rate per unit mass of beech wa lower than for sugar maple , and atmospheric CO2 enrichment enhanced photosynthesis for beech only . Aboveground respiration per unit mass decreased with CO2 enrichment for both specie while root respiration per unit mass decreased for sugar maple only . Under contemporary atmospheric CO2 , beech had lower C uptake per plant than sugar maple , while C loss per plant to nocturnal aboveground and root respiration were similar for both specie . Under elevated CO2 , C uptake per plant wa similar for both specie , indicating a significant relative increase in whole-seedling CER with CO2 enrich ment for beech but not for sugar maple . Total C loss per plant to aboveground respiration wa decreased for beech only because increase in sugar maple leaf mass counterbalanced a reduction in respiration rate . Carbon loss to root respiration per plant wa not changed by CO2 enrichment for either specie . However , change in maintenance respiration cost and nitrogen level suggest change in tissue composition with elevated CO2 . Beech had a greater net daily C gain with CO2 enrichment than did sugar maple in contrast to a lower one under contemporary CO2 . Elevated CO2 preferentially enhances the net C balance of beech by increasing photosynthesis and reducing respiration cost . In all case , the greatest C lost wa by root , indicating the importance of belowground biomass in net C gain . Relative growth rate estimated from biomass accumulation wa not affected by CO2 enrichment for either specie possibly because of slow growth under low light . This study indicates the importance of direct effect of CO2 enrichment when predicting potential change in specie distribution with global climate change .

aVThe late Paleocene to early Eocene wa one of the warmest interval in Earth 's history . Superimposed on this long-term warming wa an abrupt short-term extreme warm event at or near the Paleocene/Eocene boundary and centered in the higher latitude . This short-term climate warming wa associated with a major benthic foraminiferal extinction and a dramatic 3-4 part per thousand drop in the ocean 's carbon isotopic composition . It ha been suggested that the late Paleocene/early Eocene global warming wa caused by an enhanced greenhouse effect associated with higher level of atmospheric CO2 relative to present level . We present carbon isotopic data from the co-existing paleosols organic matter and carbonate from a terrestrial sequence in the Paris Basin , France that contradict the notion that an increase in atmospheric CO2 level wa the cause of extreme warming for this time interval . Atmospheric pCO ( 2 ) estimate for the Late Paleocene/early Eocene estimated from the terrestrial carbon isotopic record spanning the Paleocene/Eocene transition , are indistinguishable from each other and were generally between 300 and 700 ppm .

aVCesium-137 , radium-226 and lead-210 profile of a 25 cm sediment core give an indication of recent change in land ocean interaction at a polar coastal environment ( Admiralty Bay , King George Island , Antarctica ) . The linear sedimentation accumulation rate at the study site calculated from the unsupported ( 210 ) Pb profile wa 6.7 mm/year from 1965 to 2005 . A 3.5-fold increase in ( 137 ) Cs concentration wa observed in the top layer of this sediment core . This sharp increase seems to indicate a recent redistribution of fallout radionuclides previously deposited on soil , vegetation and snow . These result imply enhanced land ocean interaction at this site likely a a result of climate change . Because our result are based on a single core , additional investigation are needed to confirm our observation . ( C ) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved .

Journal of Coastal Research , SI 64 ( Proceedings of the 11 th International Coastal Symposium ) , 250-254 . Szczecin , Poland , ISSN 0749-0208 . The cosatal zone ha always been the most developed region , with dense population and many city ; also , it is the ecologically-fragile area , which is very sensitive to climate change . In this paper , the climate change in Jiaodong Peninsula , China wa analyzed by the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test , Accumulated Difference Curve and Order Cluster Analysis method , based upon the temperature and precipitation data over the past 50 year . Results obtained showed a number of observation : ( 1 ) The annual mean temperature of Jiaodong Peninsula showed a significant increasing trend , with a distinct abrupt change point detected around 1990 , during the past 5 decade . The warming of Jiaodong Peninsula over the last 50 year wa due mainly to the significant increase of annual minimum temperature . ( 2 ) The annual precipitation exhibited a decreasing trend during the past 5 decade , with an abrupt change detected around 1980 at most station ; there wa an earlier transition point at 1966 , at a few station . The reduction in precipitation , from June to September , wa responsible mainly for the decrease of annual precipitation . ( 3 ) The temperature evolution in Jiaodong Peninsula wa basically consistent with most part of the world , but warmed at a faster rate over the same period ; the decreasing trend of precipitation wa more significant . Within the Peninsula , the southeastern part ha earlier transition point of temperature and precipitation , a well a larger reduction of precipitation than the northwest . This research wa of great importance to understand the climate change and it environmental effect in the coastal zone .

aVThe accelerating rate of change in biodiversity pattern , mediated by ever increasing human pressure and global warming , demand a better understanding of the relationship between the structure of biological community and ecosystem functioning ( BEF ) . Recent investigation suggest that the functional structure of community , i.e . the composition and diversity of functional trait , is the main driver of ecological process . However , the predictive power of BEF research is still low , the integration of all component of functional community structure a predictor is still lacking , and the multifunctionality of ecosystem ( i.e . rate of multiple process ) must be considered . Here , using a multiple-processes framework from grassland biodiversity experiment , we show that functional identity of specie and functional divergence among specie , rather than specie diversity per se , together promote the level of ecosystem multifunctionality with a predictive power of 80 % . Our result suggest that primary productivity and decomposition rate , two key ecosystem process upon which the global carbon cycle depends , are primarily sustained by specialist specie , i.e . those that hold specialized combination of trait and perform particular function . Contrary to study focusing on single ecosystem function and considering specie richness a the sole measure of biodiversity , we found a linear and non-saturating effect of the functional structure of community on ecosystem multifunctionality . Thus , sustaining multiple ecological process would require focusing on trait dominance and on the degree of community specialization , even in species-rich assemblage .

aVSpecies distribution model , linked to climate projection , are widely used in extinction-risk assessment and conservation planning . However , the degree of confidence that we can place on future climate-change projection depends on global climate-model performance and involves uncertainty that need to be assessed rigorously via climate-model evaluation . Performance assessment are important because the choice of climate model influence projection of specie ' range movement and extinction risk . A consensus view from the climate modeling community is that no single climate model is superior in it ability to forecast key climatic feature . Despite this , the advantage of using multi-model ensemble-averaged climate forecast to account for climate-model uncertainty have not been recognized by ecologist . Here we propose a method to use a range of skill and convergence metric to rank commonly used atmosphere-ocean general circulation model ( AOGCMs ) according to their skill in reproducing 20-year observed pattern of regional and global climate of interest , and to ass their consistency with other AOGCMs . By eliminating poorly performing model and averaging the remainder with equal weight , we show how downscaled annual multi-climate-model ensemble-averaged forecast , which have a strong regional focus , can be generated . We demonstrate that : ( 1 ) model ranking ( match of simulated to observed condition ) differs according to the skill metric used , a well a the climate variable and season considered ; ( 2 ) although the multi-model averaged result tends to outperform single model at a global scale , at the continental scale at least some model can perform better than the multi-model average ; and ( 3 ) forecast for the Australian region , which are often based on a single AOGCM ( CSIRO-3.0 ) , show spatial pattern of change that differ noticeably from ensemble-average projection based on a subset of better-performing AOGCMs . Our suggested approach-novel in the ecology discipline-provides a straightforward , consistent , and defensible method for conservation practitioner and natural-resource manager to generate estimate of future climate change at a spatial resolution suitable for biodiversity impact study .

aVGas-phase Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( FTIR ) ha been used to analyze the effluent from C2H2F4 , hexafluoropropylene oxide ( CF3CFOCF2 , HFPO ) , and CH2F2 pulsed plasma . A series of reference spectrum for possible effluent specie wa used to identify the major specie in each . The major specie in pulsed C2H2F4 plasma were found to be : C2H2F4 , HF , C2F4 , C2HF5 , CHF3 , and SIF , ( formed from free fluorine ) . For HFPO pulsed plasma , the major effluent are : HFPO , CF3COF3 , COF2 , C2F4 , C2F6 , CO , CF4 , and C3F8 , whereas for CH2F2 pulsed plasma , the major effluent are : CH2F2 , HF , SiF4 , and CHF3 . Reaction set were postulated for each precursor to account for the observed effluent , and these set were used to explain the trend of specie concentration with pulse on and pulse off time . In each case , most of the effluent concentration trend could be traced back to competition between dissociation pathway of a particular molecule . For both C2H2F4 and CH2F2 , the main reaction were the competition between CF2 production and I-IF elimination from the original precursor . For C2H2F4 pulsed plasma , the competition between these pathway wa found to be similar to 1:1 , whereas for CH2F2 pulsed plasma , the HF elimination pathway is dominant . For HFPO , the key reaction are the three dissociation pathway of CF3COF , a main product of the initial dissociation of HFPO into CF2+CF3COF . The global warming impact of each of the pulsed plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition process wa gauged by the million metric ton of carbon equivalent ( MMTCE ) metric . CH2F2 pulsed plasma were found to have the lowest MMTCE ( min = 2.1 X 10 ( 6 ) ) , whereas HFPO pulsed plasma had the highest MMTCE ( max = 7.7 X 10 ( 7 ) ) . For all three precursor , the MMTCE impact is reduced by decreasing the exposure to plasma excitation through increasing the off time at a fixed on time . ( C ) 1999 American Vacuum Society .

aVThe ocean is an important sink for carbon and heat , yet high-resolution measurement of biogeochemical property relevant to global climate change are being made only sporadically in the ocean at present . There is a growing need for automated , real-time , long-term measurement of CO2 in the ocean using a network of sensor , strategically placed oh ship , mooring , free-drifting buoy and autonomous remotely operated vehicle . The ground-truthing of new sensor technology is a vital component of present and future effort to monitor change in the ocean carbon cycle and air-sea exchange of CO2 . A comparison of a moored Carbon Interface Ocean Atmosphere ( CARIOCA ) buoy and shipboard fugacity of CO2 ( fCO ( 2 ) ) measurement wa conducted in the western North Atlantic during two extended period ( > I month ) in 1997 . The CARIOCA buoy wa deployed on the Bermuda Testbed Mooring ( BTM ) , which is located 5 km noah of the site of the US Joint Global Ocean Flux Study ( JGOFS ) Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study ( BATS ) . The high frequency of sampling revealed that temperature and fCO ( 2 ) responded to physical forcing by the atmosphere on timescales from diurnal to 4-8 day . Concurrent with the deployment of the CARIOCA buoy , frequent measurement of surface fCO ( 2 ) were made from the R/V Weatherbird II during opportunistic visit to the BTM and BATS site , providing a direct calibration of the CARIOCA buoy fCO ( 2 ) data . Although , the in situ ground-truthing of the CARIOCA buoy wa complicated by diurnal process , sub-mesoscale and fine-scale variability , the CARIOCA buoy fCO ( 2 ) data wa accurate within 3+/-6 mu atm of shipboard fCO ( 2 ) data for period up to 50 day . Longer-term assessment were not possible due to the CARIOCA buoy breaking free of the BTM and drifting into water with different fCO ( 2 ) -temperature property . Strategies are put forward for future calibration of other in situ sensor . ( C ) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All right reserved .

aVThe compound 1,2,2,2-Tetrafluoroethyl Trifluoromethyl Ether , CF3OCHFCF3 ( HFE-227 ) , is currently being considered a a potential replacement for certain halocarbon , particularly for perfluorocarbon ( PFCs ) , a a dry etching gas in the semiconductor industry . For this reason , it is important to determine the potential environmental effect resulting from the use and emission of this compound . In this paper , the atmospheric lifetime , radiative forcing , and Global Warming Potentials ( GWPs ) , an important measure of the potential effect of a gas on climate , are evaluated for this compound using our zonally averaged chemical transport and radiative transfer model of the atmosphere . To our knowledge , this is the first time this compound ha been evaluated with such atmospheric model . In order to calculate the lifetime and radiative forcing , the rate constant and infrared cross section of this compound were measured in laboratory at Illinois and Purdue , and result are reported here . The model-evaluated atmospheric lifetime is 11.3 year , mainly due to reaction with OH radical . The model-evaluated instantaneous-clear-sky radiative forcing is 0.38 W m ( -2 ) ppbv ( -1 ) , about 45 % lower than previously estimated [ Imasu et al. , 1995 ] . However , the model-estimated cloudy-sky adjusted forcing , needed to calculated GWPs , is about 25 % lower than the model-estimated instantaneous-clear-sky forcing . The GWPs are calculated to be 3400 , 1200 , and 370 for 20 , 100 , and 500 year time horizon , respectively .

aVThe application of nitrogen fertiliser lead to different ecological problem such a nitrate leaching and the release of nitrogenous gas . N2O is a gas involved in global warming , therefore , agricultural soil can be regarded a a source of global warming . Soil N2O production come from both the nitrification and denitrification process . From an ecological viewpoint , using nitrification inhibitor with ammonium based fertiliser may be a potential management strategy to lower the flux of N2O , thus decreasing it undesirable effect . In this study , the nitrification inhibitor ( NIs ) dicyandiamide ( DCD ) and 3,4-dimethyl pyrazole phosphate ( DMPP ) have been evaluated a management tool to mitigate N2O emission from mineral fertilisation and slurry application in grassland system ( experiment 1 and 2 ) , and to ass the phytotoxic effect of these inhibitor per se on clover ( experiment 3 ) , Both nitrification inhibitor acted in maintaining soil nitrogen ( N ) in ammonium form , decreasing cumulative N2O emission . DCD , but not DMPP , produced phytotoxic effect and yield reduction in white clover . A nutrient imbalance , which led to a senescence process visually observed a chlorosis and necrosis at the border of the leaf , wa noted .

aVGlobal climate and atmospheric change may interact in their effect on the diversity and composition of natural community . We followed response of an annual grassland to three year of all possible combination of experimentally elevated CO ( 2 ) ( +300 , muL/L ) , warming ( +80 W/m ( 2 ) , + similar to1degreesC ) , nitrogen deposition ( +7 g N.m ( -2 ) .yr ( -1 ) ) , and precipitation ( +50 % ) . Responses of the 10 most common plant specie to global change and to interannual variability were weak but sufficiently consistent within functional group to drive clearer response at the functional group level . The dominant functional group ( annual grass and forbs ) showed distinct production and abundance response to individual global change . After three year , N deposition suppressed plant diversity , forb production , and forb abundance in association with enhanced grass production . Elevated precipitation enhanced plant diversity , forb production , and forb abundance but affected grass little . Warming increased forb production and abundance but did not strongly affect diversity or grass response . Elevated CO ( 2 ) reduced diversity with little effect on relative abundance or production of forbs and grass . Realistic combination of global change had small diversity effect but more marked effect on the relative dominance of forbs and grass . The largest change in relative functional group abundance ( +50 % forbs ) occurred under the combination of elevated CO ( 2 ) + warming + precipitation , which will likely affect much of California in the future . Strong interannual variability in diversity , individual . specie abundance , and functional group abundance indicated that in our system , ( 1 ) response after three year were not constrained by lag in community response , ( 2 ) individual specie were more sensitive to interannual variability and extreme than to mean change in environmental and resource condition , and ( 3 ) simulated global change interacted with interannual variability to produce response of varying magnitude and even direction among year . Relative abundance of forbs , the most speciose group in the community , ranged after three year from > 30 % under elevated CO ( 2 ) + warming + precipitation to < 12 % under N deposition : While opposing production response at the ecosystem level by different functional group may buffet response such a net primary production ( NPP ) change , these shift in relative dominance could influence ecosystem process such a nutrient cycling and , NPP via difference between grass and forbs in tissue chemistry , allocation , phenology , and productivity .

aVWe compared the Q ( 10 ) relationship for root-derived respiration ( including respiration due to the root , external mycorrhizal mycelium and rhizosphere microorganism ) with that of mainly external ectomycorrhizal mycelium and that of bulk soil microorganism without any root present . This wa studied in a microcosm consisting of an ectomycorrhizal Pinus muricata seedling growing in a sandy soil , and where root were allow to colonize one soil compartment , mycorrhizal mycelium another compartment , and the last compartment consisted of root- and mycorrhiza-free soil . The respiration rate in the bulk soil compartment wa 30 time lower than in the root compartment , while that in the mycorrhizal compartment wa six time lower . There were no difference in Q ( 10 ) ( for 5-15degreesC ) between the different compartment , indicating that there were no difference in the temperature relationship between root-associated and non-root-associated organism . Thus , there are no indication that different Q ( 10 ) value should be used for different soil organism , bulk soil or rhizosphere-associated microorganism when modelling the effect of global climate change .

aVAfter four growing season , soil below white oak tree exposed to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide level ( ambient + 300 ppm ) had an average of 14 % more soil carbon than soil below tree exposed to ambient level of carbon dioxide . The soil carbon inventory in five soil core collected from ambient chamber and six soil core collected from elevated chamber at the Global Change Field Research Site , Oak Ridge , Tennessee , were measured . The author conclude that the increase in soil carbon wa due to an increase in belowground soil carbon input , because aboveground litter input were excluded by experimental design . These finding are consistent with the hypothesis that elevated carbon dioxide level are increasing the amount of carbon stored in soil .

aVThe use of a more physically based parametrisation scheme for sub-grid scale ocean mixing produce a more spatially uniform surface warming in the Southern Hemisphere in transient global warming simulation of the CCCma climate model than when an older scheme is used . Here we examine the effect of this different warming pattern on the tropospheric circulation response , by comparing simulation of two version of the model implementing these two mixing parametrisations . It is found that use of either scheme produce a southward shift of the midlatitude jet , but that this shift is considerably smaller when the new parametrisation is implemented . These result suggest that the magnitude of the Southern Annular Mode-like response noted in some global warming simulation may be sensitive to the representation of ocean process .

aVChemical looping combustion ( CLC ) currently is an attractive option to decrease the greenhouse gas emission that affect global warming , because it is a combustion process with inherent CO2 separation and with low energy loss . The CLC concept is based on the transfer of oxygen from the combustion air to fuel by mean of an oxygen carrier in the form of a metal oxide . The system consists of two separate but interconnected reactor , normally fluidized-bed type . In the fuel reactor , the oxygen carrier particle react with fuel and generate a gas stream mainly composed of CO2 and H2O . The reduced metal oxide is later transported to the air reactor , where oxygen from the air is transferred to the particle ; in this way , one can obtain the original metal oxide ready to be returned to the fuel reactor for a new cycle . In this work , a 10 kW ( th ) pilot plant that is composed of two interconnected bubbling fluidized-bed reactor ha been designed and built to demonstrate the CLC technology . The prototype wa operated for 200 h , 120 h of which involved the burning of methane . The effect of the operating condition ( oxygen carrier-to-fuel ratio , fuel gas velocity , oxygen carrier particle size , and fuel reactor temperature ) on fuel conversion wa analyzed working with a CuO-Al2O3 oxygen carrier prepared by dry impregnation . In addition , the behavior with respect to attrition , agglomeration , and reactivity of the oxygen carrier wa analyzed . It wa found that the most important parameter that wa affecting the CH4 conversion wa the oxygen carrier-to-fuel ratio . Complete methane conversion , without CO or H-2 emission , wa obtained with this oxygen carrier working at 800 degree C and oxygen carrier-to-fuel ratio of > 1.4 .

aVFuture warming is predicted to shift the Earth system into a mode with progressive increase and vigour of extreme climate event possibly stimulating other mechanism that invigorate global warming . This study provides new data and modelling investigating climatic consequence and biogeochemical feedback that happened in a warmer world similar to 112 Myr ago . Our study focus on the Cretaceous Oceanic Anoxic Event ( OAE ) lb and explores how the Earth system responded to a moderate similar to 25,000 yr lasting climate perturbation that is modelled to be le than 1 degree C in global average temperature . Using a new chronological model for OAE lb we present high-resolution elemental and bulk carbon isotope record from DSDP Site 545 from Mazagan Plateau off NW Africa and combine this information with a coupled atmosphere-land-ocean model . The simulation suggest that a perturbation at the onset of OAE lb caused almost instantaneous warming of the atmosphere on the order of 0.3 degree C followed by a longer ( similar to 45,000 yr ) period of similar to 0.8 degree C cooling . The marine record from DSDP Site 545 support that these moderate swing in global climate had immediate consequence for African continental supply of mineral matter and nutrient ( phosphorous ) , subsequent oxygen availability , and organic carbon burial in the eastern subtropical Atlantic , however , without turning the ocean anoxic . The match between modelling result and stratigraphic isotopic data support previous study [ summarized in Jenkyns , H.C. , 2003 . Evidence for rapid climate change in the Mesozoic-Palaeogene greenhouse world . The Royal Society , 361 : 1885-1916 . ] in that methane emission from marine hydrate , albeit moderate in dimension , may have been the trigger for OAE 1b , though we can not finally rule out alternative mechanism . Following the hydrate mechanism a total of 1.15-10 ( 18 ) g methane carbon ( delta C-13 = - 60 part per thousand ) , equivalent to about 10 % to the total modem gas hydrate inventory , generated the delta C-13 ( carb ) profile recorded in the section . Modelling suggests a combination of moderate-scale methane pulse supplemented by continuous methane emission at elevated level over similar to 25,000 yr . The proposed mechanism , though difficult to finally confirm in the geological past , is arguably more likely to occur in a warmer world and apparently perturbs global climate and ocean chemistry almost instantaneously . This study show that , once set-off , this mechanism can maintain Earth 's climate in a perturbed mode over geological time leading to pronounced change in regional climate . ( c ) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

aVA major factor in global warming is CO ( 2 ) emission from thermal power plant , which burn fossil fuel . One technology proposed to prevent global warming is CO ( 2 ) recovery from combustion flue gas and the sequestration Of CO ( 2 ) underground or near the ocean bed . Solid oxide fuel cell ( SOFC ) can produce highly concentrated CO ( 2 ) , because the reformed fuel gas reacts with oxygen electrochemically without being mixed with air in the SOFC . We therefore propose to operate multi-staged SOFCs with high utilization of reformed fuel to obtain highly concentrated CO ( 2 ) . In this study , we estimated the performance of multi-staged SOFCs considering H ( 2 ) diffusion and the combined cycle efficiency of a multi-staged SOFC/gas turbine/CO ( 2 ) recovery power plant . The power generation efficiency of our CO ( 2 ) recovery combined cycle is 68.5 % , whereas the efficiency of a conventional SOFC/GT cycle with the CO ( 2 ) recovery amine process is 57.8 % .

aVCurrent trend of global climate change affect marine ectothermal animal not only through the increase in ambient temperature . Synergistic effect of carbon dioxide and temperature change a well a more frequent hypoxia event must also be considered . As a first attempt , the combined effect of warming and elevated CO ( 2 ) concentration were investigated in the edible crab ( Cancer pagurivs ) . Arterial oxygen tension ( PaO ( 2 ) ) in the haemolymph wa recorded on-line during a progressive warming scenario from 10 to 22 degree C and cooling back to 10 degree C. Hypercapnia ( 1 % CO ( 2 ) ) caused a significant reduction of oxygen partial pressure in the haemolymph a well a a large , 5 degree C downward shift of upper thermal limit of aerobic scope . The present finding are the first to show that hypercapnia cause enhanced sensitivity to heat and thus , a narrowing of the thermal tolerance window of a marine ectotherm . Such interaction of ambient temperature and anthropogenic increase in ambient CO ( 2 ) concentration will need to be considered during future investigation of the effect of climate change on ecosystem .

aVA 3.1 m sediment core wa analyzed for stable carbon isotope composition of organic matter and higher plant leaf wax ( HPLW ) lipid biomarkers to determine Holocene shift in C-3 ( higher high marsh ) and C-4 ( low and/or high marsh ) plant deposition at the Sprague River Salt Marsh , Phippsburg , Maine . The carbon isotope composition of the bulk sediment and the HPLW parallel each other throughout most of the core , suggesting that terrestrial plant are an important source of organic matter to the sediment , and diagenetic alteration of the bulk sediment is minimal . The current salt marsh began to form 2500 cal yr BP . Low and/or high C-4 marsh plant dominated deposition at 2000 cal yr BP , 700 cal yr BP , and for the last 200 cal yr BP . Expansion of higher high marsh C-3 plant occurred at 1300 and 600 cal yr BP . These major vegetation shift result from a combination of change in relative sea-level rise and sediment accumulation rate . Average annual carbon sequestration rate for the last 2500 year approximate 40 g C yr ( -1 ) m ( -2 ) , and are in strong agreement with other value published for the Gulf of Maine . Given that Maine salt marsh cover an area of similar to 79 km , they represent an important component of the terrestrial carbon sink . More detailed isotopic and age record from a network of sediment core at Sprague Marsh are needed to truly evaluate the long term change in salt marsh plant community and the impact of more recent human activity , including global warming , on salt marsh vegetation .

aVHere we report on estimate of the change in stratospheric water vapour ( SWV ) due to methane oxidation based on observational data . Above the tropopause oxidation of methane result in a decrease in it mixing ratio with altitude and this is a major source for SWV . The vertical profile of SWV change from methane oxidation is presented here using satellite observation of the vertical profile of methane . Trends in the SWV are shown to be small in the lower stratosphere , but can reach 0.7 ppbv at 30 km at high latitude over the period 1950-2000 . The radiative forcing for this indirect effect of methane increase over the industrial era is estimated to be slightly weaker than 0.1 Wm ( -2 ) which implies a larger contribution of water vapour to the methane global warming potential than used in recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment . Our estimate considers only chemical change and not SWV of dynamical cause . Importantly , we find substantial difference in the temperature change in the stratosphere for a homogeneous change in SWV and SWV change from methane oxidation . This ha implication for trend analysis of SWV and understanding and attribution of the stratospheric temperature trend .

aVDecrease of carbon dioxide emission is a Serious Subject in the steel industry . Although low reducing agent operation of blast furnace is a primary method in ironmaking , many different way should be taken . Utilization of biomass a a carbon-neutral reducing agent is an attractive one for ironmaking . However , since the calorific value is relatively low a an injection material and the oxygen content derived from the functional group is higher than coal . the direct injection of raw biomass into the blast furnace is not favorable . Optimized carbonization of biomass is proposed to keep high carbon yield and to attain selective oxygen removal by controlling the atmosphere . heating time and temperature condition . In carbonization , it wa clarified that the carbonization of biomass from 300 to 500 degree C in the inert gas atmosphere improves the replacement ratio of coke and the crushability by intentionally changing the biomass composition and structure . It wa estimated that the combustibility of the carbonized biomass became similar to Pulverized coal . The effect of carbonized biomass injection into blast furnace wa estimated with Rist diagram . The injection of biomass carbonized in the optimized condition effectively decrease CO ( 2 ) emission from the ironmaking process .

aVFlowering is a critical stage in plant life cycle , and change might alter process at the specie , community and ecosystem level . Therefore , likely flowering-time response to global change driver are needed for prediction of global change impact on natural and managed ecosystem . Here , the impact of elevated atmospheric CO ( 2 ) concentration ( [ CO ( 2 ) ] ) ( 550 mu mol mol ( -1 ) ) and warming ( +2 degree C ) is reported on flowering time in a native , species-rich , temperate grassland in Tasmania , Australia in both 2004 and 2005 . Elevated [ CO ( 2 ) ] did not affect average time of first flowering in either year , only affecting three out of 23 specie . Warming reduced time to first flowering by an average of 19.1 d in 2004 , acting on most specie , but did not significantly alter flowering time in 2005 , which might be related to the timing of rainfall . Elevated [ CO ( 2 ) ] and warming treatment did not interact on flowering time . These result show elevated [ CO ( 2 ) ] did not alter average flowering time or duration in this grassland ; neither did it alter the response to warming . Therefore , flowering phenology appears insensitive to increasing [ CO ( 2 ) ] in this ecosystem , although the response to warming varies between year but can be strong .

aVThe environmental assessment of human activity is a hot topic presently . It is not only important from the environmental view , but also from the view of efficient utilization of limited natural resource , such a fuel , area , water , phosphorus and other resource . Presently so-called CO ( 2Eq ) -footprints are deduced for food to quantify their environmental impact . The objective of the paper is to develop such footprint for food of animal origin and to show present weakness . On the base of the emission ( carbon dioxide , methane , laughing gas ) during crop production , transportation , storing and processing of feed , animal keeping , enteric loss in animal and during excrement management and under consideration of the global warming potential of the gas ( CO ( 2Eq ) ) CO ( 2 ) -footprints for production of milk , beef , pork , poultry meat and egg are deduced and compared with sonic reference . Apart from food the emission are also calculated on the base of edible protein of animal origin . Finally conclusion for further research need are given . CO ( 2Eq ) -footprints may contribute to the assessment of greenhouse gas emission of food of animal origin , but further factor a utilization of grassland and by-product or conservation of the countryside must be also considered for a complex assessment of various production Systems .

aVThe rate of change of climate codetermines the global warming impact on natural and socioeconomic system and their capability to adapt . Establishing past rate of climate change from temperature proxy data remains difficult given their limited spatiotemporal resolution . In contrast , past greenhouse gas radiative forcing , causing climate to change , is well known from ice core . We compare rate of change of anthropogenic forcing with rate of natural greenhouse gas forcing since the Last Glacial Maximum and of solar and volcanic forcing of the last millennium . The smoothing of atmospheric variation by the enclosure process of air into ice is computed with a firn diffusion and enclosure model . The 20th century increase in CO ( 2 ) and it radiative forcing occurred more than an order of magnitude faster than any sustained change during the past 22,000 year . The average rate of increase in the radiative forcing not just from CO ( 2 ) but from the combination of CO ( 2 ) , CH ( 4 ) , and N ( 2 ) O is larger during the Industrial Era than during any comparable period of at least the past 16,000 year . In addition , the decadal-to-century scale rate of change in anthropogenic forcing is unusually high in the context of the natural forcing variation ( solar and volcano ) of the past millennium . Our analysis implies that global climate change , which is anthropogenic in origin , is progressing at a speed that is unprecedented at least during the last 22,000 year .

aVNearly three decade ago Farquhai . von Caemmerer and Berry published a biochemical model for C ( 3 ) photosynthetic rate ( the FvCB model ) The model predicts net photosynthesis ( A ) a the minimum of the Rubisco-limited rate of CO ( 2 ) assimilation ( A ( c ) ) and the electron transport-limited rate of CO ( 2 ) assimilation ( A ( J ) ) Given u simplicity and the growing availability of the required enzyme kinetic constant , the FvCB model ha been used for a wide range of study , from analysing underlying C ( 3 ) leaf biochemistry to predicting photosynthetic flux of ecosystem in response to global warming However , surprisingly , this model ha seen limited use ill existing crop growth model . Here we highlight the elegance , simplicity , and robustness of this model In the light of some uncertainty with photosynthetic electron transport pathway , a recently extended FvCB model to calculate A ( J ) is summarized Applying the FvCB-type model in crop growth model for predicting leaf photosynthesis requires a stomatal conductance ( g ( s ) ) model to be incorporated , so that inter cellular CO ( 2 ) concentration ( C ( 1 ) ) can be estimated In recent year great emphasis ha been put on the significant drawdown of Rubisco carboxylation-sue CO ( 2 ) concentration ( C ( c ) ) relative to C ( 1 ) To account for this drawdown , mesophyll conductance ( g ( m ) ) for CO ( 2 ) transfer can be added We present an analytical algorithm that incorporates a g ( s ) model and us g ( m ) a a temperature-dependent parameter for calculating A under vat ion environmental scenario . Finally we discus a C ( 4 ) -equivalent version of the FvCB model In addition to the algorithm already elaborated for C ( 3 ) photosynthesis , most important algorithm for C ( 4 ) photosynthesis are those that capture the CO ( 2 ) concentrating mechanism and the extra ATP requirement by the C ( 4 ) cycle Although the cui rent estimation of the C ( 4 ) enzyme kinetic constant is le certain , applying FvCB-type model to both C ( 3 ) and C ( 4 ) crop is recommended to accurately predict the response of crop photosynthesis to multiple , interactive environmental variable ( C ) Published by Elsevier B V on behalf of Royal Netherlands Society for Agricultural Sciences

aVThe European Union ( EU ) legislation 2006/40/EC ban from January 2011 the cooperative marketing of new car type that use refrigerant in their heating , ventilation , and air conditioning ( HVAC ) system with global warming potential ( GWP ) higher than 150 Thus , the phase-out of the presently used tetrafluoroethane refrigerant R134a necessitates the adoption of alternative refrigerant . Fluoropropenes such a 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-1-propene ( HFO-1234yf ) are currently regarded a promising low GWP refrigerant , but the lack of experimental data on their thermophysical property hamper independent study on their performance in HVAC system or in other technical application In principle , molecular modeling can be used to predict the relevant property of refrigerant , but adequate intermolecular potential function ( `` force field '' ) arc lacking for fluoropropenes . Thus , we developed a transferable force field for fluoropropenes composed of CF ( 3 ) ( - ) , -CF= , -CH= , CF ( 2 ) = , and CH ( 2 ) = group and applied the force field to study 3,3,3 trifluoro-1-propene ( HFO-1243zf ) , 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-1-propene ( HFO-1234yf ) , and hexafluoro-1-propene ( HFO-1216 ) We performed Gibbs ensemble simulation on these three fluoropropenes to compute the vapor pressure , saturated density , and heat of vaporization . In addition , molecular dynamic simulation were conducted to provide prediction for the density , thermal expansivity , isobaric heat capacity , and transport property of liquid HFO-1234yf in the temperature range from 263.15 to 310 K and pressure up to 2 MPa . Agreement between simulation result and experimental data and/or correlation ( when available ) wa good , thereby validating the predictive ability of the force field

aVGlaciers are one of the most important land cover in alpine region and especially sensitive to global climate change . Remote sensing ha proved to be the best method of investigating the extent of glacial variation in remote mountainous area . Using Landsat thematic mapping ( TM ) and multi-spectral-scanner ( MSS ) image from Mt . Qomolangma ( Everest ) National Nature Preserve ( QNNP ) , central high Himalayas for 1976 , 1988 and 2006 , we derived glacial extent for these three period . A combination of object-oriented image interpretation method , expert knowledge rule and field survey were employed . Results showed that ( 1 ) the glacial area in 2006 wa 2710.17 +/- 0.011 km ( 2 ) ( about 7.41 % of the whole study area ) , and located mainly to the south and between 4700 m to 6800 m above sea level ; ( 2 ) from 1976 to 2006 , glacier reduced by 501.91 +/- 0.035 km ( 2 ) and glacial lake expanded by 36.88 +/- 0.035 km ( 2 ) ; the rate of glacier retreat wa higher in sub-basins on the southern slope ( 16.79 % ) of the Himalayas than on the northern slope ( 14.40 % ) ; most glacier retreated , and mainly occurred at an elevation of 4700-6400 m , and the estimated upper limit of the retreat zone is between 6600 m and 6700 m ; ( 3 ) increase in temperature and decrease in precipitation over the study period are the key factor driving retreat .

aVRate constant for the gas phase reaction of OH radical with two isomer of tetrafluoropropene , CH ( 2 ) =CF-CF ( 3 ) ( k ( 1 ) ) and trans-CHF=CH-CF ( 3 ) ( k ( 2 ) ) ; were measured using a flash photolysis resonance-fluorescence technique over the temperature range 220 to 370 K. The Arrhenius plot were found to exhibit a noticeable curvature . The temperature dependence of the rate constant are very weak and can be represented by the following expression over the indicated temperature interval : k ( 1 ) ( 220-298 K ) = 1.45 x 10 ( -12 ) x exp\u005c { 13/T\u005c } cm ( 3 ) molecule ( -1 ) s ( -1 ) k ( 1 ) ( 298-370 K ) = 4.06 x 10 ( -13 ) x ( T/298 ) ( 1.17 ) x exp\u005c { +296/T\u005c } cm ( 3 ) molecule ( -1 ) s ( -1 ) k ( 2 ) ( 220-370 K ) = 1.115 x 10 ( -13 ) x ( T/298 ) ( 2.03 ) x exp\u005c { +552/T\u005c } cm ( 3 ) molecule ( -1 ) s ( -1 ) The overall accuracy of the rate constant measurement is estimated to be ca . 2 % to 2.5 % at the 95 % confidence level . The uncertainty of the measured reaction rate constant is discussed in detail . The atmospheric lifetime due to reaction with tropospheric OH were estimated to be 12 and 19 day respectively under the assumption of a well mixed atmosphere . IR absorption cross-sections were measured for both compound and their global warming potential were estimated .

aVA laser flash photolysis-resonance fluorescence technique ha been employed to measure rate coefficient and physical vs. reactive quenching branching ratio for O ( 1D ) deactivation by three potent greenhouse gas , SO ( 2 ) F ( 2 ) ( k ( 1 ) ) , NF ( 3 ) ( k ( 2 ) ) , and SF ( 5 ) CF ( 3 ) ( k ( 3 ) ) . In excellent agreement with one published study , we find that k ( 1 ) ( T ) = 9.0 x 10 ( -11 ) exp ( +98/T ) cm ( 3 ) molecule ( -1 ) s ( -1 ) and that the reactive quenching rate coefficient is k ( 1b ) ( 5.8 +/- 2.3 ) x 10 ( -11 ) cm ( 3 ) molecule ( -1 ) s ( -1 ) independent of temperature . We find that k ( 2 ) ( T ) = 2.0 x 10 ( -11 ) exp ( +52/T ) cm ( 3 ) molecule ( -1 ) s ( -1 ) with reaction proceeding almost entirely ( similar to 99 % ) by reactive quenching . Reactive quenching of O ( ( 1 ) D ) by NF ( 3 ) is more than a factor of two faster than reported in one published study , a result that will significantly lower the model-derived atmospheric lifetime and global warming potential of NF ( 3 ) . Deactivation of O ( ( 1 ) D ) by SF ( 5 ) CF ( 3 ) is slow enough ( k ( 3 ) < 2.0 x 10 ( -13 ) cm ( 3 ) molecule ( -1 ) s ( -1 ) at 298 K ) that reaction with O ( ( 1 ) D ) is unimportant a an atmospheric removal mechanism for SF ( 5 ) CF ( 3 ) . The kinetics of O ( ( 1 ) D ) reaction with SO ( 2 ) ( k ( 4 ) ) and CS ( 2 ) ( k ( 5 ) ) have also been investigated at 298 K. We find that k ( 4 ) = ( 2.2 +/- 0.3 ) x 10 ( -10 ) and k ( 5 ) = ( 4.6 +/- 0.6 ) x 10 ( -10 ) cm ( 3 ) molecule ( -1 ) s ( -1 ) ; branching ratio for reactive quenching are 0.76 +/- 0.12 and 0.94 +/- 0.06 for the SO ( 2 ) and CS ( 2 ) reaction , respectively . All uncertainty reported above are estimate of accuracy ( 2 sigma ) and rate coefficient k ( i ) ( T ) ( i = 1 ; 2 ) calculated from the above Arrhenius expression have estimated accuracy of +15 % ( 2 sigma ) .

aVRate coefficient , k , for the gas-phase reaction of the OH radical with ( Z ) -CF ( 3 ) CH-CH=CF ( 3 ) ( cis-1,1,1,4,4,4-hexafluoro-2-butene ) were measured under pseudo-first-order condition in OH using pulsed laser photolysis ( PLP ) to produce OH and laser-induced fluorescence ( LIF ) to detect it . Rate coefficient were measured over a range of temperature ( 212-374 K ) and bath gas pressure ( 20-200 Torr ; He , N ( 2 ) ) and found to be independent of pressure over this range of condition . The rate coefficient ha a non-Arrhenius behavior that is well-described by the expression k ( 1 ) ( T ) = ( 5.73 +/- 0.60 ) x 10 ( -19 ) x T ( 2 ) x exp [ ( 678 +/- 10 ) /T ] cm ( 3 ) molecule ( -1 ) s ( -1 ) where k ( 1 ) ( 296 K ) wa measured to be ( 4.91 +/- 0.50 ) x 10 ( -13 ) cm ( 3 ) molecule ( -1 ) s ( -1 ) and the uncertainty are at the 2 sigma level and include estimated systematic error . Rate coefficient for the analogous OD radical reaction were determined over a range of temperature ( 262-374 K ) at 100 Torr ( He ) to be k ( 2 ) ( T ) = ( 4.81 +/- 0.20 ) x 10 ( -19 ) x T ( 2 ) x exp [ ( 776 +/- 15 ) /T ] , with k ( 2 ) ( 296 K ) = ( 5.73 +/- 0.50 ) x 10 ( -13 ) cm ( 3 ) molecule ( -1 ) s ( -1 ) . OH radical rate coefficient were also measured at 296 , 345 , and 375 K using a relative rate technique and found to be in good agreement with the PLP-LIF result . A room-temperature rate coefficient for the O ( 3 ) + ( Z ) -CF ( 3 ) CH-CH=CF ( 3 ) reaction wa measured using an absolute method with O ( 3 ) in excess to be < 6 x 10 ( -21 ) cm ( 3 ) molecule ( -1 ) s ( -1 ) . The atmospheric lifetime of ( Z ) -CF ( 3 ) CH-CHCF ( 3 ) due to loss by OH reaction wa estimated to be similar to 20 day . Infrared absorption spectrum of ( Z ) -CF ( 3 ) CH-CH=CF ( 3 ) measured in this work were used to determine a ( Z ) -CF ( 3 ) CH-CH=CF ( 3 ) global warming potential ( GWP ) of similar to 9 for the 100 year time horizon . A comparison of the OH reactivity of ( Z ) -CF ( 3 ) CH-CHCF ( 3 ) with other unsaturated fluorinated compound is presented .

aVThe projected change of atmospheric composition and associated climatic parameter will challenge the agricultural production in way , which existing crop population have not previously experienced . Therefore , understanding the responsiveness to change of multiple environmental parameter in existing genotype is vital . In this study , the response in yield and biomass production of four different cultivar of oilseed rape ( Brassica nap L. ) were tested under five different combination of increased [ CO ( 2 ) ] ( 700 ppm ) , temperature ( +5 degree C ) and [ O ( 3 ) ] ( +40 ppb ) . Especially the multifactor treatment are relevant for prediction of the future production , a they mimic the multidimensional environmental change that are expected within this century . All treatment were given the same amount of water , which mimicked future limited water availability e.g . in treatment with elevated temperature . The biomass and yield parameter were found to be significantly cultivar dependent . However , in all cultivar elevated temperature caused a significant reduction in yield parameter , while biomass wa not affected significantly . Elevated [ CO ( 2 ) ] increased the vegetative biomass significantly , but seed yield wa only significantly enhanced in one of the four cultivar studied . Increased [ O ( 3 ) ] did not have significant effect on any of the cultivar . In general , the negative effect of a 5 degree C temperature elevation on yield could not be compensated by elevated [ CO ( 2 ) ] , when simultaneously applied in multifactor treatment . The evaluation of cultivar difference in productivity under elevated [ CO ( 2 ) ] in combination with increased temperature and [ O ( 3 ) ] is necessary to derive at a realistic prediction for the future food and biomass production and for the selection of cultivar providing an adaptation potential to environmental change . Our result suggest that future breeding of B. napu should be based on old cultivar , since more modern variety seem to have lower potential to respond to CO ( 2 ) and thus counteract the detrimental effect of yield reducing environmental factor such a temperature and O ( 3 ) .

aVAnimal housing is a major source of gaseous emission , such a ammonia ( NH ( 3 ) ) , methane ( CH ( 4 ) ) , nitrous oxide ( N ( 2 ) O ) , and carbon dioxide ( CO ( 2 ) ) . Ammonia is an atmospheric pollutant and responsible for eutrophication and soil acidification , while CO ( 2 ) , CH ( 4 ) , and N ( 2 ) O are greenhouse gas ( GHG ) that contribute to global warming . The quantification of gaseous emission from livestock building with natural ventilation system is a particularly difficult task and is associated with uncertainty that are largely unknown . One key issue is to measure the ventilation rate and then to quantify the gaseous emission . Therefore , in this study , the ventilation rate wa determined by three different method simultaneously . Field experiment were carried out to study the ventilation rate in a naturally ventilated dairy barn located in northern Germany during the summer season from 2006 to 2010 . The air exchange rate ( AER ) a well a the ventilation rate were determined by the decay of the radioactive tracer krypton-85 , the carbon dioxide ( CO ( 2 ) ) balance , which wa used a the reference method in this study , and the combined effect of wind pressure and temperature difference force ( WT method ) . Subsequently , the result were compared with each other by carrying out Pearson correlation analysis and developing a regression model . During each field experiment , continuous measurement of gas concentration ( NH ( 3 ) , CO ( 2 ) , CH ( 4 ) , and N ( 2 ) O ) inside and outside the building and ( 85 ) Kr tracer gas experiment were carried out . Meanwhile , the temperature wa measured and recorded inside and outside the barn . Furthermore , the wind velocity wa measured . Although the WT method showed minor overestimation by about 1.11 ( p & lt ; 0.05 ) time the reference method , it is not reliable because it showed no linear correlation ( 0.05 ; p = 0.88 ) with the reference method . This wa due to large fluctuation in the wind velocity ( direction and speed ) , which negatively affected the WT method , which is basically dependent on wind velocity . In contrast , the ( 85 ) Kr tracer gas technique showed a good linear correlation ( 0.82 ; p & lt ; 0.05 ) with the reference method , which accentuates that the ( 85 ) Kr tracer gas technique is a promising method . However , this technique overestimated the air exchange rate by about 2.05 ( p & lt ; 0.05 ) time the reference method . Therefore , the ( 85 ) Kr tracer gas technique should be further developed to produce value consistent with those estimated by the reference method . The emission factor , subject to the reference method , were 32 , 157.7 , 13736 , and 7.9 kg year ( -1 ) AU ( -1 ) for NH ( 3 ) , CH ( 4 ) , CO ( 2 ) , and N ( 2 ) O , respectively .

aVNitrogen trifluoride , NF ( 3 ) , a trace gas of purely anthropogenic origin with a large global warming potential is accumulating in the Earth 's atmosphere . Large uncertainty are however associated with it atmospheric removal rate . In this work , experimental and theoretical kinetic tool were used to study the reaction of NF ( 3 ) with three of the principal gas-phase atmospheric oxidant : O ( ( 1 ) D ) , OH and O ( 3 ) . For reaction ( R2 ) with O ( ( 1 ) D ) , rate coefficient of k ( 2 ) ( 212-356 K ) = ( 2.0 +/- 0.3 ) x 10 ( -11 ) cm ( 3 ) molecule ( -1 ) s ( -1 ) were obtained in direct competitive kinetics experiment , and experimental and theoretical evidence wa obtained for F-atom product formation . These result indicate that whilst photolysis in the stratosphere remains the principal fate of NF ( 3 ) , reaction with O ( ( 1 ) D ) is significant and wa previously underestimated in atmospheric lifetime calculation . Experimental evidence of F-atom production from 248 nm photolysis of NF ( 3 ) wa also obtained , indicating that quantum yield for NF ( 3 ) destruction remain significant throughout the UV . No evidence wa found for reaction ( R3 ) of NF ( 3 ) with OH indicating that this process make little or no contribution to NF ( 3 ) removal from the atmosphere . An upper-limit of k ( 3 ) ( 298 K ) < 4 x 10 ( -16 ) cm ( 3 ) molecule ( -1 ) s ( -1 ) wa obtained experimentally ; theoretical analysis suggests that the true rate coefficient is more than ten order of magnitude smaller . An upper-limit of k ( 4 ) ( 296 K ) < 3 x 10 ( -25 ) cm ( 3 ) molecule ( -1 ) s ( -1 ) wa obtained in experiment to investigate O ( 3 ) + NF ( 3 ) ( R4 ) . Altogether these result underpin calculation of a long ( several hundred year ) lifetime for NF ( 3 ) . In the course of this work rate coefficient ( in unit of 10 ( -11 ) cm 3 molecule ( -1 ) s ( -1 ) ) for removal of O ( 1 D ) by n-C ( 5 ) H ( 12 ) , k ( 6 ) = ( 50 +/- 5 ) and by N ( 2 ) , k ( 7 ) = ( 3.1 +/- 0.2 ) were obtained . Uncertainties quoted throughout are 2 sigma precision only .

aVPhotosynthesis is the origin of oxygenic life on the planet , and it model are the core of all model of plant biology , agriculture , environmental quality and global climate change . A theory is presented here , based on single process biochemical reaction of Rubisco , recognizing that : In the light , Rubisco activase help separate Rubisco from the stored ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate ( RuBP ) , activates Rubisco with carbamylation and addition of Mg ( 2+ ) , and then produce two product , in two step : ( Step 1 ) Reaction of Rubisco with RuBP produce a Rubisco-enediol complex , which is the carboxylase-oxygenase enzyme ( Enco ) and ( Step 2 ) Enco capture CO ( 2 ) and/or O ( 2 ) and produce intermediate product leading to production and release of 3-phosphoglycerate ( PGA ) and Rubisco . PGA interactively control ( 1 ) the carboxylation-oxygenation , ( 2 ) electron transport , and ( 3 ) triosephosphate pathway of the Calvin-Benson cycle that lead to the release of glucose and regeneration of RuBP . Initially , the total enzyme participates in the two step of the reaction transitionally and it rate follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics . But , for a continuous steady state , Rubisco must be divided into two concurrently active segment for the two step . This cause a deviation of the steady state from the transitional rate . Kinetic model are developed that integrate the transitional and the steady state reaction . They are tested and successfully validated with verifiable experimental data . The single-process theory is compared to the widely used two-process theory of Farquhar et al . ( 1980 . Planta 149 , 78-90 ) , which assumes that the carboxylation rate is either Rubisco-limited at low CO ( 2 ) level such a CO ( 2 ) compensation point , or RuBP regeneration-limited at high CO ( 2 ) . Since the photosynthesis rate can not increase beyond the two-process theory 's Rubisco limit at the CO ( 2 ) compensation point , net photosynthesis can not increase above zero in daylight , and since there is always respiration at night , it lead to progressively negative daily CO ( 2 ) fixation with no possibility of oxygenic life on the planet . The Rubisco-limited theory at low CO ( 2 ) also contradicts all experimental evidence for low substrate reaction , and for all known enzyme , Rubisco included . ( C ) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

aVWe report a nitrogen isotope record ( ODP Site 1233 ) from the southern Chile margin at 41 degree S. The site is located slightly south of the southern boundary of the Peru-Chile upwelling system and the associated oxygen minimum zone off Peru and northern Chile . We show that our nitrogen isotope record , from the time interval 0-50 calendar kiloyears before present ( ka B.P . ) , bear an atypical pattern both in shape and timing when compared with record obtained from either the continental margin of the eastern Pacific or the Subantarctic Zone ( SAZ ) of the Southern Ocean . The delta ( 15 ) N value at Site 1233 are relatively high throughout the record , varying between 9 part per thousand . and 13 part per thousand . The iriajor feature are a pronounced delta ( 15 ) N increase at the beginning of the deglaciation , a maximum from 19 to 10 ka B.P . ; thereafter a large decrease during the early Holocene , and millenial scale oscillation showing an Antarctic timing . We propose that the record result from an amalgam of low-latitude and high-latitude process . Low-latitude process , including a stronger advection signal of heavy nitrate from the denitrifying zone off Peru and northern Chile , would explain the timing of the deglaciation rise and the heaviest value found over this interval , excluding the Antarctic Cold Reversal period . The overall difference between site 1233 and record from Peru and northwest American margin suggest however that the origin of the delta ( 15 ) N signal off Chile is largely controlled by hydrologic and climatic change in the Southern Ocean . We propose that the interplay between nutrient demand in the SAZ and latitudinal shift of hydrologic front controlled both the concentration and the isotopic signature of the remaining nitrate delivered to the Chile margin . Then , the glacial surface water of the southern Chile margin were likely lower in nitrate concentration and bear a higher delta ( 15 ) N than during interglacial period . ( c ) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

aVSmog chamber/FTIR technique were used to study the atmospheric chemistry of the Z and E isomer of CF3CF=CHF , which we refer to a CF3CF=CHF ( Z ) and CF3CF=CHF ( E ) . The rate constant k ( Cl + CF3CF=CHF ( Z ) ) = ( 4.36 +/- 0.48 ) x 10 ( -11 ) , k ( OH + CF3CF=CHF ( Z ) ) = ( 1.22 +/- 0.14 ) x 10 ( -12 ) , and k ( O-3 + CF3CF=CHF ( Z ) ) = ( 1.45 +/- 0.15 ) x 10 ( -21 ) cm ( 3 ) molecule ( -1 ) s ( -1 ) were determined for the Z isomer of CF3CF=CHF in 700 Torr air diluent at 296 +/- 2 K. The rate constant k ( Cl + CF3CF=CHF ( E ) ) = ( 5.00 +/- 0.56 ) x 10 ( -11 ) , k ( OH + CF3CF=CHF ( E ) ) = ( 2.15 +/- 0.23 ) x 10 ( -12 ) , and k ( O-3 + CF3CF=CHF ( E ) ) = ( 1.98 +/- 0.15 ) x 10 ( -20 ) cm ( 3 ) molecule ( -1 ) s ( -1 ) were determined for the E isomer of CF3CF=CHF in 700 Torr air diluent at 296 2 K. Both the Cl-atom and OH-radical-initiated atmospheric oxidation of CF3CF=CHF give CF3C ( O ) F and HC ( O ) F in molar yield indistinguishable from 100 % for both the Z and E isomer . CF3CF=CHF ( Z ) ha an atmospheric lifetime of approximately 18 day and a global warming potential ( 100 year time horizon ) of approximately 6 . CF3CF=CHF ( E ) ha an atmospheric lifetime of approximately 10 day and a global warming potential ( 100 year time horizon ) of approximately 3 . CF3CF=CHF ha a negligible global warming potential and will not make any significant contribution to radiative forcing of climate change .

aVPlio-Pleistocene East African grassland expansion and faunal macroevolution , including that of our own lineage , are attributed to global climate change . To further understand environmental factor of early hominin evolution , we reconstruct the paleogeographic distribution of vegetation ( C ( 3 ) -C ( 4 ) pathway ) by stable carbon isotope ( delta ( 13 ) C ) analysis of pedogenic carbonate from the Plio-Pleistocene Koobi Fora region , northeast Lake Turkana Basin , Kenya . We analyzed 202 nodule ( 530 measurement ) from ten paleontological/archaeological collecting area spanning environment over a 50-km ( 2 ) area . We compared result across subregions in evolving fluviolacustrine depositional environment in the Koobi Fora Formation from 2.0-1.5 Ma , a stratigraphic interval that temporally bracket grassland ascendancy in East Africa . Significant difference in delta ( 13 ) C value between subregions are explained by paleogeographic control on floral composition and distribution . Our result indicate grassland expansion between 2.0 and 1.75 Ma , coincident with major shift in basin-wide sedimentation and hydrology . Hypotheses may be correct in linking Plio-Pleistocene hominin evolution to environmental change from global climate ; however , based on our result , we interpret complexity from proximate force that mitigated basin evolution . An similar to 2.5 Ma tectonic event in southern Ethiopia and northern Kenya exerted strong effect on paleography in the Turkana Basin from 2.0-1.5 Ma , contributing to the shift from a closed , lacustrine basin to one dominated by open , fluvial condition . We propose basin transformation decreased residence time for Omo River water and expanded subaerial floodplain landscape , ultimately leading to reduced proportion of wooded flora and the establishment of habitat suitable for grassland community .

aVGlobal warming is mainly caused by CO ( 2 ) emission from thermal power plant , which burn fossil fuel with air . One of the countermeasure technology to prevent global warming is CO ( 2 ) recovery from combustion flue gas and the , sequestration of CO ( 2 ) underground or in the ocean . SOFC and other fuel cell call produce high-concentration CO ( 2 ) , because the reformed fuel gas reacts with oxygen electrochemically Without being mixed with air , or diluted by N ( 2 ) . Thus , we propose to operate the multistage SOFCs under high utilization of reformed fuel for obtaining high-concentration CO ( 2 ) . In this report , we have estimated the multistage SOFCs ' performance considering H ( 2 ) diffusion and the combined cycle efficiency of multistage SOFC/gas turbine/CO ( 2 ) recovery power plant . The power generation efficiency of our CO ( 2 ) recovery combined cycle is 68.5 % and the efficiency of conventional SOFC/GT cycle is 57.8 % including the CO ( 2 ) recovery airline process .

aVDetermining effect of elevated CO ( 2 ) on the tolerance of photosynthesis to acute heat-stress ( heat wave ) is necessary for predicting plant response to global warming , a photosynthesis is thermolabile and acute heat-stress and atmospheric CO ( 2 ) will increase in the future . Few study have examined this , and past result are variable , which may be due to methodological variation . To address this , we grew two C ( 3 ) and two C ( 4 ) specie at current or elevated CO ( 2 ) and three different growth temperature ( GT ) . We assessed photosynthetic thermotolerance in both unacclimated ( basal tolerance ) and pre-heat-stressed ( preHS = acclimated ) plant . In C ( 3 ) specie , basal thermotolerance of net photosynthesis ( P ( n ) ) wa increased in high CO ( 2 ) , but in C ( 4 ) specie , P ( n ) thermotlerance wa decreased by high CO ( 2 ) ( except Zea may at low GT ) ; CO ( 2 ) effect in preHS plant were mostly small or absent , though high CO ( 2 ) wa detrimental in one C ( 3 ) and one C ( 4 ) specie at warmer GT . Though high CO ( 2 ) generally decreased stomatal conductance , decrease in P ( n ) during heat stress were mostly due to non-stomatal effect . Photosystem II ( PSII ) efficiency wa often decreased by high CO ( 2 ) during heat stress , especially at high GT ; CO ( 2 ) effect on post-PSII electron transport were variable . Thus , high CO ( 2 ) often affected photosynthetic theromotolerance , and the effect varied with photosynthetic pathway , growth temperature , and acclimation state . Most importantly , in heat-stressed plant at normal or warmer growth temperature , high CO ( 2 ) may often decrease , or not benefit a expected , tolerance of photosynthesis to acute heat stress . Therefore , interactive effect of elevated CO ( 2 ) and warmer growth temperature on acute heat tolerance may contribute to future change in plant productivity , distribution , and diversity .

aVThe high resolution ( up to 0.0007 cm ( -1 ) ) infrared diode laser spectrum of CF ( 3 ) Br ( Halon 1301 ) with natural isotopic abundance ha been investigated in the region 1090-1130 cm ( -1 ) , characterized by the presence of the 25 and nu ( 2 ) + nu ( 3 ) absorption and several weaker hot band . The rovibrational analysis of the data , obtained employing a slit-jet system ( rotational temperature of about 50 K ) together with those recorded at 200 K , led to a complete and accurate set of spectroscopic constant for the band of both the bromine isotopologues . Integrated band intensity have been obtained for all the absorption in the spectral range 450-2500 cm ( -1 ) . The high resolution data and information concerning the cross-sections of this molecule can be useful for it remote sensing and for better modelling it contribution to global warming .

aVHemispherically and temporally asymmetric tropical precipitation response to global warming are evaluated in 13 different coupled atmosphere-ocean climate model stimulation . In the late boreal summer , hemispherical average of the tropical precipitation anomaly from the multimodel ensemble show a strong positive trend in the Northern Hmeisphere and a weak negative trend in the Southern Hemisphere . In the late austral summer , on the other hand , the trend are reversed . This implies that the summer hemisphere becomes wetter and the winter hemisphere becomes a little drier in the tropic . Thus , the seasonal range of tropical precipitation , difference between wet and dry season , is increased . Zonal average of the precipitation anomaly from the multimodel ensemble also reveal a meridional movement , which basically follows the seasonal migration of the main convection zone . Similar asymmetric feature can be found in all 13 climate model simulation used in this study . Based on the moisture budget analysis , the vertical moisture advection associated with mean circulation is the main contribution for the robustness of the asymmetric distribution of the tropical precipitation anomaly . Under global warming , tropospheric water vapor increase a the temperature rise and most enhanced water vapor is in the lower troposphere . The acending motion of the Hadley circulation then transport more water vapor upward , that is , anomalous moisture convergence , and enhances precipitation over the main convection zone . On the other hand , the thermodynamic effect associated with the descending motion of the HAdley circulation , that is , anomalous moisture divergence , reduces the precipitation over the descending region .

aVThe summer relative humidity ( RH ) change in Hokkaido , northern Japan , since 1776 were reconstructed using the oxygen isotope ratio of the tree ring cellulose of two living oak tree . We investigated the direct relationship between the decadal-centennial variation in the summer RH in northern Japan and the climate index of atmospheric circulation to understand the factor affecting the change in the hydrological climate in northern Japan . The variation in the summer RH are negatively correlated with those in the annual PDO index since 1781 . This is probably because the humid southerly wind from the western Pacific Ocean blow toward northern Japan with the intensified Pacific high when the PDO index is lower . Further , the fluctuation in the summer RH are positively correlated with those in the summer AO index during 1781-1930 , but they are negatively correlated with those in the summer AO during 1940-1997 . During the 1930s , the AO index changed from the negative to positive on the average . The drastic shift in it correlation is explained by the difference between atmospheric circulation in the low-AO period ( 1899-1930 ) and the high-AO period ( 1970-2000 ) . The summer RH in northern Japan wa regulated by the summer AO during 1781-1930 ( the cold period ) and the annual PDO during 1940-1997 ( the warm period ) . As a consequence of global warming , the midlatitude forcing such a PDO might become stronger than the high-latitude forcing such a AO on the hydrological climate in northern Japan .

aVExamining tropical regional precipitation anomaly under global warming in 10 coupled global climate model , several mechanism are consistently found . The tendency of rainfall to increase in convergence zone with large climatological precipitation and to decrease in subsidence regions-the rich-get-richer mechanism-has previously been examined in different approximation by Chou and Neelin , and Held and Soden . The effect of increased moisture transported by the mean circulation ( the `` direct moisture effect '' or `` thermodynamic component '' in respective terminology ) is relatively robust , while dynamic feedback is poorly understood and differs among model . The argument outlined state that the thermodynamic component should be a good approximation for large-scale average ; this is confirmed for average across convection zone and descent region , respectively . Within the convergence zone , however , dynamic feedback can substantially increase or decrease precipitation anomaly . Regions of negative precipitation anomaly within the convergence zone are associated with local weakening of ascent , and some of these exhibit horizontal dry advection associated with the `` upped-ante '' mechanism . Regions of increased ascent have strong positive precipitation anomaly enhanced by moisture convergence . This dynamic feedback is consistent with reduced gross moist stability due to increased moisture not being entirely compensated by effect of tropospheric warming and a vertical extent of convection . Regions of reduced ascent with positive precipitation anomaly are on average associated with change in the vertical structure of vertical velocity , which extends to higher level . This yield an increase in the gross moist stability that opposes ascent . The reduction in ascent associated with gross moist stability and upped-ante effect , respectively , combine to yield reduced ascent averaged across the convergence zone . Over climatological subsidence region , positive precipitation anomaly can be associated with a convergence zone shift induced locally by anomalous heat flux from the ocean . Negative precipitation anomaly have a contribution from the thermodynamic component but can be enhanced or reduced by change in the vertical velocity . Regions of enhanced subsidence are associated with an increased outgoing longwave radiation or horizontal cold convection . Reductions of subsidence are associated with change of the vertical profile of vertical velocity , increasing gross moist stability .

aVTemperature sensitivity of soil respiration ( Q ( 10 ) ) is an important parameter in modeling effect of global warming on ecosystem carbon release . Experimental study of soil respiration have ubiquitously indicated that Q ( 10 ) ha high spatial heterogeneity . However , most biogeochemical model still use a globally constant Q ( 10 ) in projecting future climate change , partly because no spatial pattern of Q ( 10 ) value ha been derived . In this study , we conducted an inverse analysis to retrieve a global pattern of spatially heterogeneous Q ( 10 ) value by assimilating data of soil organic carbon into a process-based terrestrial carbon model ( Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach model ) at spatial resolution of 1 degree by 1 degree . The estimated Q ( 10 ) value were , in turn , incorporated into soil respiration model to evaluate their impact on global respiratory carbon release from soil ( i.e. , total soil respiration is equal to microbial and root respiration ) and from microbial decomposition ( i.e. , heterotrophic respiration ) . Our result show that the optimized Q ( 10 ) value are spatially heterogeneous and vary with environmental factor . In general , Q ( 10 ) value tends to be high in the high-latitudinal region . The mean Q ( 10 ) value for different biome range from 1.43 to 2.03 , with the highest value in tundra and the lowest value in desert . When spatially heterogeneous Q ( 10 ) value were incorporated into global soil respiration model , simulated soil respiration ha a feedback intensity of 3.21 Pg C degree C ( -1 ) to climate warming , which is approximately 40 % higher than that with a globally invariant Q ( 10 ) value . The modeled heterotrophic respiration ha a feedback intensity of 2.26 Pg C degree C ( -1 ) , about 25 % higher than that derived from a globally invariant Q ( 10 ) value . Overall , the feedback intensity of soil carbon release to climate warming depends not only on the magnitude of a global mean of Q ( 10 ) value but also their spatial variability .

aVTo reduce the magnitude of anthropogenic global warming it is necessary to remove CO ( 2 ) ( g ) from the effluent stream of coal-fired power plant and to sequester the CO ( 2 ) either a a liquid or by reaction with other compound . A major difficulty in achieving this goal arises from the very weak acidity Of CO ( 2 ) ( g ) , causing it to react only incompletely with weak base , although this weak interaction doe provide a mean for `` stripping '' the CO ( 2 ) from the acid-base complex at high temperature . Reaction with strong base like NaOH yield more stable complex , but massive amount of chemical reactant would need to be purchased and chemical product like NaHCO ( 3 ) then stored . However , when gas-phase CO ( 2 ) reacts with the weak base water ( or when bicarbonate reacts with strong acid ) the unstable product monomeric `` H ( 2 ) CO ( 3 ) '' can be formed . The free energy required is about 16 kcal/mol in the gas phase and about 10 kcal/mol in aqueous solution . This energy can be supplied by particle or photon excitation and is only a small fraction of the energy released when a mole of CH ( 4 ) is converted to a mole of CO ( 2 ) . Although this monomeric compound is highly unstable , it oligomers are considerably more stable , due to internal H-bonding , with free energy for the larger oligomers in the gas phase which are about 4 kcal/ ( mol of H ( 2 ) CO ( 3 ) ) lower , only about 6 kcal/mol H ( 2 ) CO ( 3 ) higher than the gas-phase combination of CO ( 2 ) and H ( 2 ) O at room temperature . Also , at lower temperature the entropic penalty for the oligomer is le and oligomeric H ( 2 ) CO ( 3 ) becomes stable around the sublimation temperature of dry ice . This indicates that it may be possible to capture gas-phase CO ( 2 ) directly , using only cheap and abundant H ( 2 ) O a a reactant and to store the resulting ( H ( 2 ) CO ( 3 ) ) ( n ) a a oligomeric solid at only moderately cold temperature . These conclusion are based on quantum computation that accurately reproduce the structure , spectrum , and stability of H ( 2 ) CO ( 3 ) oligomers . Methods for producing and characterizing the H ( 2 ) CO ( 3 ) oligomers are discussed . However , some aspect of the proposed scheme are quite speculative and will require additional investigation . Several important question need to be answered before the feasibility of this procedure on a planetary scale can be assessed , particularly those involving the vapor pressure curve , heat of sublimation , density , and compressibility of ( H ( 2 ) CO ( 3 ) ) ( n ) .

aVReduction of greenhouse gas emission is becoming essential for struggling against global warming . Priority ha been given to source where carbon dioxide ( CO ( 2 ) ) emission are the largest and the most concentrated . Power plant using fossil fuel offer a great opportunity of applying CO ( 2 ) recovery process . The O ( 2 ) /CO ( 2 ) cycle is an interesting option since CO ( 2 ) concentration in the flue gas is highly increased . This cycle ha been applied to a natural gas combined cycle ( NGCC ) using an advanced gas turbine ( GE9H ) . The aim of this study is to ass by simulation the energy and environmental performance of this new type of power plant . The oxygen required is produced by an air separation unit ( ASU ) that can deliver oxygen with a purity ranging between 85 and 97 mol. % A CO ( 2 ) recovery process based on a cryogenic separation of carbon dioxide from inert gas ha been designed and assessed . The impact of CO ( 2 ) capture ha been calculated with the Aspen plus ' software . With an O ( 2 ) purity of 90 mol. % and an 85 % CO ( 2 ) recovery rate , the net electrical efficiency reach 51.3 % ( based on the low heating value ( LHV ) ) . This corresponds to an efficiency loss of 8.1 % -points in comparison with the base case . The quantity of avoided CO ( 2 ) is about 280 g kW ( -1 ) h ( -1 ) . These result have been compared with a conventional amine scrubbing applied to a NGCC . With a lean CO ( 2 ) loading of 0.16 mol CO ( 2 ) /mol amine , this process lead to a net electrical efficiency of 49.1 % ( LHV ) . The conversion into an O ( 2 ) /CO ( 2 ) Cycle seems to be more efficient than amine scrubbing but more difficult to implement because of the specific gas turbine . ( c ) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

aVMicrobial methane oxidation is a key process in the global methane cycle . In the context of global warming , it is important to understand the response of the methane-oxidizing microbial community to temperature change in term of community structure and activity . We studied microbial methane oxidation in a laboratory-column system in which a diffusive CH ( 4 ) /O ( 2 ) counter gradient wa maintained in an unsaturated porous medium at temperature between 4 and 20 degree C. Methane oxidation wa highly efficient at all temperature , a on average 99 +/- 0.5 % of methane supplied to the system wa oxidized . The methanotrophic community that established in the model system after initial inoculation appeared to be able to adapt quickly to different temperature , a methane emission remained low even after the system wa subjected to abrupt temperature change . FISH showed that Type I a well a Type II methanotrophs were probably responsible for the observed activity in the column system , with a dominance of Type I methanotrophs . Cloning and sequencing suggested that Type I methanotrophs were represented by the genus Methylobacter while Type II were represented by Methylocystis . The result suggest that in an unsaturated system with diffusive substrate supply , direct effect of temperature on apparent methanotrophic activity and community may be of minor importance . However , this remains to be verified in the field .

aVWe use a simple methodology to test whether a set of atmospheric climate model with prescribed radiative forcings and ocean surface condition can reproduce twentieth century climate variability . Globally , rapid land surface warming since the 1970s is reproduced by some model but others warm too slowly . In the tropic , air-sea coupling allows model to reproduce the Southern Oscillation but it strength varies between model . We find a strong relationship between the Southern Oscillation in global temperature and the rate of global warming , which could in principle be used to identify model with realistic climate sensitivity . This relationship and a weak response to ENSO suggests weak sensitivity to change in sea surface temperature in some of the model used here . In the tropic , most model reproduce part of the observed Sahel drought . In the extratropics , model do not reproduce the observed increase in the North Atlantic Oscillation in response to forcings , through internal variability , or a a combination of both .

The Cl-initiated atmospheric oxidation of HCF ( 2 ) O ( CF ( 2 ) CF ( 2 ) O ) ( x ) CF ( 2 ) H , x = 2,3 and 4 , gave COF ( 2 ) in molar yield of ( 593 +/- 41 ) % , ( 758 +/- 71 ) % and ( 939 +/- 73 ) % , respectively , with no other observable carbon-containing product ( i.e. , essentially complete conversion of the hydrofluoropolyethers into COF ( 2 ) ) . Quantitative infrared spectrum for HCF ( 2 ) O ( CF ( 2 ) CF ( 2 ) O ) ( x ) CF ( 2 ) H ( x=2-4 ) were recorded and used to estimate the radiative efficiency of the title compound ( 1.07 , 1.33 , and 1.36 Wm ( -2 ) ppb ( -1 ) ) . Global warming potential ( 100 year time horizon ) of 3870 , 4730 and 5060 were estimated for HCF ( 2 ) O ( CF ( 2 ) CF ( 2 ) O ) ( x ) CF ( 2 ) H , x = 2 , 3 and 4 , respectively . The result are discussed with respect to the atmospheric chemistry and environmental impact of hydrofluoropolyethers .
