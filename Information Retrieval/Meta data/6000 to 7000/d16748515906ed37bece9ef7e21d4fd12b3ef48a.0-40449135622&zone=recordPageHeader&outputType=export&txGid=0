While most nations are promoting the expansion of conventional crops, India's strategy for biofuels is to promote Jatropha curcas, a drought-tolerant, perennial crop with little prior commercial track record. The aim of this paper is three-fold. (1) To compare the characteristics of various crops with their potential as biofuels in order to assess the relative advantages and disadvantages of Jatropha curcas. (2) To analyze the implications of current biofuel policies for food supply, agricultural water demand and the rural poor. (3) To highlight briefly some alternative strategies that can overcome drawbacks in the current strategy. One conclusion is that although Jatropha curcas has a low water requirement, which is an important benefit, it has several other disadvantages. Another recommendation that emerges from this paper is that biofuel policies should also focus on short-duration, multi-purpose and proven drought-tolerant crops like sweet sorghum that can be adopted by small landholders while wasteland rehabilitation policies should focus on broader array of options, which can provide greater direct benefits to the rural poor. © IWA Publishing 2008.","Biofuel; India; Jatropha; Marginal land; Rural electrification; Sweet sorghum","Jatropha; Jatropha curcas",,,,,,"Ash, M., Dohlman, E., Oil Crops Outlook: Global oilseed harvests expected to sag in 2007 (2007) Report of Economic Research Service, , http://www.ers.usda.gov, OCS, 07i, October 15, 2007; Parikh, J., Balakrishnan, K., Laxmi, V., Biswas, H., Exposure from cooking with biofuels: Pollution monitoring and analysis for rural Tamil Nadu, India (2001) Energy, 26 (10), pp. 949-962. , October; Balooni, K., Economics of wastelands afforestation in India, a review (2003) New Forests, 26 (2), pp. 101-136; Beck, T., Ghosh, M., Common property resources and the poor: Findings from West Bengal (2000) Econ.
