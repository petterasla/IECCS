The resulting climate changes are expected to alter food production. The overall changes in temperature, moisture, carbon dioxide, insect pests, plant pathogens, and weeds associated with global warming are projected to reduce food production in North America. However, in Africa, the projected slight rise in rainfall is encouraging, especially since Africa already suffers from severe shortages of rainfall. For all regions, a reduction in fossil fuel burning is vital. Adoption of sound ecological resource management, especially soil and water conservation and the prevention of deforestation, is important. Together, these steps will benefit agriculture, the environment, farmers, and society as a whole. © 1992 Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics.","agriculture; climate change; ethics; food; technologies","carbon dioxide; climatic change; ethical issue; food production; fossil fuel; global warming; man-environment relations",,,,,,"Abelson, P.H., Uncertainties about global warming (1990) Science, 247, p. 1529; Abrahamson, D., (1989) The Challenge, of Global Warming, , D.E., Abrahaon, Island Press, Washington, DC; Adair, C.R., Miller, M.D., Beachell, H.M., Rice improvement and culture in the United States (1962) Advances in Agronomy, 14, pp. 61-108; Adisarwanto, T., The influence of planting method and mulching on soybean seed yield (1986) Soybean Yield in Tropical and Subtropical Cropping Systems, pp. 215-217. , Proc.
