We used a field-based experiment to examine the climate change scenario of more frequent fires with altered invertebrate assemblages on the decomposition of Eucalyptus leaves. Our design comprised three fire regimes [long-term fire exclusion (FE), long-term frequent burning (FB) and FE altered to FB (FEFB)] and two litter bag mesh sizes (8.0 and 0.2 mm) that either permitted or denied access to the leaf litter by most invertebrates. We found a significant interaction effect between fire regime and mesh size in losses of litter mass and net carbon (C). Compared with the regime of FE, with more frequent burning (FB and FEFB) the pace of decomposition was slowed by 41% (when access to litter by most invertebrates is not impeded). For the regime of FE, denying access to leaf litter by most invertebrates did not alter the pace of decomposition. Conversely, under regimes of frequently burning, restricting access to the litter by most invertebrates altered the pace of decomposition by 46%. Similar results were found for net C. For net losses of nitrogen (N), no interaction effects between fire regime and mesh size were detected, although both main effects were significant. Our results show that by modifying disturbance regimes such as fire frequency, global climate change has the potential to modify the mechanism by which ecosystems function. With more FB, decomposition is driven not only by fire regime induced changes in substrate quality and/or physiochemical conditions but through the interaction of disturbance regime with animal assemblages mediating ecosystem processes. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","C:N ratio; Decomposers; Disturbance regime; Ecosystem functioning; Ecosystem processes; Fine fuel loads; Global climate change; Leaf litter decomposition; Prescribed burning; Soil fauna","burning; climate change; decomposition; ecosystem function; ecosystem response; environmental disturbance; global change; invertebrate; litter; Animalia; Eucalyptus; Invertebrata",,,,,,"Bardgett, R., (2005) The Biology of Soil: A Community and Ecosystem Approach, , Oxford University Press, London; Beare, M.H., Coleman, D.C., Crossley, D.A., Hendrix, P.F., Odum, E.P., A hierarchical approach to evaluating the significance of soil biodiversity to biogeochemical cycling (1995) Plant and Soil, 170, pp. 5-22; Biggs, R., Biggs, H.C., Dunne, T.T., Govender, N., Potgieter, A.L.F., Experimental burn plot trials in the Kruger National Park: history, experimental design and suggestions for data analysis (2003) Koedoe, 46, pp. 1-15; Birk, E.M., Bridges, R.G., Recurrent fires and fuel accumulation in even-aged Blackbutt (Eucalyptus pilularis) forests (1989) Forest Ecology and Management, 29, pp. 59-79; Blair, J.M., Crossley, D.A., Callaham, L.C., Effects of litter quality and microarthropods on N-dynamics and retention of exogenous 15N in decomposing litter (1992) Biology and Fertility of Soils, 12, pp. 241-252; Bradford, M.A., Jones, T.H., Bardgett, R.D., Impacts of soil faunal community composition on model grassland ecosystems (2002) Science, 298, pp. 615-618; (2002) Flammable Australia: The Fire Regimes and Biodiversity of a Continent, , Bradstock RA, Williams JE, Gill AM (eds), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK; Brennan, K.E.C., Ashby, L., Majer, J.D., Moir, M.L., Koch, J.M., Simplifying assessment of forest management practices for invertebrates: how effective are higher taxon and habitat surrogates for spiders following prescribed burning?
