The primary research objective in the field of post-combustion CO 2 capture process system is to improve effectiveness and efficiency of the process. Extensive literature review of the research showed that the dominant approach was to investigate the behaviors of the aqueous amine solvents for enchancing CO 2 capture efficiency. As the operation of an amine-based CO 2 capture system is complicated and involves monitoring over one hundred process parameters and careful manipulation of numerous valves and pumps, automated monitoring and process control can be a fruitful approach to enhance efficiency of the CO 2 capture process system. In this study, artificial intelligence techniques were applied for development of a knowledge-based expert system that effectively monitors and controls the CO 2 capture process system so as to enhance CO 2 capture efficiency. The Knowledge-Based System for Carbon Dioxide Capture (KBSCDC) was implemented with DeltaV Simulate (trademark of Emerson Corp., USA). DeltaV Simulate provides control utilities and algorithms which support the configuration of control strategies in modular components. The KBSCDC can conduct real-time monitoring and diagnosis, as well as suggest remedies for any abnormality detected. Also, the control strategies applied to the control devices of the process are simulated in KBSCDC. The expert system enhances performance and efficiency of the CO 2 capture process system because it supports automated diagnosis of the system should any abnormal conditions occur. In this way, costly downtime and maintenance are avoided. © 2011 ISEIS All rights reserved.","Carbon dioxide capture process system; Control; Diagnosis; Knowledge-based system; Monitoring","algorithm; automation; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; efficiency measurement; emission control; expert system; global warming; knowledge based system; literature review; maintenance; monitoring system; organic nitrogen compound; parameterization; real time; solvent",,,,,,"Alper, E., Reaction mechanism and kinetics of aqueous solutions of 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol and carbon dioxide (1990) Ind.
