It is shown that the intermediate unit processes (IUPs) are of global warming importance. Compared to earlier efforts in the field of environmental life cycle assessment of electronic products, this model enables a more partitioned LCA result, with respect to both components and processes. In our model the components are first divided into main groups and then into sub-groups. This division results in process modules for unit processes, some of which are similar to the ongoing components, thus, reducing the computational effort. The model is demonstrated for a ""cradle-to-gate"" calculation focusing on greenhouse gas emissions. Using scenario analysis for integrated circuits and printed wiring boards, the possible contribution from IUPs was analysed. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
