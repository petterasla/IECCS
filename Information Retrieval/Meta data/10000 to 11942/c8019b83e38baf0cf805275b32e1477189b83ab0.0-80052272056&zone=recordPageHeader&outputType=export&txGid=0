Carbon credit can also be obtained by adopting conservation reserve, where cropland is planted into perennial vegetation. Summer fallowing is also considered within the crediting process as credit is not given in years that a field is left un-vegetated. The carbon sequestration program has been advocated as a means to mitigate climate change while providing an added source of income for Montana farmers. There is lack of data, however, pertaining to the percentage of lands within this region that have not converted to no-till management, lands under certain crop intensities (e.g. those that are cropped every growing season vs. those that use a fallow-crop-fallow system), or cropland that have converted to perennial vegetation outside of the popular Conservation Reserve Program. Data is also sparse concerning the amount of soil organic carbon that might be sequestered given a conversion to no-till or conservation reserve. This study established regional percentage estimates of cropland under no-till, various degrees of crop intensity, and conservation reserve within north central Montana. Literature-based carbon sequestration estimates were used to generate carbon gain data associated with the conversation to no-till and to conservation reserve. These estimates were then applied to the area-based cropland statistics to estimate potential regional carbon sequestration associated with these management changes. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Agricultural system; Area-based; Carbon credits; Carbon sequestration; Conservation reserve program; Crop intensity; Growing season; Montana; No-till; Not given; Soil organic carbon; Climate change; Crops; Estimation; Vegetation; Organic carbon; agricultural land; agricultural management; agricultural worker; carbon sequestration; climate change; emissions trading; environmental economics; environmental protection; fallow; growing season; income distribution; perennial plant; soil carbon; soil organic matter; tillage; trade-environment relations; Montana; United States",,,,,,"Aase, J.K., Pikul, J.L., Crop and soil response to long-term practices in the northern Great Plains (1995) Agron J, 87, pp. 652-656; Angus, J.F., van Herwaarden, A.F., Increasing water use and water use efficiency in dryland wheat (2001) Agron J, 93, pp. 290-298; Bachu, S., CO 2 storage in geological media: role, means, status, and barriers to deployment (2008) Prog Energy Combust Sci, 34, pp. 254-273; Baer, S.G., Rice, C.W., Blair, J.M., Assessment of soil quality in fields with short and long term enrollment in the CRP (2000) J Soil Water Conserv, 33, pp. 142-152; Barrett, E.C., Curtis, L.F., (1999) Monitoring the Environment, p. 457. , Introduction to Environmental Remote Sensing, Gloucester: Stanley Thornes; Bayon, R., Hawn, A., Hamilton, K., (2007) Voluntary Carbon Markets: An International Business Guide to What they are and How they Work, p. 164. , London: Earthscan; Benz, U.C., Hofmann, P., Willhauck, G., Multi-resolution, object-oriented fuzzy analysis of remote sensing data for GIS-ready information (2004) ISPRS J Photogramm Remote Sensing, 58, pp. 239-258; Biradar, C.M., Thenkabail, P.S., Noojipady, P., A global map of rainfed cropland areas (GMRCA) at the end of last millennium using remote sensing (2009) Int J Appl Earth Obs Geoinf, 11, pp. 114-129; Black, A.L., Soil property changes associated with crop residue management in a wheat-fallow rotation (1973) Proc SSSA, 37, pp. 943-946; Black, A.L., Tanaka, D.L., A conservation tillage-cropping system study in the Northern Great Plains of the United States (1997) Soil Organic Matter in Temperate Agroecosystems, pp. 335-340. , E.
