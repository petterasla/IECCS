A substantial number of nitrogen-sulfur compounds can be formed from the reactions of sulfite and bisulfite ions with nitrogen oxyanions. A computer model is used to simulate the kinetics and to determine the effect of scrubber operating conditions on the production of nitrogen-sulfur compounds. With increasingly stringent regulations covering solid and liquid waste disposal, it is important to minimize undesirable byproducts in FGD systems. The modeling is also used to study the effect of scrubber conditions on the production of N 2O (nitrous oxide). Emission of N 2O into the atmosphere is undesirable because it has both significant ozone depletion potential and global warming potential. © 1991 American Chemical Society.",,,,,,,,,"Chang, S.-G.; Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, Applied Science Division, 1 Cyclotron Road, Berkeley, CA 94720, United States",,,,,,,,08870624,,,,"English",,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026123104
