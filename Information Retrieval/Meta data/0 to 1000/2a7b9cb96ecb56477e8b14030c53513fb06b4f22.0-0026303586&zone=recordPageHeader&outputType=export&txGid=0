The highland valleys between 1200 and 2850m have been inhabited by relatively large populations since prehistoric times. Early studies, beginning in the 1950s, were mainly ecological and related the people to their environment, but more recent work has emphasized change and continuity through time, reconstructing landscapes and climates from prehistoric times, through a brief period of colonialization, to present independence. The landscape, with cultivation dependent on the sweet potato and pig breeding, is a result of environment, economic, and social factors. Of concern for human occupation of the highlands are severe droughts, killing frosts, and heavy rains, and the possible consequences of global warming. -from Author",,"agricultural research; climatic change; highland valley; historical continuity; land use system; man-environment relations; mountain area; mountainous area; regional geography; Indonesia, Irian Jaya; New Guinea; Papua New Guinea",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026303586
