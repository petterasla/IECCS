In this study, the effects of bleaching (induced by elevated light and temperature) on the condition of symbiotic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium sp.) within the tissue of the hard coral Stylophora pistillata (Esper) were assessed using a suite of techniques. Bleaching of S. pistillata was accompanied by declines in the maximum potential quantum yield of photosynthesis (F v/Fm, measured using pulse amplitude modulated [PAM] fluorometry), an increase in the number of Sytox-green-stained algae (indicating compromised algal membrane integrity and cell death), an increase in 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluroscein diacetate (H2DCFDA)- stained algae (indicating increased oxidative stress), as well as ultrastructural changes (vacuolisation, losses of chlorophyll, and an increase in accumulation bodies). Algae expelled from S. pistillata exhibited a complete disorganisation of cellular contents; expelled cells contained only amorphous material. In situ samples taken during a natural mass coral bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef in February 2002 also revealed a high number of Sytox-labelled algae cells in symbio. Dinoflagellate degeneration during bleaching seems to be similar to the changes resulting from senescence-phase cell death in cultured algae. These data support a role for oxidative stress in the mechanism of coral bleaching and highlight the importance of algal degeneration during the bleaching of a reef coral.","Coral bleaching; Dinoflagellate; Global climate change; Symbiodinium; Symbiont; Temperature/light stress; Ultrastructure","bleaching; climate change; coral; coral bleaching; dinoflagellate; mortality; Australasia; Australia; Coral Sea; Great Barrier Reef; Pacific Ocean; Queensland; algae; Animalia; Anthozoa; Dinophyceae; Eukaryota; Halophila; Stylophora pistillata; Symbiodinium; Symbiodinium sp.",,,,,,"Allemand, D., Furla, P., Benazet-Tambutte, S., Mechanisms of carbon acquisition for endosymbiont photosynthesis in Anthozoa (1997) Can J Bot, 76, pp. 925-941; Ameisen, J.C., On the origin, evolution, and nature of programmed cell death: A timeline of four billion years (2002) Cell Death Differ, 9, pp. 367-393; Asada, K., Endo, T., Mano, J., Miyake, C., Molecular mechanisms of relaxation and protection from light stress (1998) Stress Responses of Photosynthetic Organisms, pp. 37-52. , Katoh K, Murata N (eds) Elsevier Science, Amsterdam; Berges, J.A., Falkowski, P.G., Physiological stress and cell death in marine phytoplankton: Induction of proteases in response to nitrogen or light limitation (1998) Limnol Oceanogr, 43, pp. 129-135; Berry, J., Björkman, O., Photosynthetic response and adaptation to temperature in higher plants (1980) Annu Rev Plant Physiol, 31, pp. 491-543; Brown, B.E., Le Tissier, M.D.A., Bythell, J.C., Mechanisms of bleaching deduced from histological studies of reef corals sampled during a natural bleaching event (1995) Mar Biol, 122, pp. 655-663; Brown, B.E., Downs, C.A., Dunne, R.P., Gibb, S.W., Exploring the basis of thermotolerance in the reef coral Goniastrea aspera (2002) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 242, pp. 119-129; Collen, J., Davison, I.R., In vivo measurement of active oxygen production in the brown alga Fucus evanescens using 2′,7′-dichlorohydrofluorescein diacetate (1997) J Phycol, 33, pp. 643-648; Dennis, C., Reef under threat from 'bleaching' outbreak (2002) Nature, 415, p. 947; Dodge, J.D., (1973) The Fine Structure of Algal Cells, , Academic Press, London; Dunn, S.R., Bythell, J.C., Le Tissier, M.D.A., Burnett, W.J., Thomason, J.C., Programmed cell death and cell necrosis activity during hyperthermic stress-induced bleaching of the sea anemone Aiptasia sp.
