Finally, this paper will show how Remsoft's spatial planning and modeling software system enables efficient and effective management of forests as carbon sinks.","Carbon credits; Carbon sequestration; Carbon trading; Forestry; Forests as carbon sinks; Remsoft; Spatial planning and modeling software","Carbon credits; Carbon sequestration; Carbon trading; Forests as carbon sinks; Remsoft; Spatial planning and modeling software; Computer software; Global warming; Planning; Timber; Forestry; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; economic analysis; emissions trading; forest management; forestry modeling; global warming; software; spatial analysis; Carbon; Computer Programs; Forestry; Forests; Mathematical Models; Planning; Pollution Control",,,,,,"Carbon Solutions Group.
