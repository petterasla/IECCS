Using an empirical relationship between sand and air temperature, we reconstructed the nest temperatures since 1855 at Ascension Island, a major green turtle (Chelonia mydas) rookery. Our results show that inter-beach thermal variations, previously ascribed to the albedo of the sand, which varies hugely from one beach to another, have persisted for the last century. Reconstructed nest temperatures varied by only 0.5 °C on individual beaches over the course of the nesting season, while the temperature difference between two key nesting beaches was always around 3 °C. Hence inter-beach thermal variations are the main factor causing a large range of incubation temperatures at this rookery. There was a general warming trend for nests, with a mean increase in reconstructed nest temperatures for different months of between 0.36 and 0.49 °C for the last 100 years.","Ascension Island; Climate change; Global warming; Reptile; Sex determination; Turtle","climate change; global warming; incubation; sex determination; temperature; turtle; Atlantic Ocean; Chelonia mydas; Cheloniidae; Mydas; Reptilia; Testudines",,,,,,"Broderick, A.C., Godley, B.J., Hays, G.C., Metabolic heating and the prediction of sex ratios for green turtles (Chelonia mydas) (2001) Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 74, pp. 161-170; Davenport, J., Sea turtles and the green house effect (1989) British Herpetological Society Bulletin, 29, pp. 11-15; Davenport, J., Temperature and the life-history strategies of sea turtles (1997) Journal of Thermal Biology, 22, pp. 479-488; Freedberg, S., Wade, M.J., Cultural inheritance as a mechanism for population sex-ratio bias in reptiles (2001) Evolution, 55, pp. 1049-1055; Godfrey, M.H., Barreto, R., Mrosovsky, N., Estimating past and present sex ratios of sea turtles in Suriname (1996) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 74, pp. 267-277; Godfrey, M.H., D'Amato, A.F., Marcovaldi, M.A., Pivotal temperatures and predicted sex ratios for hatching hawksbill turtles from Brazil (1999) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 77, pp. 1465-1473; Godley, B.J., Broderick, A.C., Glen, F., Temperature dependent sex determination of ascension island green turtles (2001) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 226, pp. 115-124; Godley, B.J., Broderick, A.C., Hays, G.C., Nesting of green turtles Chelonia mydas at Ascension Island, South Atlantic (2001) Biological Conservation, 97, pp. 151-158; Hays, G.C., Adams, C., Speakman, J.R., Reproductive investment by green turtles nesting on Ascension Island (1993) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 71, pp. 1098-1103; Hays, G.C., Adams, C.R., Mortimer, J.A., Inter-and intrabeach thermal variation for green turtle nests on Ascension Island, South Atlantic (1995) Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the UK, 75, pp. 405-411; Hays, G.C., Ashworth, J.S., Barnsley, M.J., The importance of sand albedo for the thermal conditions on sea turtle nesting beaches (2001) Oikos, 93, pp. 87-94; Hays, G.C., Godley, B.J., Broderick, A.C., Long-term thermal conditions on the nesting beaches of green turtles on Ascension Island (1999) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 185, pp. 297-299; Janzen, F.J., Climate change and temperature-dependent sex determination in reptiles (1994) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 91, pp. 7487-7490; Janzen, F.J., Paukstis, G.L., Environmental sex determination in reptiles: Ecology, evolution and experimental design (1991) Quarterly Review of Biology, 66, pp. 149-179; Marcovaldi, M.A., Godfrey, M.H., Mrosovsky, N., Estimating sex ratios of loggerhead turtles in Brazil from pivotal incubation durations (1997) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 75, pp. 755-770; Matsuzawa, Y., Sato, K., Sakamoto, W., Seasonal fluctuations in sand temperature: Effects on the incubation period and mortality of loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) preemergent hatchlings in Minabe, Japan (2002) Marine Biology, 140, pp. 639-646; Mortimer, J.A., Factors influencing beach selection by nesting sea turtles (1995) Biology and Conservation of Sea Turtles, pp. 45-51. , (ed.
