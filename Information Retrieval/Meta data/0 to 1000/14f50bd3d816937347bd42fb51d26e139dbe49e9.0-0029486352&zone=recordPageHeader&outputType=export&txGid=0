The experimental design, called HOTWORM, could keep a constant temperature difference of 3°C above ambient including freezing-thawing cycles. No changes in the soluble nitrogen pools could be measured at the end of the investigation. However, N2O-N emissions were much higher in the unheated plot (0.233 kg ha-1) compared with the heated one (0.058 kg ha-1). This effect could be caused by more frequent freezing-thawing cycles in the unheated plots, which showed the highest emission rates. -from Authors",,"carbon dioxide; GCM; global change; HOTWORM; IGBP; nitrogen cycle; nitrous oxide; soil temperature",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029486352
