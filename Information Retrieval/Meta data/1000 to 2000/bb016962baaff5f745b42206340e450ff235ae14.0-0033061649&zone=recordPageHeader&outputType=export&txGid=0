In this study, we applied a dual stable isotope approach to investigate the impact of elevated CO2 and elevated temperature on these components of soil CO2 efflux in Douglas-fir terracosms. We measured both soil CO2 efflux rates and the 13C and 18O isotopic compositions of soil CO2 efflux in 12 sun-lit and environmentally controlled terracosms with 4-year-old Douglas fir seedlings and reconstructed forest soils under two CO2 concentrations (ambient and 200 ppmv above ambient) and two air temperature regimes (ambient and 4 °C above ambient). The stable isotope data were used to estimate the relative contributions of different components to the overall soil CO2 efflux. In most cases, litter decomposition was the dominant component of soil CO2 efflux in this system, followed by rhizosphere respiration and soil organic matter oxidation. Both elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration and elevated temperature stimulated rhizosphere respiration and litter decomposition. The oxidation of soil organic matter was stimulated only by increasing temperature. Release of newly fixed carbon as root respiration was the most responsive to elevated CO2, while soil organic matter decomposition was most responsive to increasing temperature. Although some assumptions associated with this new method need to be further validated, application of this dual-isotope approach can provide new insights into the responses of soil carbon dynamics in forest ecosystems to future climate changes.","Elevated CO2; Forest ecosystem; Global warming; Soil respiration; Stable isotopes","carbon dioxide enrichment; forest ecosystem; global warming; soil respiration",,,,,,"Balesdent, J., Girardin, C., Manotti, A., Site-related δ13C of tree-leaves and soil organic matter in a temperate forest (1993) Ecology, 74, pp. 453-462; Berntson, G.M., Woodward, F.I., The root system architecture and development of Senecio vulgaris in elevated CO2 and drought (1992) Functional Ecology, 6, pp. 324-333; Bird, M., Chivas, A.R., Head, J., A latitudinal gradient in carbon turnover times in forest soils (1996) Nature, 381, pp. 143-146; Bootinga, Y., Craig, H., Oxygen isotope fractionation between CO2 and water, and the isotopic composition of marine atmospheric CO2 (1969) Earth and Planetary Science Letters, 5, pp. 285-295; Buchmann, N., Kao, W., Ehleringer, J.R., Influence of stand structure on carbon-13 of vegetation, soils, and canopy air within deciduous and evergreen forests of Utah, United States (1997) Oecologia, 110, pp. 109-119; Cheng, W.X., Measurement of rhizosphere respiration and organic matter decomposition using natural C13 (1996) Plant and Soil, 183, pp. 263-268; Cheng, W.X., Zhang, Q.L., Coleman, D.C., Carroll, C.R., Huffman, C.A., Is available carbon limiting microbial respiration in the rhizosphere?
