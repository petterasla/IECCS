The aim of this study is the examination of risks resulting from activities of the Yazd Combined Cycle Power Plant located in Iran. The method applied in the research is analytical hierarchy process. After identification of factors causing risk, the analytical hierarchy structure of the power plant risks was designed and the weights of the criteria and sub-criteria were calculated by intensity probability product using Eigenvector method and Expert Choice software. Results indicate that in technological, health-safety, biophysical and socioeconomic sections of the power plant, factors influenced by the power plant activities like fire and explosion, hearing loss, quantity of groundwater, power generation are among the most important factors causing risk in the power plant. The drop in underground water levels is the most important natural consequence influenced on Yazd combined cycle power plant.","Analytical hierarchy process; Combined cycle power plant; Environmental risk assessment; Iran; Multi criteria decision making",,,,,,,"Project Management a Systems Approach to Planning, , scheduling and controlling, John Wiley & Sons, New York, 2003; Wright, A.S., Risk and Uncertainty In Construction 2003, , http://www.construction.ualberta.ca; Muhlbauer, W.K., Pipeline Management Manual, 1996, p. 438. , 2 nd ed., Gulf Professional Publishing; Mathews, M.K., Karydas, D.M., Delichatsios, M.A., Fifth International Symposium on Fire Safety Science (1997) International Association For Fire Safety Science, pp. 595-606; Gray, G.M., Toxic Pollution from Powerplants:Large Emissions, Little Risk.Risk in Perspective (1999) Harvard Center For Risk Analysi, p. 7; Akash, B.A., Mamlook, R., Mohsen, M.S., Electr, J., (1999) Pow.
