Protecting coral capacity to respond to the increase in future thermal stress expected with climate change can involve (1) protecting coral reefs with characteristics indicative of greater resistance and resilience to climate change, and (2) reducing other anthropogenic impacts that are more likely to reduce coral resistance and resilience to climate change. Here, we quantitatively compare possible priorities and existing recommendations for protecting coral response capacity to climate change. Specifically, we explore the relative importance of the relevant dynamics, processes, and parameters in a size-structured model of coral and zooxanthellae ecological and evolutionary dynamics given projected future thermal stress. Model results with varying initial conditions indicate that protecting diverse coral communities is critical, and protecting communities with higher abundances of more thermally tolerant coral species and symbiont types secondary, to the long-term maintenance of coral cover. A sensitivity analysis of the coral population size in each size class and the total coral cover with respect to all parameter values suggests greater relative importance of reducing additional anthropogenic impacts that affect coral-macroalgal competition, early coral life history stages, and coral survivorship (compared with reproduction, growth, and shrinkage). Finally, model results with temperature trajectories from different locations, with and without connectivity, indicate that protection of, and connectivity to, low-thermal-stress locations may enhance the capacity for corals to respond to climate change. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Coral bleaching; Coral reefs; Global climate change; Quantitative genetic model; Size-structured matrix model","anthropogenic effect; climate change; climate effect; conservation management; coral bleaching; coral reef; environmental protection; environmental stress; global change; global climate; life history; numerical model; survivorship; theoretical study; Anthozoa",,,,,,"Alleaume-Benharira, M., Pen, I.R., Ronce, O., Geographical patterns of adaptation within a species' range: interactions between drift and gene flow (2006) Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 19, pp. 203-215; Anthony, K.R.N., Connolly, S.R., Hoegh-Guldberg, O., Bleaching, energetics, and coral mortality risk: effects of temperature, light, and sediment regime (2007) Limnology and Oceanography, 52, pp. 716-726; Baghdasarian, G., Muscatine, L., Preferential expulsion of dividing algal cells as a mechanism for regulating algal-cnidarian symbiosis (2000) Biological Bulletin, 199, pp. 278-286; Baird, A.H., Cumbo, V.R., Leggat, W., Rodriguez-Lanetty, M., Fidelity and flexibility in coral symbioses (2007) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 347, pp. 307-309; Bak, R.P., Nieuwland, G., Meesters, E.H., Coral reef crisis in deep and shallow reefs: 30 years of constancy and change in reefs of Curaçao and Bonaire (2005) Coral Reefs, 24, pp. 475-479; Bak, R.P.M., Meesters, E.H., Population structure as a response of coral communities to global change (1999) American Zoologist, 39, pp. 56-65; Baker, A., Symbiont diversity on coral reefs and its relationship to bleaching resistance and resilience (2004) Coral health and Disease, pp. 177-194. , Rosenberg E, Loya Y. eds, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, New York; Baker, A.C., Flexibility and specificity in coral-algal symbiosis: diversity, ecology, and biogeography of Symbiodinium (2003) Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics, 34, pp. 661-689; Baskett, M.L., Gaines, S.D., Nisbet, R.M., Symbiont diversity may help coral reefs survive moderate climate change (2009) Ecological Applications, 19, pp. 3-17; Bellwood, D.R., Hughes, T.P., Folke, C., Nyström, M., Confronting the coral reef crisis (2004) Nature, 429, pp. 827-833; Bhagooli, R., Yakovleva, I., Differential bleaching susceptibility and mortality patterns among four corals in response to thermal stress (2004) Symbiosis, 37, pp. 121-136; Brown, B.E., Adaptations of reef corals to physical environmental stress (1997) Advances in Marine Biology, 31, pp. 221-299; Brown, B.E., Coral bleaching: causes and consequences (1997) Coral Reefs, 16, pp. S129-S138; Brown, B.E., Clarke, K.R., Warwick, R.M., Serial patterns of biodiversity change in corals across shallow reef flats in Ko Phuket, Thailand, due to the effects of local (sedimentation) and regional (climatic) perturbations (2002) Marine Biology, 141, pp. 21-29; Bruno, J.F., Petes, L.E., Harvell, C.D., Hettinger, A., Nutrient enrichment can increase the severity of coral diseases (2003) Ecology Letters, 6, pp. 1056-1061; Burger, R., Evolution of genetic variability and the advantage of sex and recombination in changing environments (1999) Genetics, 153, pp. 1055-1069; Chancerelle, Y., Methods to estimate actual surface areas of scleractinian coral at the colony- and community-scale (2000) Oceanologica Acta, 23, pp. 211-219; Connell, J.H., Hughes, T.P., Wallace, C.C., A 30-year study of coral abundance, recruitment, and disturbance at several scales in space and time (1997) Ecological Monographs, 67, pp. 461-488; Cook, C.B., Logan, A., Ward, J., Luckhurst, B., Berg Jr, C.J., Elevated temperatures and bleaching on a high latitude coral reef: the 1988 Bermuda event (1990) Coral Reefs, 9, pp. 45-49; Day, T., Nagel, L., van Oppen, M.J.H., Caley, M.J., Factors affecting the evolution of bleaching resistance in corals (2008) American Naturalist, 171, pp. E72-E88; de Kroon, H., Plaisier, A., van Groenendael, J., Caswell, H., Elasticity: the relative contribution of demographic parameters to population-growth rate (1986) Ecology, 67, pp. 1427-1431; Done, T.J., Coral community adaptability to environmental change at the scales of regions, reefs and reef zones (1999) American Zoologist, 39, pp. 66-79; Done, T.J., Scientific Principles for Establishing MPAs to Alleviate Coral Bleaching and Promote Recovery (2001) Coral Bleaching and Marine Protected Areas.
