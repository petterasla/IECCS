The region of interest is also known as the Greater Horn of Africa (GHA), and comprises the countries of Burundi, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, Uganda, and Tanzania. The analysis was based primarily on the construction of empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) of gauge rainfall data and on CPC Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP) data, derived from a combination of rain-gauge observations and satellite estimates. The investigation is based on the period 1961-2001 for the 'short rains' season of eastern Africa of October through to December. The EOF analysis was supplemented by projection of National Centers for Environmental Prediction wind data onto the rainfall eigenmodes to understand the rainfall-circulation relationships. Furthermore, correlation and composite analyses have been performed with the Climatic Research Unit globally averaged surface-temperature time series to explore the potential relationship between the climate of eastern Africa and global warming. The most dominant mode of variability (EOF1) based on CMAP data over eastern Africa corresponds to El Niño-southern oscillation (ENSO) climate variability. It is associated with above-normal rainfall amounts during the short rains throughout the entire region, except for Sudan. The corresponding anomalous low-level circulation is dominated by easterly inflow from the Indian Ocean, and to a lesser extent the Congo tropical rain forest, into the positive rainfall anomaly region that extends across most of eastern Africa. The easterly inflow into eastern Africa is part of diffluent outflow from the maritime continent during the warm ENSO events. The second eastern African EOF (trend mode) is associated with decadal variability. In distinct contrast from the ENSO mode pattern, the trend mode is characterized by positive rainfall anomalies over the northern sector of eastern Africa and opposite conditions over the southern sector. This rainfall trend mode eluded detection in previous studies that did not include recent decades of data, because the signal was still relatively weak. The wind projection onto this mode indicates that the primary flow that feeds the positive anomaly region over the northern part of eastern Africa emanates primarily from the rainfall-deficient southern region of eastern Africa and Sudan. Although we do not assign attribution of the trend mode to global warming (in part because of the relatively short period of analysis), the evidence, based on our results and previous studies, strongly suggests a potential connection. © 2004 Royal Meteorological Society.","Climate change; Climate variability; CMAP; Eastern Africa; El Niño-southern oscillation; Greater Horn of Africa; Indian Ocean; Zonal mode","Condensation; Data acquisition; Environmental protection; Rain; Satellites; Eluded detection; Orthogonal; Short rains; Climatology; air-sea interaction; climate change; climate variation; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; rainfall; Africa; East Africa; Indian Ocean; Sub-Saharan Africa",,,,,,"Atwoki, K., A factor analytic approach for the delimitation of the rainfall regions of Uganda (1975) Eastern Africa Geographical Review, 13, pp. 9-36; Basalirwa, C.P.K., Delineation of Uganda into climatological rainfall zones using the method of principal components analysis (1995) International Journal of Climatology, 15, pp. 1161-1177; Basalirwa, C.P.K., Odiyo, J.O., Mngodo, R.J., Mpeta, E.J., The climatological regions of Tanzania based on rainfall characteristics (1999) International Journal of Climatology, 19, pp. 69-80; Black, E., Slingo, J., Sperber, K.R., An observational study of the relationship between excessively strong short rains in coastal East Africa and Indian Ocean SST (2003) Monthly Weather Review, 131, pp. 74-94; Bretherton, C.S., Smith, C., Wallace, J.M., An intercomparison of methods for finding coupled patterns in climate data (1992) Journal of Climate, 5, pp. 541-560; Cadet, D.L., Diehl, B., Interannual variability of the surface field over the Indian Ocean during the recent decades (1984) Monthly Weather Review, 112, pp. 21-25; Cane, M., Zebiak, S.E., Donald, S.C., Experimental forecasts for El Niño (1986) Nature, 321, pp. 702-827; Clark, C.O., Webster, P.J., Cole, J.E., Interdecadal variability of the relationship between the Indian Ocean zonal mode and East African coastal rainfall anomalies (2003) Journal of Climate, 16, pp. 548-554; Conway, D., The climate and hydrology of the Upper Blue Nile, Ethiopia (2000) Geographical Journal, 166, pp. 49-62; Dai, A., Fung, I.Y., Genio, A.D.D., Surface observed global land precipitation variations during 1900-88 (1997) Journal of Climate, 10, pp. 2943-2962; Folland, C.K., Rayner, N.A., Brown, S.J., Smith, T.M., Shen, S.S.P., Parker, D.E., Macadam, I., Sexton, D.M.H., Global temperature change and its uncertainties since 1861 (2001) Geophysical Research Letters, 28, pp. 2621-2624; Goddard, L., Graham, N.E., Importance of the Indian Ocean for simulating rainfall anomalies over eastern and southern Africa (1999) Journal of Geophysical Research, 104, pp. 19099-19116; Hoskins, B.J., Karoly, D., The steady linear response of a spherical atmosphere to thermal and orographic forcing (1981) Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences, 38, pp. 1179-1196; Houghton, J.T., Ding, Y., Griggs, D.J., Noguers, M., van der Linden, P.J., Dai, X., Maskell, K., Johnson, C.A., (2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis, , (eds) Contribution of Working Group I to the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
