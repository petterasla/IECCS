Forecasting their long-term evolution requires models with thoroughly assessed validation. Our aim here is to demonstrate that the sensitivity of such models to climate input characteristics may complicate their validation and introduce uncertainties in their predictions. In this study, we conducted a sensitivity analysis of a process-based tree distribution model Phenofit to climate input characteristics. This analysis was conducted for two North American trees which differ greatly in their distribution and eight different types of climate input for the historic period which differ in their spatial (local or gridded data) and temporal (daily vs. monthly) resolution as well as their type (locally recorded, extrapolated or simulated by General Circulation Models). We show that the climate data resolution (spatial and temporal) and their type, highly affect the model predictions. The sensitivity analysis also revealed, the importance, for global climate change impact assessment, of (i) the daily variability of temperatures in modeling the biological processes shaping species distribution, (ii) climate data at high latitudes and elevations and (iii) climate data with high spatial resolution. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Climate change; General circulation model; Plant distribution; Process-based model; Sensitivity analysis","climate change; general circulation model; population distribution; sensitivity analysis",,,,,,"Aspinall, R.J., Use of logistic regression for validation of maps of the spatial distribution of vegetation species derived from high spatial resolution hyperspectral remotely sensed data (2002) Ecological Modelling, 157, pp. 301-312; Austin, M.P., Continuum concept, ordination methods, and niche theory (1985) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 16, pp. 39-61; Austin, M.P., A silent clash of paradigms: Some inconsistencies in community ecology (1999) Oikos, 86, pp. 170-178; Austin, M.P., Spatial prediction of species distribution: An interface between ecological theory and statistical modelling (2002) Ecological Modelling, 157, pp. 101-118; Bachelet, D., Brugnach, M., Neilson, R.P., Sensitivity of a biogeography model to soil properties (1998) Ecological Modelling, 109, pp. 77-98; Bakkenes, M., Alkemade, J.R.M., Ihle, F., Assessing effects of forecasted climate change on the diversity and distribution of European higher plants for 2050 (2002) Global Change Biology, 8, pp. 390-407; Beaumont, L.J., Hughes, L., Potential changes in the distributions of latitudinally restricted Australian butterfly species in response to climate change (2002) Global Change Biology, 8, pp. 954-971; Berry, P.M., Dawson, T.P., Harrison, P.A., Modelling potential impacts of climate change on the bioclimatic envelope of species in Britain and Ireland (2002) Global Ecology and Biogeography, 11, pp. 453-462; Betts, R.A., Cox, P.M., Lee, S.E., Contrasting physiological and structural vegetation feedbacks in climate change simulations (1997) Nature, 387, pp. 796-799; Brzeziecki, B., Kienast, F., Wildi, O., A simulated map of the potential natural forest vegetation of Switzerland (1993) Journal of Vegetation Science, 4, pp. 499-508; Budyko, M.I., (1974) Climate and Life, , Academic Press, New York, NY; Cannell, M.G.R., Thornley, J.H.M., Mobbs, D.C., UK conifer forests may be growing faster in response to increased N deposition, atmospheric CO2 and temperature (1998) Forestry, 71, pp. 277-296; Chuine, I., Beaubien, E., Phenology is a major determinant of temperate tree distributions (2001) Ecology Letters, 4, pp. 500-510; Critchfield, W.B., Little, E.L.J., (1966) Geographic Distribution of the Pines of the World, p. 97. , Report No. 991.
