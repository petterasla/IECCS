In some countries it is the main waste management option whereas in other countries it has been disregarded. The main discussion point on waste incineration is the release of air emissions from the combustion of the waste, but also the energy recovery efficiency has a large importance.The historical development of air pollution control in waste incineration was studied through life-cycle-assessment modelling of eight different air pollution control technologies. The results showed a drastic reduction in the release of air emissions and consequently a significant reduction in the potential environmental impacts of waste incineration. Improvements of a factor 0.85-174 were obtained in the different impact potentials as technology developed from no emission control at all, to the best available emission control technologies of today (2010).The importance of efficient energy recovery was studied through seven different combinations of heat and electricity recovery, which were modelled to substitute energy produced from either coal or natural gas. The best air pollution control technology was used at the incinerator. It was found that when substituting coal based energy production total net savings were obtained in both the standard and toxic impact categories. However, if the substituted energy production was based on natural gas, only the most efficient recovery options yielded net savings with respect to the standard impacts. With regards to the toxic impact categories, emissions from the waste incineration process were always larger than those from the avoided energy production based on natural gas. The results shows that the potential environmental impacts from air emissions have decreased drastically during the last 35. years and that these impacts can be partly or fully offset by recovering energy which otherwise should have been produced from fossil fuels like coal or natural gas. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Air emissions; Air pollution control technology; Emission control technologies; Energy productions; Energy recovery; Energy recovery efficiency; Heat and electricity; Historical development; Municipal Solid Waste; NO emissions; Recovering energy; Air quality; Coal; Coal combustion; Coal industry; Emission control; Energy conversion; Environmental impact; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Leakage (fluid); Life cycle; Metal recovery; Natural gas; Pollution control; Pollution induced corrosion; Refuse incinerators; Solid wastes; Technology; Toxic materials; Waste management; Waste incineration; fossil fuel; natural gas; atmospheric pollution; environmental impact assessment; incineration; life cycle analysis; modeling; municipal solid waste; pollution control; technological development; waste management; acidification; air pollution control; article; coal power; combustion; controlled study; ecotoxicity; energy conservation; energy recovery; energy yield; environmental impact assessment; greenhouse effect; incineration; intermethod comparison; life cycle assessment; municipal solid waste; priority journal; renewable energy; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Efficiency; Incineration; Power Plants",,"natural gas, 8006-14-2; Air Pollutants",,,,"Astrup, T., (2009), Estimating contents of biogenic and fossil carbon in municipal solid waste.
