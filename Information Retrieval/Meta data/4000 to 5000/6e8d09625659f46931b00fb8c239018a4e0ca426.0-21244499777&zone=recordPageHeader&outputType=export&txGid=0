However, recently, it has become necessary to reduce coke consumption for the direct melting process in order to prevent global warming and reduce maintenance costs. Accordingly, the authors have developed technology for injecting various combustibles through the tuyeres of the direct melting furnace. In particular, combustible dust in the pyrolysis gas dischanged from the furnace lop was focused to reduce coke consumption. In this study, some experiments on combustible dust injection through the tuyeres were carried out by using an experimental plant and a commercial facility. The main results obtained are as follows: (1) Combustible dust injected through the lower tuyeres is consumed by combustion and melting in the furnace. This technology is effective in reducing coke consumption and fly ash. (2) Combustible dust injection through the tuyeres maintains low Pb concentration in the slag even under the condition of low coke ratio. Moreover, combustibility in the combustion chamber is improved, and the generation of dioxins is suppressed.","Coke bed; Dioxins; Gasification; Heavy metal; Injection; Melting furnace; Slag; Waste","Coke bed; Combustible dust; Dioxins; Dust injection; Coke; Combustion; Dust; Fly ash; Furnaces; Gasification; Heavy metals; Lead; Melting furnaces; Particle beam injection; Slags; Solid wastes",,,,,,"Higuchi, S., (2003) Life Environ., 48, p. 15; Nabeshima, Y., (2000) J.
