Precipitation, glacial melt water and river runoff and air temperature increased continuously during the last decades, as did also the water level of inland lakes and the frequency of flood disasters. As a result, the vegetation cover is improved, number of days with sand-dust storms reduced. From the end of the 19th century to the 1970s, the climate was warm and dry, and then changed to warm and wet. The effects on northwest China can be classified into three classes by using the relation between precipitation and evaporation increase. If precipitation increases more than evaporation, runoff increases and lake water levels rise. We identify regions with: (1) notable change, (2) slight change and (3) no change. The future climate for doubled CO2 concentration is simulated in a nested approach with the regional climate model-RegCM2. The annual temperature will increase by 2.7° C and annual precipitation by 25%. The cooling effect of aerosols and natural factors will reduce this increase to 2.0°C and 19% of precipitation. As a consequence, annual runoff may increase by more than 10%. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Climate change; Evaporation; Floods; Precipitation (meteorology); Vegetation; Water; Flood disasters; Glacial melt water; Water cycle; Global warming; carbon dioxide enrichment; climate change; climate modeling; evaporation; global warming; hydrological cycle; lake level; precipitation (climatology); runoff; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Xinjiang Uygur",,,,,,"Bengtsson, L., (1997) Numerical simulation of climate change caused by human activities, 26, pp. 58-65. , Ambio Chinese edition, in Chinese; Gao, X., Zao, Z., Ding, Y., Climate change due to greenhouse effect in China as simulated by a regional climate model (2001) Adv Atmos Sci, 18, pp. 53-66; Gao, X., Zao, Z., Ding, Y., Climate change due to greenhouse effect in Northwest China as simulated by a regional climate model (2003) J Glaciol Geocryol, 25, pp. 165-169. , in Chinese with English abstract; Giorgi, F., Marinucci, M.R., Bates, G.T., Development of a second generation regional climatic model (Reg CM2) I and II (1993) Monthly Weather Rev, 121, pp. 2791-2832; Gordon, H.B., Farrell, R.O., Transient climate change in the CSIRO coupled with dynamic sea ice (1997) Monthly Weather Rev, 125, pp. 875-907; Guo, N., Zhang, J., Liang, Y., Climate change indicated by the recent change of inland lakes in Northwest China (2003) J Glaciol Geocryol, 25, pp. 211-214. , in Chinese with English abstract; Hu, R., Ma, H., Fan, Z., Climate Trend indicated by lake variation in Xinjiang (2002) Res Environ Arid Regions, 16, pp. 20-27. , in Chinese with English abstract; Huang, J., Mao, W., Li, Y., Wang, S., Flash Flood event of July, 2002 in Weigan River watershed, Xinjiang (2003) China J Glaciol Geocryol, 25, pp. 204-310. , in Chinese with English abstract; IPCC, Climate Change (2001) In: Houghton et al.
