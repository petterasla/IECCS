However, there is no ""silver bullet,"" and each energy-producing system produces waste. This issue of Elements shows the importance of mineralogy and geochemistry in the safe management and disposal of the different types of waste generated by the nuclear fuel cycle.","Actinides; Nuclear power; Radioactivity; Spent nuclear fuel; Uranium minerals; Waste forms","fossil fuel; geochemistry; global warming; mineralogy; nuclear power; radioactive waste; radioactivity; uranium; waste disposal",,,,,,"Ahearne, J.F., Radioactive waste: The size of the problem (1997) Physics Today, 50, pp. 24-29; Ansolabehere, S., Driscoll, M., (2003) The Future of Nuclear Power: An Interdisciplinary MIT Study, , http://web.mit.edu/nuclearpower, MIT, 161 pp; Cardis E and 17 coauthors (2006) Estimates of the cancer burden In Europe from radioactive fallout from the Chernobyl accident.
