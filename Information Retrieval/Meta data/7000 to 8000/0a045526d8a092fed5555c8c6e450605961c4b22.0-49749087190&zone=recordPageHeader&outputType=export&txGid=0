Protocol definitions from carbon registries help organizations analyze their footprints. The scope of these protocols varies but generally suggests estimating only direct emissions and emissions from purchased energy, with less focus on supply chain emissions. In contrast, approaches based on comprehensive environmental life-cycle assessment methods are available to track total emissions across the entire supply chain, and experience suggests that following narrowly defined estimation protocols will generally lead to large underestimates of carbon emissions for providing products and services. Direct emissions from an industry are, on average, only 14% of the total supply chain carbon emissions (often called Tier 1 emissions), and direct emissions plus industry energy inputs are, on average, only 26% of the total supply chain emissions (often called Tier 1 and 2 emissions). Without a full knowledge of their footprints, firms will be unable to pursue the most cost-effective carbon mitigation strategies. We suggest that firms use the screening-level analysis described here to set the bounds of their footprinting strategy to ensure that they do not ignore large sources of environmental effects across their supply chains. Such information can help firms pursue carbon and environmental emission mitigation projects not only within their own plants but also across their supply chain. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon emissions; Carbon mitigation; Direct emissions; Energy inputs; Environmental effects; Environmental life-cycle; Foot printing; Global climate changes; Mitigation projects; Products and services; Supply chain emissions; Total emissions; Air pollution; Alternative fuels; Carbon; Climate change; Climate control; Climatology; Cost effectiveness; Environmental engineering; Estimation; Laws and legislation; Life cycle; Supply chain management; Supply chains; carbon; carbon emission; climate change; cost-benefit analysis; environmental economics; estimation method; global climate; industrial emission; life cycle analysis; mitigation; strategic approach; assay; climate change; cost effectiveness analysis; energy; environment; global climate; industry; information; knowledge; life cycle assessment; organization; register; screening; short survey; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Carbon; Environmental Monitoring; Greenhouse Effect; Industry",,"carbon, 7440-44-0; Air Pollutants; Carbon, 7440-44-0",,,,"Climate Change 2007 (2007) Synthesis Report, pp. 1-24. , IPCC, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change: Valencia, Spain; Lash, J., Wellington, F., Competitive Advantage on a Warming Planet (2007) Harvard Bus.
