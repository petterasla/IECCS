Bhutan's National Environment Strategy has identified intersectoral contradictions and possible synergies in resource utilization and the need for institutional reforms, policies, manpower development, information, and legislation to achieve the goal of balanced sustainable development. The challenge ahead is the implementation of this strategy, as environmental regulations must be fitted into the society's economic and social structure. While promoting economic development, preservation of the environment can easily become a liability to Bhutan. There is the great danger that Bhutan's unique environment will come to be seen by other nations as just another unexploited asset.",,"developing country; economic development; economic growth; environment and development; environmental economics; environmental management; environmental protection; mountain environment; Bhutan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031464490
