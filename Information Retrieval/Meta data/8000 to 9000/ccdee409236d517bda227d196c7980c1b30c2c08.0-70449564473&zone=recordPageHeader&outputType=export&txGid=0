Better understanding of how nutrient conservation changes with variations in water availability is crucial for predicting the potential influence of global climate change on plant nutrient-use strategy. Here, green-leaf nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations, N- and P-resorption proficiency (the terminal N and P concentration in senescent leaves, NRP and PRP, respectively), and N- and P-resorption efficiency (the proportional N and P withdrawn from senescent leaves prior to abscission, NRE and PRE, respectively) of Leymus chinensis (Trin.) Tzvel., a typical perennial grass species in northern China, were examined along a water supply gradient to explore how plant nutrient conservation responds to water change. Increasing water supply at low levels (< 9000 mL/year) increased NRP, PRP and PRE, but decreased green-leaf N concentration. It did not significantly affect green-leaf P concentration or NRE. By contrast, all N and P conservation indicators were not significantly influenced at high water supply levels (> 9000 mL/year). These results indicated that changes in water availability at low levels could affect leaf-level nutrient characteristics, especially for the species in semiarid ecosystems. Therefore, global changes in precipitation may pose effects on plant nutrient economy, and thus on nutrient cycling in the plant-soil systems. 2009 Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.","Green-leaf nutrient concentration; Leymus chinensis; Nutrient conservation; Nutrient resorption; Water supply gradient","nitrogen; phosphorus; rain; water; climate change; climate effect; ecosystem response; grass; nitrogen cycle; nutrient availability; phosphorus cycle; resorption; semiarid region; soil water; water availability; absorption; article; biomass; cell aging; cytology; metabolism; plant leaf; Poaceae; soil; Absorption; Biomass; Cell Aging; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Plant Leaves; Poaceae; Rain; Soil; Water; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Leymus chinensis",,"nitrogen, 7727-37-9; phosphorus, 7723-14-0; water, 7732-18-5; Nitrogen, 7727-37-9; Phosphorus, 7723-14-0; Soil; Water, 7732-18-5",,,,"Aerts, R., Nutrient resorption from senescing leaves of perennials: are there general patterns?
