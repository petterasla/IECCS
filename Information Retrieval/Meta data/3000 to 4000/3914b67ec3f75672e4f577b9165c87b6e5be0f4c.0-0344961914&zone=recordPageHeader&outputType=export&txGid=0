These poleward shifts were correlated to local increases in minimum winter temperatures and global temperature anomalies. This evidence, plus other recent results, suggests that during the last two decades global warming has led to massive and widespread biogeographic shifts with potentially major ecological and human consequences. Local habitat changes associated with urban sprawl affected mainly forest birds with more northern winter distributions. In Cape Cod, the effects of warming on bird distributions are more substantial at the start of the 21st century, than those of habitat alteration, but as urban sprawl continues its importance may rival that of global warming.",,"bird; global warming; population distribution; temperature effect; winter; animal; article; bird; city; environment; environmental monitoring; greenhouse effect; population dynamics; season; United States; Animals; Birds; Cities; Environment; Environmental Monitoring; Greenhouse Effect; Massachusetts; Population Dynamics; Seasons; North America; United States; Animalia; Aves; Gadus morhua; Vertebrata",,,,,,"Vitousek, P.M., Mooney, H.A., Lubchenco, J., Melillo, J.M., Human domination of earth's ecosystems (1997) Science, 277, pp. 494-499; Houghton, J.T., Meira Filho, L.G., Callander, B.A., Harris, N., Kattenberg, A., Meskell, K., (1996) Climate Change 1995: The Science of Climate Change, , Cambridge University Press; McCarthy, J.J., Canziani, O.F., Leary, N.A., Dokken, J., White, K.S., (2001) Climate Change 2001: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability, , Cambridge Univ.
