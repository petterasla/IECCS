The methodology is applied to the two largest sources of energy-related carbon dioxide: electricity generation and motor vehicles. Carbon-free road transportation is hypothesized to substitute for petroleum-fueled vehicles and carbon-free electric power generation for fossil-fueled electricity based on empirical analogs for substitution dynamics parameters, beginning in the year 2000. The examples imply that near-term significant reductions to 1990 carbon emissions levels via technology substitution are unlikely. The time scale relevant for realizing reductions in carbon emissions is several times the expected lifetime of the products that new technology is intended to replace.",,"Automotive fuels; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Electric power generation; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas emissions; Industrial emissions; Motor transportation; Petroleum products; Technology transfer; Energy technology; Energy resources",,,,,,"Austin, D., (1997) Climate Protection Policies: Can We Afford to Delay?, , World Resources Institute, Washington, D.C; Ausubel, J., Marchetti, C., Elektron: Electrical Systems in Retrospect and Prospect (1996) Daedelus, 125 (3), pp. 139-169; Bass, P.M., A New Product Growth Model for Consumer Durables (1969) Management Science, 15 (5), pp. 215-227; Beaver, R., (1992) A Structural Comparison of Models Used in EMF 12 to Analyze the Costs of Policies for Reducing Energy-Sector CO2 Emissions, , EMF Forum Working Paper WP 12.28, Stanford University, Stanford, CA; De Vries, B., Janssen, M., (1996) Global Energy: An Integrated Perspective with the TIME Model, , GLOBO report series No. 17, RIVM, Bilthoven; (1997) 97 Handbook of Energy & Economic Statistics in Japan, , The Energy Data and Modelling Center: The Institute of Energy Economics, Japan.
