Global climate change scenarios suggest corn productivity in Zimbabwe will decrease dramatically under non-irrigated or irrigated conditions in some regions. The reductions in corn yields are primarily attributed to ambient temperature increases which shorten the crop growth period, particularly the grain-filling period. If climate effects occur farmers may find corn production an unacceptably risky activity. Adaptation options are available but financial costs may be prohibitive to communal area farmers. -from Author",,"climate change; maize production; yield decline; Zimbabwe",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029769385
