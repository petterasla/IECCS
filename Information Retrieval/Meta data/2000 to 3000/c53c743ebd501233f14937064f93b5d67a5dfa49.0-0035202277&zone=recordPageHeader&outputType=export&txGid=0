Emissions were measured during the spring thaw, in summer and in autumn. No effect of water table position on CH4 emission was found as the water table remained at or above the surface of the peat. Methane emission fluxes increased with surface temperature from which an activation energy of -99 kJ mol-1 was obtained. Annual emission from the site, modelled from temperature regression and short-term flux measurements made in three separate years, was calculated to be 5.5 ± 0.4 g CH4 m-2 y-1 of which 0.6 ± 0.1 g CH4 m-2 y-1 (11%) was released during the spring thaw which lasted 20 to 30 days. The effect of global warming on the CH4 budget of the site was estimated using the central scenario of the SILMU (Finnish Research Programme on Climate Change) model which predicts annual mean temperature increases of 1.2, 2.4 and 4.4 °C in 2020, 2050 and 2100, respectively. Maximum enhancements in CH4 emission due to warming were calculated to be 18, 40 and 84% for 2020, 2050 and 2100, respectively. Actual increases may be smaller because prediction of changes in water table are highly uncertain.",,"biogenic emission; methane; mire; water table; Finland",,,,,,"Aurela, M., Laurila, T., Tuovinen, J.-P., Seasonal CO2 balances on a subartctic mire (2001) J Geophys Res, 106, pp. 1623-1637; Carter, T., Posch, M., Tuomenvirta, H., (1995) Guidelines for the Construction of Climate Scenarios and Use of a Stochastic Weather Generator in the Finnish Research Programme on Climate Change (SILMU); Christensen, T.R., Jonasson, S., Callaghan, T.V., Havstrom, M., Livens, F.R., Carbon cycling and methane exchange in Eurasian tundra ecosystems (1999) Ambio, 28 (3), pp. 239-244; Dise, N.B., Gorham, E., Verry, E.S., Environmental factors controlling methane emissions from peatlands in Northern Minnesota (1993) J Geophys Res, 98 (6 D), pp. 10583-10594; Edwards, G.C., Neumann, H.H., den Hartog, G., Thurtell, G.W., Kidd, G., Eddy correlation measurements of CH4 using a tunable diode laser at Kinosheo Lake tower site during the Northern Wetlands Study (NOWES) (1994) J Geophys Res, 99, pp. 1511-1518; Fan, S.M., Wofsy, S.C., Bakwin, P.S., Jacob, D.J., Anderson, S.M., Kebabian, P.L., McManus, J.B., Kolb, C.E., Micrometeorological measurements of CH4 and CO2 exchange between the atmosphere and subarctic tundra (1992) J Geophys Res, 97, pp. 16627-16643; Fowler, D., Hargreaves, K.J., Skiba, U., Milne, R., Zahniser, M.S., Moncrieff, J.B., Beverland, I.J., Gallagher, M.W., Measurements of CH4 and N2O fluxes at the landscape scale using micrometeorological methods (1995) Phil Trans Roy Soc Lond A, 351, pp. 339-356; Friborg, T., Christensen, T.R., Soegaard, H., Rapid response of greenhouse gas emission to early spring thaw in a subarctic mire as shown by micrometeorological techniques (1997) Geophys Res Lett, 24 (23), pp. 3061-3064; Friborg, T., Christensen, T.R., Hansen, B.U., Nordstrøm, C., Søgaard, H., Trace gas exchange in a high arctic valley 2: Landscape CH4 fluxes measured and modelled using eddy correlation data (1999) Global Biogeochemical Cycles, , In press; Hargreaves, K.J., Fowler, D., Quantifying the effects of soil temperature and water table on the emission of methane from peat wetland at the field scale (1998) Atmos Environ, 32, pp. 3275-3282; Harriss, R.C., Sachse, G.W., Hill, G.F., Wade, L., Bartlett, K.B., Collins, J.E., Steele, P., Novelli, P., Carbon dioxide and methane in the North American Arctic and subarctic troposphere: July-August 1988 (1992) J Geophys Res, 97, pp. 16589-16600; Hein, R., Crutzen, P.J., Heimann, M., An inverse modelling approach to investigate the global atmospheric methane cycle (1997) Global Biogeochem.
