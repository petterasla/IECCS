These arthropod-borne viruses can cause disease in different domestic and wild animals and in humans, posing a threat to public health because of their epidemic and zoonotic potential. In recent decades, the geographical distribution of these diseases has expanded. Outbreaks of WNF have already occurred in Europe, especially in the Mediterranean basin. Moreover, CCHF is endemic in many European countries and serious outbreaks have occurred, particularly in the Balkans, Turkey and Southern Federal Districts of Russia. In 2000, RVF was reported for the first time outside the African continent, with cases being confirmed in Saudi Arabia and Yemen. This spread was probably caused by ruminant trade and highlights that there is a threat of expansion of the virus into other parts of Asia and Europe. In the light of global warming and globalisation of trade and travel, public interest in emerging zoonotic diseases has increased. This is especially evident regarding the geographical spread of vector-borne diseases. A multi-disciplinary approach is now imperative, and groups need to collaborate in an integrated manner that includes vector control, vaccination programmes, improved therapy strategies, diagnostic tools and surveillance, public awareness, capacity building and improvement of infrastructure in endemic regions.",,"Africa; animal; article; Asia; bovids; commercial phenomena; communicable disease; disease transmission; endemic disease; Europe; health education; health survey; hemorrhagic fever; human; international cooperation; mosquito; organization and management; parasite vector; virus hemorrhagic fever; virus infection; zoonosis; Africa; Animals; Arbovirus Infections; Arthropod Vectors; Asia; Commerce; Communicable Diseases, Emerging; Endemic Diseases; Europe; Health Education; Hemorrhagic Fever, Crimean; Humans; International Agencies; Mosquito Control; Population Surveillance; Rift Valley Fever; Ruminants; West Nile Fever; Zoonoses",,,,,,,"Ahmed, J.",,,,,,,,15607917,,,19341603,"English","Euro Surveill.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-67149131638
