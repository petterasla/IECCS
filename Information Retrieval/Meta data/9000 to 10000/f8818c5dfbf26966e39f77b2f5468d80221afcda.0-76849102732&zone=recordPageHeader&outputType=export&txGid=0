Grain size, carbonate percentage, magnetic susceptibility, amount of charcoal, and diatom community composition data were collected from the 16 lacustrine units that compose the 122 cm stratigraphic column in Stansbury Gulch. Trends observed in the measured proxies reveal several significant changes in lake level, and thereby effective moisture, over the approximately 14,500 yr time span represented by the sediments. Results (1) verify the effectiveness of the multiproxy approach in Bonneville basin studies, which has been underutilized in this region, (2) reaffirm the double nature of Lake Bonneville's Stansbury oscillation, (3) suggest a previously undocumented post-Gilbert highstand of Great Salt Lake, and (4) identify possible teleconnections between climate events in the Bonneville basin and events in the North Atlantic at about 20,500 and 7500 14C yr BP. © 2009 University of Washington.","Great Basin; Great Salt Lake; Lake Bonneville; Multiple proxy; Paleoclimate; Paleolake chronology; Stansbury Gulch; Stansbury Island; Stansbury oscillation; Stansbury shoreline","chronology; lacustrine deposit; lake level; paleoclimate; paleoenvironment; paleohydrology; paleolimnology; Pleistocene-Holocene boundary; proxy climate record; radiocarbon dating; teleconnection; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Bonneville Basin; Great Basin; Great Salt Lake; United States; Utah; Bacillariophyta",,,,,,"Alley, R.B., Mayewski, A., Sowers, T., Stuiver, M., Taylor, K.C., Clark, U., Holocene climatic instability: a prominent, widespread event 8200 yr ago (1997) Geology, 25, pp. 483-486; Benson, L.V., Paillet, F.L., The use of total lake-surface area as an indicator of climatic change: examples from the Lahontan basin (1989) Quaternary Research, 32, pp. 262-275; Benson, L.V., Currey, D.R., Lao, Y., Hostetler, S., Lake-size variations in the Lahontan and Bonneville basins between 13,000 and 9000 14C yr B.P (1992) Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 95, pp. 19-32; Bischoff, J.L., Fitts, J.P., Fitzpatrick, J.A., Responses of sediment geochemistry to climate change in Owens Lake sediment: an 800-k.y. record of saline/fresh cycles in core OL-92 (1997) Geological Society of America Special Paper, 317, pp. 37-48; Bond, G., Broecker, W., Johnsen, S., McManus, J., Labeyrie, L., Jouzel, J., Bonani, G., Correlations between climate records from North Atlantic sediments and Greenland ice (1993) Nature, 365, pp. 143-147; Bond, G., Heinrich, H., Broecker, W., Labeyrie, L., McManus, J., Andrews, J., Huon, S., Tedesco, K., Evidence for massive discharge of icebergs into the North Atlantic Ocean during the last glacial period (1992) Nature, 360, pp. 245-249; Bradbury, J., A diatom-based paleohydrologic record of climate change for the past 800 k.y. from Owens Lake, California (1997) Geological Society of America Special Paper, 317, pp. 99-112; Broecker, W.S., Massive iceberg discharges as triggers for global climate change (1994) Nature, 372, pp. 421-424; Brunelle, A., Whitlock, C., Postglacial fire, vegetation, and climate history in the Clearwater Range, northern Idaho, USA (2003) Quaternary Research, 60, pp. 307-318; Brunelle, A., Whitlock, C., Bartlein, P.J., Kipfmueller, K., Holocene fire and vegetation along environmental gradients in the northern Rocky Mountains (2005) Quaternary Science Reviews, 24, pp. 2281-2300; Burr, T.N., Currey, D.R., The Stockton Bar (1988) Utah Geological Survey Miscellaneous Publication, 88-1, pp. 66-73; Clark, J.S., Particle motion and the theory of charcoal analysis: source area, transport, deposition, and sampling (1988) Quaternary Research, 30, pp. 67-80; Cumming, B.F., Wilson, S.E., Hall, R.I., Smol, J., Diatoms from British Columbia (Canada) Lakes and their Relationship to Salinity (1995) Nutrients and Other Limnological Variables, , J.
