TMCF are among the most threatened of ecosystems under current predicted global warming scenarios. We conducted an intensive soil sampling campaign extending 40 km along the tree line in the Peruvian Andes between 2994 and 3860 m asl to quantify SOC stocks of TMCF, puna grassland, and shrubland sites in the transition zone between the two habitats. SOC stocks from the soil surface down to the bedrock averaged (±standard error SE) 11. 8 (±1.5, N = 24) kg C/m2 in TMCF, 14.7 (±1.4, N = 9) kg C/m2 in the shrublands and 11.9 (±0.8, N = 35) kg C/m2 in the grasslands and were not significantly different (P &gt; 0.05 for all comparisons). However, soil profile analysis revealed distinct differences, with TMCF profiles showing a uniform SOC distribution with depth, shrublands a linear decrease, and puna sites an exponential decrease in SOC densities with soil depth. Organic soil layer thickness reached a maximum (~70 cm) at the upper limit of the TMCF and declined with increasing altitude toward puna sites. Within TMCF, no significant increase in SOC stocks with increasing altitude was observed, probably because of the large variations among SOC stocks at different sites, which in turn were correlated with spatial variation in soil depth. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Puna; Soil carbon stocks; Tree line; Tropical montane cloud forest","cloud forest; global warming; grassland; shrubland; soil carbon; soil depth; soil organic matter; soil profile; treeline; Andes; Peru; Puna",,,,,,"Arteaga, A., Calderón, G.N.E., Krasilnikov, P.V., Sedov, S.N., Targulian, V.O., Velázquez, R.N., Soil altitudinal sequence on base-poor parent material in a montane cloud forest in Sierra Juárez, southern Mexico (2008) Geoderma, 144, pp. 593-612; Bernoux, M., Cerri, C., Arrouays, D., Jolivet, C., Volkoff, B., Bulk densities of Brazilian Amazon soils related to other soil properties (1998) Soil Sci Soc Am J, 62, pp. 743-749; Bush, M.B., Silman, M.R., Urrego, D.H., 48,000 years of climate and forest change in a biodiversity hotspot (2004) Science, 303, pp. 827-829; Calhoun, F.G., Smeck, N.E., Slater, B.L., Bigham, J.M., Hall, G.F., Predicting bulk density of Ohio soils from morphology, genetic principles, and laboratory characterization data (2001) Soil Sci Soc Am J, 65, pp. 811-819; Colwell, R.K., Brehm, G., Cardelus, C.L., Gilman, A.C., Longino, J.T., Global warming, elevational range shifts, and lowland biotic attrition in the wet tropics (2008) Science, 322, pp. 258-261; Cramer, W., Bondeau, A., Schaphoff, S., Lucht, W., Smith, B., Sitch, S., Tropical forests and the global carbon cycle: Impacts of atmospheric carbon dioxide, climate change and rate of deforestation (2004) Tellus B, 359, pp. 331-343; Foster, P., The potential negative impacts of global climate change on tropical montane cloud forests (2001) Earth Sci Rev, 55, pp. 73-106; Gräfe, S., Hertel, D., Leuschner, C., Estimating fine root turnover in tropical forests along an elevational Transect using minirhizotrons (2008) Biotropica, 40, pp. 536-542; Harris, W.N., Moretto, A.S., Distel, R.A., Boutton, T.W., Bóo, R.M., Fire and grazing in grasslands of the Argentine Caldenal: Effects on plant and soil carbon and nitrogen (2007) Acta Oecol, 32, pp. 207-214; Heuscher, S.A., Brandt, C.C., Jardine, P.M., Using soil physical and chemical properties to estimate bulk density (2005) Soil Sci Soc Am J, 69, pp. 51-56; Hofstede, R.G.M., The effects of grazing and burning on soil and plant nutrient concentrations in Colombian páramo grasslands (1995) Plant Soil, 173, pp. 111-132; Houghton, R.A., Revised estimates of the annual net flux of carbon to the atmosphere from changes in land use and land management 1850-2000 (2003) Tellus B, 55, pp. 378-390; Janzen, H.H., Carbon cycling in earth systems-a soil science perspective (2004) Agric Ecosyst Environ, 104, pp. 399-417; Jobbagy, E.G., Jackson, R.B., The vertical distribution of soil organic carbon and its relation to climate and vegetation (2000) Ecol Appl, 10, pp. 423-436; Kok, K., Verweij, P.A., Beukema, H., Effects of cutting and grazing in Andean treeline vegetation (1995) Biodiversity and Conservation of Neotropical Monatne Forests, pp. 527-539. , S.
