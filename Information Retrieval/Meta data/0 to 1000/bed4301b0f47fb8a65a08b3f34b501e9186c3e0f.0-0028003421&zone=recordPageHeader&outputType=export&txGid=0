The approach is being applied in the Mackenzie Basin of Canada. The study focuses on the identification and specification of regional policy concerns relating to climate change. The approach attempts to ensure that the outputs of the climate change impact study reflect some major concerns of various regional 'stake holders'. © 1994.",,"analytical hierarchy process; climate change; climatic change; global climate change; goal programming; planning technique; policy; policy concern; regional policy; regional stake holders; Canada, Mackenzie District, Northwest Territories; Canada, Northwest Territories, Mackenzie Basin",,,,,,"Burton, Cohen, Adapting to global warming: regional options (1992) paper presented at the International Conference on Impacts of Climate Variations and Sustainable Development in Semi-Arid Regions Development in Semi-A, , Fortaleza, Brazil; Carter, Parry, Nishioka, Harasawa, (1992) Preliminary Guidelines for Assessing Impacts of Climate Change, , Environmental Change Unit and Center for Global Environmental Research, Working Group II of The International Panel on Climate Change; Chen, Parry, (1987) Policy Oriented Impact Assessment of Climatic Variations, , International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, Laxenburg, RR-87-7; IPCC, (1991) Climate Change: The IPCC Response Strategies, , Island Press, Washington, DC; Yin, Cohen, Methodology for integrated climate change impact assessment (1993) Mackenzie Basin Impact Study Interim Report, , S.J.
