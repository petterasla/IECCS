Seedlings are most responsive; in many cases, the first few weeks or months of exposure may set the pattern for future growth. Measurements of leaf photosynthesis and respiration are not good predictors for incorporation of carbon into tissue. Seasonal changes in non-structural carbohydrates, emissions of isoprenes from leaves and exudation from roots can ""waste' photosynthate, but these are difficult or impossible to quantify. The only generalization that can be made is that growth will be accelerated but the magnitude of this depends on tissue type, nutrition and environmental conditions. The implications of this for a future elevated atmospheric CO2 world are complex. -from Authors",,"carbon dioxide enrichment; isoprene; non-structural carbohydrate; photosynthate",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029530064
