This freon is non-ozone-depleting but has a high global warming potential (1300 times higher than that of CO2). Thus freon gases might be unusable in the near future. We tested the performance of a glass resistive plate counter operated in the streamer mode with an alternative gas mixtures of argon, butane, CO2, and/or O2 gases and found an efficiency of about 90%.","Particle detector; Resistive plate counter; RPC SF6; Streamer","Argon; Butane; Carbon dioxide; Freons; Gas detectors; Glass; Mixtures; Oxygen; Gas mixture; Glass resistive plate counter; Sulfur hexafluoride; Particle detectors",,,,,,"Santonico, R., Cardarelli, R., Development of resistive plate counters (1981) Nucl.
