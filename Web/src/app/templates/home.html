  <h1>Interactive Exploration of Consensus in Climate Science</h1>
  <p>
    This single page web aplication presents the result of our research on stance detection in scientific literature.
    The topic of the literature in question is anthropogenic (human-induced) global warming.
    We have based our research ont The Consensus Project (TCP). TCP manually examined 11,944 climate abstracts related
    to anthropogenic global warming and classified the papers' stances. The work of TCP is extensive and
    time consuming. The material presented here is the result of our exploration of automating their work and classify
    stance using machine learning on global warming literature after 2011.
    The findings of TCP have been used as training and testing foundation for our work.
