A coupled atmosphere-surface feedback analysis is formulated to isolate the direct response to an anthropogenic greenhouse gas forcing from individual local feedbacks (water vapor, evaporation, surface sensible heat flux, and ice-albedo), and from the non-local dynamical feedback. Both the direct response and response to water vapor feedback are stronger in low latitudes. The joint effect of the ice-albedo and dynamical greenhouse-plus feedbacks acts to amplify the high latitude surface warming whereas both the evaporation and dynamical greenhouse-minus feedbacks cause a reduction of the surface warming in low latitudes. The enhancement (reduction) of local feedbacks in high (low) latitudes in response to the non-local dynamic feedback further strengthens the polar amplification of the surface warming. Both the direct response and response to water vapor feedback lead to an increase of lapse rate in both low and high latitudes. The stronger total dynamic heating in the mean state in high latitudes is responsible for a larger increase of lapse rate in high latitudes in the direct response and response to water vapor feedback. The local evaporation and surface sensible heat flux feedbacks reduce the lapse rate both in low and high latitudes through cooling the surface and warming the atmosphere. The much stronger evaporation feedback leads to a final warming in low latitudes that is stronger in the atmosphere than the surface. © Springer-Verlag 2007.",,"albedo; climate change; evaporation; global warming; greenhouse gas; sensible heat flux; water vapor",,,,,,"Alexeev, V.A., Langen, P.L., Bates, J.R., Polar amplification of surface warming on an aquaplanet in ""ghost forcing"" experiments without sea ice feedbacks (2005) Clim Dyn, 24, pp. 655-666; Bates, J.R., A dynamical stabilizer in the climate system: A mechanism suggested by a simple model (1999) Tellus, 51 A, pp. 349-372; Bony, S., How well do we understand and evaluate climate change feedback processes?
