Different warming trends were found for the different seasons: the extent of warming is stronger and more widespread in winter than in summer. Warming is more pronounced at higher latitude, particularly in winter. The possible mechanisms of seasonal variation in climate warming include effects of greenhouse gases, increased cloud cover due to increases in sulfate aerosols, and local processes such as changes in land use and urban heat island effects. © Inter-Research 2005.","Global warming; Mechanism; Regional structure; Seasonal variation","climate change; global warming; seasonal variation; Asia; China; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Far East; World",,,,,,"An, Z., Wu, X., Lu, Y., Primary study on environmental evolvement in the recent 20 ka (1990) Loess, the Quaternary Geology and Global Change, 2, pp. 1-26. , Liu D (ed) Science Press, Bingjing, (in Chinese); Birchfield, G.E., Wertman, J., Topography, albedo-temperature feedback, and climate sensitivity (1983) Science, 219, pp. 284-285; Chapman, W., Walsh, J., Recent variations of sea ice and air temperature in high latitudes (1993) Bull.
