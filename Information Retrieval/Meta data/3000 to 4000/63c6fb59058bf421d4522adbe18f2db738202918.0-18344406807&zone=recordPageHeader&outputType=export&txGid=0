They constitute an area of 13203.2 km2, accounting for 22.2% of China's total glaciated area. Such glaciers are extremely sensitive to climatic warming due to their unique characters. An inconsiderable rise in air temperature may lead to a significant rise in ELA and a large shrinkage in glacier area. Since the maximum of the Little Ice Age (17th century) the mean temperature of monsoonal temperate glaciers in China has increased by 0.8°C and the glacier area has decreased by 3921.2 km2, an amount equivalent to 30% of the modern glacier area. It is predicted that by the year 2100 the temperature in the monsoonal temperate glaciers of China will rise by 2.1°C, the glacier area will decrease by 75%, approximately 9900 km2. If the precipitation decreases, the retreat of the glaciers will be even faster, but the area reduction percentage of the glaciers will not exceed 80%. This will no doubt pose a serious threat to the water resources and environment in these regions. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd and INQUA.
