This study uses model output to extend recently reported observational results to multi-century time scales. Nine ensemble members are used in two Global Climate Models with forcing evolving from pre-industrial conditions through the so-called A1B scenario in which carbon dioxide stabilizes at 720 ppm by 2100. Throughout, the NAO generates an east-west dipole pattern of sea ice concentration (SIC) anomalies with oppositely signed centers of action over the Labrador and Barents Seas. During the positive polarity of the NAO, SIC increases over the Labrador Sea due to wind-driven equatorward advection of ice, and SIC decreases over the Barents Sea due to wind-driven poleward transport of heat within the mixed layer of the ocean. Although this NAO-driven SIC variability pattern can always be detected, it accounts for a markedly varying fraction of the total sea ice variability depending on the strength of the forced sea ice extent trend. For the first half of the 20th century or 1990 control conditions, the NAO-driven SIC pattern accounts for almost a third of the total SIC variance. In the context of the long term winter sea ice retreat from 1860 to 2300, the NAO-driven SIC pattern is robustly observable, but accounts for only 2% of the total SIC variance. The NAO-driven SIC dipole retreats poleward with the retreating marginal ice zone, and its Barents Sea center of action weakens. Results presented here underscore the idea that the NAO's influence on Arctic climate is robustly observable, but time dependent in its form and statistical importance. © The Author(s) 2009.","Annular mode; Climate change; Global warming; North Atlantic Oscillation; Sea ice","climate change; climate forcing; climate modeling; marginal ice zone; North Atlantic Oscillation; sea ice; winter; Arctic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean; Barents Sea; Labrador Sea",,,,,,"Alexander, M.A., Bhatt, U.S., Walsh, J.E., Timlin, M.S., Miller, J.S., Scott, J.D., The atmospheric response to realistic Arctic sea ice anomalies in an AGCM during winter (2004) J Clim, 17, pp. 890-905; Arzel, O., Fichefet, T., Goose, H., Sea ice evolution over the 20th and 21st centuries as simulated by current AOGCMs (2006) Ocean Model, 12, pp. 401-415; Cavalieri, D.J., A link between Fram Strait sea ice export and atmospheric planetary wave phase (2002) Geophys Res Lett 29, , doi: 10. 1029/2002GL014684; Comiso, J.C., Abrupt decline in arctic winter sea ice cover Geophys Res Lett 33, , doi: 10. 1029/2006GL027341; Dai, A., Hu, A., Heehl, G.A., Washington, W.M., Strand, W.G., Atlantic thermohaline circulation in a coupled general circulation model: Unforced variations versus forced changes (2005) J Clim, 18, pp. 3270-3293; Deser, C., On the teleconnectivity of the ""Arctic Oscillation"" (2000) Geophys Res Lett, 27, pp. 779-782; Deser, C., Teng, H., Evolution of Arctic sea ice concentration trends and the role of atmospheric circulation forcing, 1979-2007 (2008) Geophys Res Lett 35, , doi: 10. 1029/2007GL032023; Deser, C., Magnusdottir, G., Saravanan, R., Phillips, A.S., The effects of North Atlantic SST and sea-ice anomalies on the winter circulation in CCM3.
