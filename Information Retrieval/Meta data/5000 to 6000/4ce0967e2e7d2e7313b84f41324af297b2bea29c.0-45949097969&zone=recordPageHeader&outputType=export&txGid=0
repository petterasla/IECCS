Annual variations of hydrometeorological conditions were found to have been predetermined not by a steady increase or decrease of one parameter but by their variations within seasons. Therefore the present paper deals with the long-term seasonal Baltic Sea level fluctuations near the Lithuanian coast. Mean monthly values of sea level measured in the port of Klaipeda were chosen for detailed analysis of sea level fluctuations in the Baltic Sea. The long-term dynamic pattern of mean sea level fluctuations near Klaipeda includes two time spans distinguished by pronounced differences of sea level rise intensity: 1898-1975 and 1976-2005. The 51-year time span for a detailed analysis of long-term seasonal sea level fluctuations (1955-2005) was chosen purposefully because it best reflects the changes of sea level rise intensity. The analysis of long-term seasonal sea level fluctuations revealed cyclic character. Yet the montly cycle phases not always coincide. Also it was determined that the character of maximal mean monthly sea level dynamics in cold season had changed. Generalized comparative analysis of monthly sea level dynamics and climate variations showed that the sea level dynamics was a good reflection of the climate changes in cold season (October-March), whereas in warm season (April-September), sea level fluctuations were not so well reflected in climate changes.","Baltic sea; Climate variations; Sea level rise; Seasonal water level fluctuations","climate change; climate effect; climate variation; hydrometeorology; long-term change; sea level change; water level; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea",,,,,,"Bukantis, A., (1994) The Climate of Lithuania, , Vilnius University Press, 187 pp. In Lithuanian; Bukantis, A., Kavaliauskas, P., Matekoniene, V., Misiuniene, M., (1995) The Climatology, , Vilnius, Geografijos instituto darbai, 119 pp. In Lithunian; Bukantis, A., Kazakevičius, S., Korkutis, P., Markevičiene, I., Rimkus, E., Rimkute, L., Stankunavičius, G., Žukauskiene, L., The Variability of Changes of Climatic Elements on the Lithuanian Territory (1998) Vilnius, Geografijos institutas, , 171 pp. In Lithuanian; Bukantis, A., Gulbinas, Z., Kazakevičius, S., Kilkus, K., Mikelinskiene, A., Morkunaite, R., Rimkus, E., Žaromskis, R., The influence of climatic variations on recent physicl geographical process in Lithuania (2001) Vilnius, Geografijos institutas, Vilniaus universitetas, , 280 pp. In Lithuanian; Bukantis, A., Rimkus, E., Climate variability and change in Lithuania (2005) Acta Zoologica Lituanica, 15 (2), pp. 100-104; Červinskas, E., The main peculiarities of hydrodinamical regime of Curonian Lagoon.
