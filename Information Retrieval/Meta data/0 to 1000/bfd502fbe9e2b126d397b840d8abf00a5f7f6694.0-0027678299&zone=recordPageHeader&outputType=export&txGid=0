Only monetary valuation of the impacts offers the prospect of providing comparison on a single baseline. Unfortunately, practical and methodological problems generally prevent accurate valuation. For fossil fuel electricity generation the major environmental externalities result from acid deposition, tropospheric ozone and global warming. For nuclear power the main issues are major reactor accidents and long-term waste disposal. Some broad estimates of environmental externalities (in p/kWh) are given from each, based on available scientific evidence and valuation studies. The uncertainties and methodological problems associated with valuation prevent any reliable statement about the relative magnitudes of externalities resulting from fossil and nuclear generating options. In both cases, some of the impacts are incompatible with stricter interpretations of sustainability. The important environmental impacts of most renewable electricity generating options concern human amenity. With some exceptions, where areas of more than local significance for ecology or recreation are concerned, the monetary values of the impacts will be small. For most electricity conservation technologies, the externalities are negligible. Energy conservation and renewable electricity supply will therefore form key components of a sustainable energy system.",,"Air pollution; Electric rates; Environmental impact; Fossil fuels; Nuclear energy; Nuclear reactor accidents; Renewable energy resources; Waste disposal; Best environmental technology not entailing excessive costs (BATNEEC); Electric power generation",,,,,,,"Eyre, N.; Energy Technology Support Unit, Harwell, United Kingdom",,,,,,,,01404067,,NEBSD,,"English","Nucl Energy",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027678299
