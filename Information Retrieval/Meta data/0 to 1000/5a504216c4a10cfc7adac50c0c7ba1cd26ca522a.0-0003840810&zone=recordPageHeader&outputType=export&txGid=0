Although organic materials of sufficient size for conventional 14C dating are rare, wet sieving of alluvium in the Sonoran Desert yields sufficient organics for 14C measurements by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). Detrital charcoal from two Quaternary fluvial fill terraces on the western side of the Ajo Mountains yielded 14C ages of 14,880 ± 70 yr B.P. (CAMS-12408) for the Qt 1 terrace and 2490 ± 60 yr B.P. (CAMS-12414) and 2510 ± 60 yr B.P. (CAMS-12415) for the smaller inset Qt 2 terrace. These 14C ages are consistent with what is known about rates of soil development in the region. The earlier aggradation event appears to be supported by regional and possibly global climate change at about 14,000 14C yr B.P. The more recent aggradation event does not appear to be synchronous with periods of frequent paleofloods in the southwest. The offset between 14C and 36Cl ages for the same terraces provides a general indication of the time taken for the clasts to be transported to their current positions on the terraces. © 1995 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.","14C; 36Cl; Geomorphology; Organic matter; Quaternary dating methods; Soils; Sonoran Desert",,,,,,,"Allen, B.D., Anderson, R.Y., Evidence from western north america for rapid shifts in climate during the last glacial maximum (1993) Science, 260, pp. 1920-1923; Benson, L.V., Currey, D.R., Dorn, R.I., Lajoie, K.R., Oviatt, C.G., Robinson, S.W., Smith, G.I., Stine, S., Chronology of expansion and contraction of four great basin lake systems during the past 35,000 years (1990) Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 78, pp. 241-286; Blackwelder, E., Desert plains (1931) Journal of Geology, 39, pp. 133-140; Blong, R.J., Gillespie, R., Fluvial transported charcoal gives erroneous c-14 ages for recent deposits (1978) Nature, 271, pp. 739-741; Bond, G., Broecker, W., Johnsen, S., Mc Manus, J., Labeyrie, L., Jouzel, J., Bonani, G., Correlations between climate records from north atlantic sediments and greenland ice (1993) Nature, 365, pp. 143-147; Broecker, W.S., Massive iceberg discharges as triggers for global climate change (1994) Nature, 372, pp. 421-424; Broecker, W., Bond, G., Klas, M., Clark, E., Mc Manus, J., Origin of the northern atlantic's heinrich events (1992) Climate Dynamics, 6, pp. 265-273; Bryan, K., Erosion and sedimentation in the papago country, arizona, with a sketch of the geology (1922) U.S. Geological Survey Bulletin, 730, pp. 19-90; Bull, W.B., Alluvial fans and pediments of southern arizona (1984) Landscapes of Arizona., pp. 229-252. , T.L.
