The magnitude of the climate changes will depend on future emissions and climate sensitivity. These changes will have local impacts, and a significant share of coping with these changes will fall on local governmental agencies. Public health is no exception, because local public health agencies are crucial providers of disease prevention, health care, and emergency preparedness services. Methods: This article presents the results of a survey of California's local pubic health officers conducted between August and October 2007. The survey gauged health officers' concerns about the public health impacts of climate change, programs in place that could help to mitigate these health effects, and information and resource needs for better coping with a changing climate. Results: The results of this survey show that most public health officers feel that climate change poses a serious threat to public health but that they do not feel well equipped in terms of either resources or information to cope with that threat. Nonetheless, public health agencies currently implement a number of programs that will help these agencies handle some of the challenges posed by a changing climate. Conclusions: Overall, the results suggest that local public health agencies in California are likely in a better position than they perceive to address the threats associated with climate change but that there is a larger role for them to play in climate policy.","California; Climate change; Global warming; Policy; Public health","adaptation; air pollution; article; climate change; controlled study; emergency care; fire; greenhouse effect; health care policy; health education; health program; heat injury; infection; information processing; preventive medicine; priority journal; public health; public health service; resource allocation; United States; California; Communicable Diseases; Data Collection; Environmental Pollution; Fires; Greenhouse Effect; Health Personnel; Heat Stress Disorders; Physician's Role; Public Health; Risk Factors; Risk Management",,,,,,"Balbus, J., Ebi, K., Finzer, L., Malina, C., Chadwick, A., McBride, D., (2008) Are We Ready?
