The answer depends on the balance between costs of conversion to other uses and the net benefits produced in economic growth, poverty alleviation, and protection of the environment. The first section on Imperata economics sets up the analytical framework to address this question and draws on the wider development economics literature to consider whether growth and poverty alleviation are conflicting or complementary objectives. Although evidence is limited, it suggests smallholder-based agroforestry could provide the same economic growth with greater poverty alleviation than large-scale forestry estates. There is, however, no substitute for project appraisal for specific settings. The second section on Imperata policy reviews whether policy distortions and market failures provide a sufficient rationale for direct policy intervention to promote tree planting on Imperata grasslands. Estimates of imputed values of carbon sequestration to alleviate global warming are presented for Acacia mangium and rubber agroforestry. The conclusion summarizes the policy research agenda and examines the desirability and feasibility of policy intervention to promote carbon sequestration through Imperata grassland conversion to tree-based systems.","Carbon sequestration; Economic and financial analysis; Imperata grasslands; Land and tree tenure; Policy analysis","agroforestry; agroforestry policy; carbon sequestration; developing world; environmental protection; grassland conversion; grassland management; grassland rehabilitation; Imperata control; Imperata grassland; poverty alleviation; smallholders; Asia; Acacia; Acacia mangium; Imperata",,,,,,"Anderson, J.R., Dillon, J.L., Hardaker, B., (1977) Agricultural Decision Analysis, , Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA; Arnold, J.E.M., Production of forest products in agricultural and common land systems: Economic and policy issues (1992) Managing the World's Forests: Looking for Balance between Conservation and Development, pp. 433-453. , Sharma NP (ed) Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company, Dubuque, IA, USA; Barlow, C., Oil palm as a smallholder crop (1986) Occasional Paper No. 21, 21. , Palm Oil Research Institute of Malaysia (PORIM), Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Baumöl, V.V.J., Dates, W.E., (1988) The Theory of Environmental Policy, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK; Bell, C., Hazell, P., Slade, R., (1982) Project Evaluation in Regional Perspective: A Study of An Irrigation Project in Northwestern Malaysia, , Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, MD, USA; Brookfield, H., Potter, L., Byron, Y., (1995) In Place of the Forest: Environmental and Socio-economic Transformation in Borneo and the Eastern Malay Peninsula., , United Nations University Press, Tokyo, Japan; Bruijnzeel, L.A., (1990) Hydrology of Moist Tropical Forests and Effects of Conversion: A Stale of Knowledge Review, , Faculty of Earth Sciences, Free University, Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Burbridge, P., Dixon, J.A., Soewardi, B., Forestry and agriculture: Options for resource allocation in choosing lands for transmigration development (1981) Applied Geography, 1, pp. 237-258; De Foresta, H., Michon, G., The agroforest alternative to Imperata grasslands: When smallholder agriculture and forestry reach sustainability (1997) Agroforestry Systems, 36 (THIS ISSUE), pp. 105-120; Jong, W., Spontaneous intensification of swidden agriculture (1994) APANews, 9, pp. 10-11. , Asia Pacific Agroforestry Network, Bogor, Indonesia; Doolette, J.B., Smyle, J.W., Soil and water conservation technologies: Review of literature (1990) Watershed Development in Asia: Strate-gies and Technologies, pp. 35-69. , Doolette JB and Magrath WB (eds) World Bank Technical Paper No. 127.
