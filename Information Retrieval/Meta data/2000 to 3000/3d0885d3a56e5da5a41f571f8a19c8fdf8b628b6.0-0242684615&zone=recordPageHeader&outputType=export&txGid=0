Such models rely on simple, bulk biogeochemical parameterisations, whereas recent ocean observations indicate that floristic shifts may be induced by climate variability, are widespread, complex, and directly impact biogeochemical cycles. We present a strategy to incorporate ecosystem function in COAM's and to evaluate the results in relation to region-specific ecosystem dynamics and interannual variability using a template of oceanic biogeographical provinces. Illustrative simulations for nitrogen fixers with an off- line multi-species, functional group model suggest significant changes by the end of this century in ecosystem structure, with some of the largest regional impacts caused by shifts in the areal extent of biomes.",,"Anthropometry; Biodiversity; Climate change; Computer simulation; Ecosystems; Nitrogen fixation; Thermal stratification; Biogeochemicals; Geophysics; atmosphere-ocean coupling; climate change; ecosystem response; marine ecosystem; pelagic ecosystem",,,,,,"Arrigo, K.R., Phytoplankton community structure and the drawdown of nutrients and CO2 in the Southern Ocean (1999) Science, 283, pp. 365-365; Behrenfeld, M.J., Kolber, Z.S., Widespread iron limitation of phytoplankton in the South Pacific Ocean (1999) Science, 283, pp. 840-843; Behrenfeld, M.J., Biospheric primary production during an ENSO transition (2001) Science, 291, pp. 2594-2597; Blain, S., A biogeochemical study of the island mass effect in the context of the iron hypothesis: Kerguelen Islands, Southern Ocean (2001) Deep-Sea Res., 1 (48), pp. 163-187; Bopp, L., Potential impact of climate change on marine export production (2001) Global Biogeochem.
