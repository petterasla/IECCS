This article begins by taking a critical look at the scientific underpinnings of the efforts to stabilize the climate. It points to several serious question marks on the purported relationship between greenhouse gas emissions and global warming, and expresses distrust about claims of impending catastrophes related to rising sea levels, hurricanes, and spread of infectious disease. It then reviews the concurrent climate policy efforts and concludes that they are incoherent, misguided and unduly costly, and that they have so far had no perceptible impact on anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. The exceedingly ambitious policy plans currently under preparation suffer from similar fallacies. For these reasons, but also because of the remaining scientific doubts and the exorbitant costs that have to be incurred, skepticism is expressed about the preparedness to implement the climate policy plans currently on the table. © 2010 Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.","Climate policy achievements; Climate policy costs; Climate policy fallacies","anthropogenic effect; disease spread; emission inventory; environmental economics; environmental management; environmental policy; global warming; greenhouse gas; hurricane; infectious disease; policy implementation; sea level change; article; economics; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; forecasting; greenhouse effect; international cooperation; legal aspect; management; methodology; policy; statistics; theoretical model; uncertainty; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; greenhouse effect; legislation and jurisprudence; prevention and control; procedures; statistics and numerical data; trends; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Forecasting; Global Warming; International Cooperation; Models, Theoretical; Policy Making; Public Policy; Uncertainty; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Forecasting; Global Warming; International Cooperation; Models, Theoretical; Policy Making; Public Policy; Uncertainty",,,,,,"Böhringer, C., Climate politics from Kyoto to Bonn: From little to nothing?
