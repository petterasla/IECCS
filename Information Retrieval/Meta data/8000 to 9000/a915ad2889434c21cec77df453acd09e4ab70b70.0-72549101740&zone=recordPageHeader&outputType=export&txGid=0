Source-separated plastic waste was received at a material recovery facility (MRF) and processed for granulation and subsequent downstream use. In the three alternatives, plastic was assumed to be substituting virgin plastic in new products, wood in low-strength products (outdoor furniture, fences, etc.), and coal or fuel oil in the case of energy utilization. GHG accounting was organized in terms of indirect upstream emissions (e.g. provision of energy, fuels, and materials), direct emissions at the MRF (e.g. fuel combustion), and indirect downstream emissions (e.g. avoided emissions from production of virgin plastic, wood, or coal/oil). Combined, upstream and direct emissions were estimated to be roughly between 5 and 600 kg CO2-eq. tonne-1 of plastic waste depending on treatment at the MRF and CO2 emissions from electricity production. Potential downstream savings arising from substitution of virgin plastic, wood, and energy fuels were estimated to be around 60- 1600 kg CO2-eq. tonne -1 of plastic waste depending on substitution ratios and CO 2 emissions from electricity production. Based on the reviewed data, it was concluded that substitution of virgin plastic should be preferred. If this is not viable due to a mixture of different plastic types and/or contamination, the plastic should be used for energy utilization. Recycling of plastic waste for substitution of other materials such as wood provided no savings with respect to global warming.","CO2 accounting; Energy utilization; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Plastic recycling; Waste management","Avoided emissions; CO2 accounting; Direct emissions; Electricity production; Fuel combustion; Industrial processs; Material recovery facilities; New product; Plastic recycling; Plastic wastes; Coal combustion; Energy conversion; Energy utilization; Fuel oils; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Hidden Markov models; Industrial emissions; Leakage (fluid); Metal recovery; Plastic products; Recycling; Salvaging; Structural frames; Waste incineration; Waste treatment; Wood; Wood fuels; Carbon monoxide; coal; fuel; plastic; emission control; estimation method; global warming; greenhouse gas; plastic waste; recycling; waste management; air pollution; downstream processing; electricity; energy resource; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; industrial production; industrial waste; priority journal; recycling; review; solid waste management; wood; Air Pollutants; Carbon Dioxide; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Global Warming; Plastics; Refuse Disposal; Carbon Monoxide; Coal; Combustion; Effluent Treatment; Fuels; Greenhouse Gases; Plastics; Recycling; Waste Management; Wood",,"Air Pollutants; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Plastics",,,,"Astrup, T., Møller, J., Fruergaard, T., (2009) Incineration and co-combustion of waste: Accounting of greenhouse gases and global warming contributions Waste Management & Research, 27, pp. 789-799; Boustead, I., High Density Polyethylene (HDPE).
