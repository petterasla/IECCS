Although methanogenesis is a well established process and methane -the end-product of methanogenesis is a useful energy source; it is a low value end product with relatively less energy content (about 56 kJ energy per g CH4). Besides, methane and its combustion by-product are powerful greenhouse gases, and responsible for global climate change.","Bio-hydrogen gas; Dark fermentations; Escherichia coli; Molasses","Escherichia coli",,,,,,,"Ganeshkumar, A.; Bannari Amman Institute of Technology, Sathy, Erode-638401, India; email: ganeshkumar15289@gmail.com",,,,,,,,09736263,,,,"English","Res.
