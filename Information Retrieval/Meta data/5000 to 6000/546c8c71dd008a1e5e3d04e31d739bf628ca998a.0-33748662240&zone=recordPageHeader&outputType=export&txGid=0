These glacial sequences represent some of the most southerly in Europe and are important archives of regional and global climate change. The Pindus glaciers were relatively small by world standards and would have been highly responsive to changes in air temperature and precipitation. On Mount Tymphi, at least three phases of glacier advance are recorded within deposits assigned to the Skamnellian Stage (MIS 12). Further north on Mount Smolikas, a thick multiple diamicton sequence records evidence for multiple glacier advances during both the Skamnellian Stage and the Vlasian Stage (MIS 6). These records highlight the dynamic nature of glacier behaviour in the Mediterranean mountains during the Middle Pleistocene and provide new evidence for unstable cold stage climates.",,"climate change; diamicton; glacier advance; glaciology; global climate; Pleistocene; sediment analysis; Eurasia; Europe; Greece; Pindus Mountains; Southern Europe",,,,,,"Allen, J.R.M., Brandt, U., Brauer, A., Rapid environmental changes in southern Europe during the last glacial period (1999) Nature, 400, pp. 740-743; Alley, R.B., Deforming bed origin for southern Laurentide ice sheets?
