In this study, we investigate if Copper butterflies originating from different altitudes and/or being exposed to different rearing and induction temperatures show differences in HSP70 expression. HSP70 expression increased substantially at the higher rearing temperature in low-altitude butterflies, which might represent an adaptation to occasionally occurring heat spells. On the other hand, high-altitude butterflies showed much less plasticity in response to rearing temperatures, and overall seem to rely more on genetically fixed thermal stress resistance. Whether the latter indicates a higher vulnerability of high-altitude populations to global warming needs further investigation. HSP70 expression increased with both colder and warmer induction temperatures. © 2008 The Authors.","Acclimation; Clinal variation; Developmental plasticity; ELISA; Global warming; Stress resistance; Thermal adaptation; Thermal stress","heat shock protein 70; altitude; butterfly; cline; environmental stress; gene expression; heat shock; immunoassay; protein; rearing; temperature effect; altitude; animal; article; butterfly; female; gene expression regulation; male; metabolism; physiology; temperature; Altitude; Animals; Butterflies; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins; Male; Temperature; Lycaena tityrus; Papilionoidea",,"HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins",,,,"Anderson, A.R., Collinge, J.E., Hoffmann, A.A., Kellett, M., McKechnie, S.W., Thermal tolerance trade-offs associated with the right arm of chromosome 3 and marked by the hsr-omega gene in Drosophila melanogaster (2003) Heredity, 90, pp. 195-202; Angilletta Jr., M.J., Niewiarowski, P.H., Navas, C.A., The evolution of thermal physiology in ectotherms (2002) J.
