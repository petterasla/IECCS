Lambert et al. comment on Dommenget's article in their article several times, arguing that the sensitivity experiment in Dommenget, in which the SST response to surface land temperature changes are discussed, is inconsistent with their and other previously published studies. In this comment, the results of Dommenget's sensitivity experiments are discussed in more detail and the experiments are extended for longer response times. It is shown that the discussion of how the oceans' response to land forcing is time-scale dependent, with a very weak response to land forcing on interannual time scales, as discussed in Dommenget, and that it has about a twice as strong of a near-equilibrium response to land forcing on time scales longer than 100 yr. The asymmetric land-sea interaction, with the ocean forcing the land much more strongly than the land forces the oceans, as discussed in Dommenget, is confirmed by this study. © 2012 American Meteorological Society.","Climate change; Climate models; Climate variability; Decadal variability; General circulation models; Interannual variability; Interdecadal variability; Oceanic variability","Climate variability; Decadal variability; General circulation model; Inter-decadal variability; Interannual variability; Oceanic variability; Atmospheric radiation; Climate change; Climate models; Experiments",,,,,,"Alexander, M.A., Scott, J.D., Deser, C., Processes that influence sea surface temperature and ocean mixed layer depth variability in a coupled model (2000) J.
