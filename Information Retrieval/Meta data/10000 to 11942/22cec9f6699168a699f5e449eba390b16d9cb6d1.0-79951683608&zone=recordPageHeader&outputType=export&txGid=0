Antimicrobial feed-additive use is widespread within this industry and is expected to play an integral role within future carbon-management strategies due to its ability to increase feed efficiency and control disease. Materials and methods: The LCA model system boundaries for this study were: (1) antimicrobial manufacturing; (2) feed manufacturing; (3) transport of antimicrobials to the feed-mill and completed feed to the swine-production facility; (4) electricity and propane use associated with swine-production operations; and (5) swine enteric and manure-storage and handling emissions. The functional unit is the growth life cycle of one head of swine from starter (7 kg) to finisher (111 kg market weight; ""wean-to-finish"") production stages. Environmental impacts considered include global warming, acidification and eutrophication, ecotoxicity, and fossil-fuel use following EcoIndicator 99 assessment methodology. Results and discussion: High-estimated energy requirements associated with CTC and tylosin manufacturing, coupled with the large transportation distances to the feed manufacturing and swine-production facilities increased climate change and ecotoxicity impacts compared with a no antimicrobial-use scenario. However, feeding CTC resulted in several local positive changes including increased feed utilization, lower producer costs due to shortened production times, and reduced manure greenhouse gas emissions. These positive changes in the local environment however did not offset negative global impacts associated with material manufacturing and transport for the specific scenarios analyzed. Increased use of renewable-energy sources for both swine and antimicrobial production resulted in net environmental enhancement. Conclusions: This study demonstrates both the beneficial and negative environmental aspects associated with sub-therapeutic antimicrobial within the swine-production industry, and provides swine producers and environmental practitioners with tangible alternatives for meeting both livestock-health management and future carbon-management constraints within a reduced-carbon-emission consumer and regulatory marketplace. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Antimicrobial use; Chlortetracycline; Climate change; Ecotoxicity; Swine production; Tylosin","chlortetracycline; fossil fuel; propane; tylosin; acidification; animal food; article; bioenergy; climate change; controlled study; drug manufacture; ecotoxicity; energy resource; environmental impact; environmental impact assessment; eutrophication; food industry; greenhouse effect; life cycle assessment; manure; pig farming; priority journal; renewable energy; United States; waste management; Suidae",,"chlortetracycline, 12691-62-2, 57-62-5, 64-72-2, 78794-02-2; propane, 74-98-6; tylosin, 1401-69-0",,,,"Agerso, Y., Wulff, G., Vaclavik, E., Halling-Sorensen, B., Jensen, L.B., Effect of tetracycline residues in pig manure slurry on tetracycline-resistant bacteria and resistance gene tet(M) in soil microcosms (2006) Environment International, 32 (7), pp. 876-882. , DOI 10.1016/j.envint.2006.05.008, PII S0160412006000730; Allaire, S.E., Del Castillo, J., Juneau, V., Sorption kinetics of chlortetracyline and tylosin on sandy loam and heavy clay soils (2006) Journal of Environmental Quality, 35 (4), pp. 969-972. , DOI 10.2134/jeq2005.0355; Biffi, G., Boretti, A., Di Marco, A., Pennela, P., Metabolic behavior and chlortetracycline production by Streptomyces aureofaciens in liquid culture (1954) Appl Environ Microbiol, 2 (5), pp. 288-293. , 1:CAS:528:DyaG2MXhslGi; Caltrider, P.G., Hayes, H.B., Process for tylosin production (1969) US Patent, 3 (433), p. 711; Clay, S.A., Liu, Z., Thaler, R., Kennouche, H., Tylosin sorption to silty clay loam soils, swine manure, and sand (2005) Journal of Environmental Science and Health - Part B Pesticides, Food Contaminants, and Agricultural Wastes, 40 (6), pp. 841-850. , DOI 10.1080/03601230500227533; Cromwell, G.L., Why and how antibiotics are used in swine production (2002) Animal Biotechnology, 13 (1), pp. X7-27. , DOI 10.1081/ABIO-120005767; Dalgaard, R., Halberg, N., Kristensen, I.S., Larsen, I., Modelling representative and coherent Danish farm types based on farm accountancy data for use in environmental assessments (2006) Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, 117 (4), pp. 223-237. , DOI 10.1016/j.agee.2006.04.002, PII S0167880906001423; Dalgaard, R., Halberg, N., Hermansen, J.E., (2007) Danish Pork Production: An Environmental Assessment, , DJF Animal Science No. 82.
