Flies of both species were trapped at seven farms situated at four altitudes (100-1600 m a.s.l.) over a 90-week period. For both species, there were no relationships between the maximum or mean fly abundance and altitude. Only minimum abundance in winter was significantly higher at lower altitudes. Maximum and mean abundances differed significantly between nearby farms under similar climatic conditions. Seasonal fluctuations in fly abundance changed along the gradient. At lower altitudes, population growth started earlier after the winter but abundance declined earlier in summer, which resulted in a shift of the season of infestation. Seasonal fluctuations of both species were strongly related to climate variables at high altitude, mainly temperature. However, climate variables explained a decreasing proportion of the variations in abundance at lower altitudes. Stomoxys calcitrans was the most abundant species overall, but the proportion of S. n. niger increased significantly at lower altitudes and this species became predominant at 100 m a.s.l. It is concluded that stable fly infestations are unlikely to worsen in response to global warming. Maximum abundance is limited by local factors, possibly larval resources, which suggests that adequate husbandry practices could override the impact of climate change. Because S. n. niger tends to be the predominant pest at elevated temperatures, it is recommended that this species should not be introduced in areas where climate is changing. © 2008 The Authors.","Cattle pests; Global warming; Husbandry practices; Population dynamics; Stomoxys spp.","abundance; adult; altitudinal zonation; animal husbandry; climate change; climate conditions; climate effect; climate variation; fly; global warming; population dynamics; population growth; temperature effect; altitude; animal; animal husbandry; article; cattle; female; greenhouse effect; growth, development and aging; male; methodology; Muscidae; population density; population dynamics; population growth; Reunion; season; temperature; Altitude; Animal Husbandry; Animals; Cattle; Female; Greenhouse Effect; Male; Muscidae; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Population Growth; Reunion; Seasons; Temperature; Indian Ocean; Indian Ocean islands; Mascarene Islands; Reunion; Bos; Diptera; Muscidae; Stomoxys; Stomoxys calcitrans; Stomoxys niger niger",,,,,,"Bale, J.S., Masters, G.J., Hodkinson, I.D., Al, E., Herbivory in global climate change research: Direct effects of rising temperatures on insect herbivores (2002) Global Change Biology, 8, pp. 1-16; Berry, I.L., Kunz, S.E., Mortality of adult stable flies (1977) Environmental Entomology, 6, pp. 569-574; Berry, I.L., Nelson, A.K., Broce, A.B., Effects of weather on capture of stable flies (Diptera: Muscidae) by alsynite fibreglass traps (1986) Environmental Entomology, 15, pp. 706-709; Black, W.C., Krasfur, E.S., Use of sticky traps to investigate seasonal trends in the spatial distribution of house flies and stable flies (Diptera: Muscidae) (1985) Journal of Medical Entomology, 22, pp. 550-557; Campbell, J.B., Skoda, S.R., Berkebile, D.R., Boxler, D.J., Thomas, G.D., Adams, D.C., Davis, R., Effects of stable flies (Diptera: Muscidae) on weight gains of grazing yearling cattle (2001) Journal of Economic Entomology, 94, pp. 780-783; Cruickshank, I., Wall, R., Population dynamics of the sheep blowfly Lucilia sericata: Seasonal patterns and implications for control (2002) Journal of Applied Ecology, 39, pp. 493-501; Davis, A.J., Lawton, J.H., Shorrocks, B., Jenkinson, L.S., Individualistic species responses invalidate simple physiological models of community dynamics under global environmental change (1998) Journal of Animal Ecology, 67, pp. 600-612; Fielding, C.A., Whittaker, J.B., Butterfield, J.E.L., Coulson, J.C., Predicting responses to climate change: The effect of altitude and latitude on the phenology of the spittlebug Neophilaenus lineatus (1999) Functional Ecology, 13 (1), pp. 65-73; Foil, L.D., Hogsette, J.A., Biology and control of tabanids, stable flies and horn flies (1994) Revue Scientifique et Technique de l'Office International des Epizooties, 13, pp. 1125-1158; Gilles, J., David, J.-F., Duvallet, G., Effects of temperature on the rate of increase of Stomoxys calcitrans and Stomoxys niger niger (Diptera: Muscidae) from la Réunion Island (2005) Journal of Medical Entomology, 42, pp. 959-965; Gilles, J., David, J.-F., Duvallet, G., Temperature effects on development and survival of two stable flies, Stomoxys calcitrans and Stomoxys niger niger (Diptera: Muscidae), in la Réunion Island (2005) Journal of Medical Entomology, 42, pp. 260-265; Gilles, J., David, J.-F., Duvallet, G., De La Rocque, S., Tillard, E., Efficiency of traps for Stomoxys calcitrans and Stomoxys niger niger on Reunion Island (2007) Medical and Veterinary Entomology, 21, pp. 65-69; Goulson, D., Derwent, L.C., Hanley, M.E., Dunn, D.W., Abolins, S.R., Predicting calyptrate fly populations from the weather, and probable consequences of climate change (2005) Journal of Applied Ecology, 42, pp. 795-804; Greene, G.L., Seasonal population trends of adult stable flies (1989) Miscellaneous Publications of the Entomological Society of America, 74, pp. 12-17; Harley, M.B., Seasonal abundance and diurnal variations in activity of some Stomoxys and tabanidae in Uganda (1965) Bulletin of Entomological Research, 56, pp. 319-332; Hodkinson, I.D., Species response to global environmental change or why ecophysiological models are important: A reply to Davis et al (1999) Journal of Animal Ecology, 68, pp. 1259-1262; Hodkinson, I.D., Terrestrial insects along elevation gradients: Species and community responses to altitude (2005) Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, 80, pp. 489-513; Hogsette, J.A., Ruff, J.P., Jones, C.J., Stable fly biology and control in northwest Florida (1987) Journal of Agricultural Entomology, 4, pp. 1-11; Karley, A.J., Parker, W.E., Pitchford, J.W., Douglas, A.E., The mid-season crash in aphid populations: Why and how does it occur?
