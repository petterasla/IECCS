We compared total and microbial C, N and P pools and C and N metabolism in sandy loam soils (Typic Udivitrands) under indigenous broadleaf-podocarp forest, grazed introduced pasture and 19-yr old Pinus radiata D. Don forest (planted on previous pasture) in New Zealand. Total and microbial C and N declined consistently with profile depth (except for total N in L and FH samples), and in comparable depths of mineral soil (to 20 cm) tended to be lower in the pine than in the other systems. Total P, organic P and extractable inorganic P concentrations at comparable depths were, in contrast, lowest in the indigenous forest. Microbial P concentrations did not differ significantly between the different systems. Microbial C-to-microbial N ratios differed little among soil profile depths and ecosystems. In 0-10 cm depth mineral soil, CO2-C production, metabolic quotients (qCO2 values) and net N mineralization were all highest in the pasture samples. Net nitrification was high in the pine and pasture samples, but much lower in the indigenous forest samples; nitrate-N was, however, consistently present in streamwater from all three ecosystems. Changes in total C and microbial C and N pools on an area basis to 20 cm depth mineral soil were greatest after conversion of the indigenous forest to pasture; total N contents were, however, as high in the pasture as in the forest and net N mineralization was highest in the pasture. On this area basis, changes in total C contents were small after conversion of pasture to pines, although the distribution within the soil profile did differ considerably between the pine and pasture systems.",,"soil degradation; land use; nitrogen; phosphorus; soil carbon; soil chemistry; soil emission; Pinus radiata",,,,,,"Anderson, T.-H., Joergensen, R.G., Relationship between SIR and FE estimations of microbial biomass C in deciduous forest soils at different pH (1997) Soil Biology & Biochemistry, 29, pp. 1033-1042; Badalucco, L., Gelsomino, A., Dell'Orco, S., Grego, S., Nannipieri, P., Biochemical characterization of soil organic compounds extracted by 0.5 M K2SO4 before and after chloroform fumigation (1992) Soil Biology & Biochemistry, 24, pp. 569-578; Basu, S., Behera, N., The effect of tropical forest conversion on soil microbial biomass (1993) Biology and Fertility of Soils, 16, pp. 302-304; Bauhus, J., Khanna, P.K., Carbon and nitrogen turnover in two acid forest soils of southeast Australia as affected by phosphorus addition and drying and rewetting cycles (1994) Biology and Fertility of Soils, 17, pp. 212-218; Beets, P.N., Brownlie, R.K., Puruki experimental catchment: Site, climate, forest management, and research (1987) New Zealand Journal of Forestry Science, 17, pp. 137-160; Beets, P.N., Pollock, D.S., Uptake and accumulation of nitrogen in Pinus radiata stands as related to age and thinning (1987) New Zealand Journal of Forestry Science, 17, pp. 353-371; Blakemore, L.C., Searle, P.L., Daly, B.K., Methods for Chemical Analysis of Soils (1987) New Zealand Soil Bureau Scientific Report, 80; Bouwman, A.F., Exchange of greenhouse gases between terrestrial systems and the atmosphere (1990) Soils and the Greenhouse Effect, pp. 61-192. , In: Bouwman, A.F.
