Among them allergies to airborne pollen might increase or change in pattern due to the invasion of new allergic plants or due to different behavior of plants like earlier flowering. In this study we used the longest Swiss airborne pollen data set to examine the influence of the temperature increase on the time of flowering. In the case of Basel, where pollen data for 38 years are available, it was shown that due to a temperature increase the start of flowering in the case of birch occurred about 15 days earlier. Apart from a shift of the start of the flowering there is also a trend towards higher annual birch pollen quantities and an increase of the highest daily mean pollen concentrations. Due to global warming and because symptoms may appear earlier in the year people suffering from a pollen allergy might face a new unaccustomed situation. © 2008 ISB.","Global warming; Phenology; Pollen allergy; Temperature","article; birch; computer simulation; greenhouse effect; growth, development and aging; pollen; season; statistical model; Switzerland; weather; Betula; Computer Simulation; Greenhouse Effect; Models, Statistical; Pollen; Seasons; Switzerland; Weather",,,,,,"Ahas, R., Aasa, A., Menzel, A., Fedotova, G., Schleifinger, H., Changes in European spring phenology (2002) Int J Climatol, 22, pp. 1727-1738; Bättig, M.B., Wild, M., Imboden, D.M., A climate change index: Where climate change may be most prominent in the 21st century (2007) Geophys Res Lett, 34, p. 01705. , doi:10.1029/2006GL028159; Begert, M., Schlegel, T., Kirchhofer, W., Homogeneous temperature and precipitation series of Switzerland from 1864-2000 (2005) Int J Climatol, 25, pp. 65-80; Casty, C., Wanner, H., Luterbacher, J., Esper, J., Böhm, R., Temperature and precipitation variability in the European Alps since 1500 (2005) Int J Climatolol, 25, pp. 1855-1880; Clot, B., Trends in airborne pollen: An overview of 21 years of data in Neuchâtel (Switzerland) (2004) Aerobiologia, 19, pp. 3-4; D'Amato, G., Spieksma, F.T.H., Bonini, S., (1991) Allergenic Pollen and Pollinosis in Europe, , Blackwell Scientific Publisher Oxford; Dose, V., Menzel, A., Bayesian analysis of climate change impacts in phenology (2004) Global Change Biol, 10, pp. 259-272; Emberlin, J., Detandt, M., Gehrig, R., Jaeger, S., Nolard, N., Rantio- Lehtimäki, A., Responses in the start of Betula (birch) pollen seasons to recent changes in spring temperatures across Europe (2002) Int J Biometeorol, 46, pp. 159-170; Frei, T., The effects of climate change in Switzerland 1969-1996 on airborne pollen quantities from hazel, birch and grass (1998) Grana, 37, pp. 172-179; Frei, T., A change from grass pollen induced allergy to tree pollen induced allergy: 30 years of pollen observation in Switzerland (2000) Aerobiology, 16, pp. 407-416; Goldberg, C., Buch, H., Moseholm, L., Rung Weeke, E., (1988) Grana, 27, pp. 209-217; Häkkinen, R., Statistical evaluation of bud development theories: Application to bud burst of Betula pendula leaves (1999) Tree Physiol, 19, pp. 613-618; Häkkinen, R., Linkosalo, T., Hari, P., Effects of dormancy and environmental factors on timing of bud burst in Betula pendula (1998) Tree Physiol, 18, pp. 707-712; Hänninen, H., Effects of climatic change on trees from cool and temperate regions: An ecophysiological approach to modelling of budburst phenology (1995) Can J Bot, 73, pp. 183-199; Hirst, J.M., An automatic volumetric spore trap (1952) Ann Appl Biol, 39, pp. 257-265; Houghton, J.T., Climate change 2001: The scientific basis (2001) Third Assessement Report of the Working Group I, , IPCC Houghton JT et al (ed) Cambridge University Press Cambridge; Alley, R., Climate change 2007: The physical science basis (2007) Fourth Assessement Report of Working Group I, , IPCC Alley R et al (ed) Cambridge University Press Cambridge; Menzel, A., Fabian, P., Growing season extended in Europe (1999) Nature, 397, p. 659; Rasmussen, A., The effects of climate change on the birch pollen season in Denmark (2002) Aerobiologia, 18, pp. 253-265; Sneyers, R., (1990) On the Statistical Analysis of Series of Observations, , WMO, Technical Note 143, Geneva; Spieksma, F.T.H., Emberlin, J., Hjelmroos, M., Jäger, S., Leuschner, R.M., Atmospheric birch (Betula) pollen in Europe: Trends and fluctuations in annual quantities and the starting dates of the seasons (1995) Grana, 34, pp. 51-57; Fthm, S., Corden, J.M., Detandt, M., Millington, W.M., Nikkels, H., Nolard, N., Schoenmakers, C.H.H., Emberlin, J., Quantitative trends in annual totals of five common airborne pollen types (Betula, Quercus, Poaceae, Urtica and Artemisia), at five pollen-monitoring stations in western Europe (2003) Aerobiologia, 19, pp. 171-184; Wüthrich, B., Epidemiology of the allergic diseases: Are they really in the increase?
