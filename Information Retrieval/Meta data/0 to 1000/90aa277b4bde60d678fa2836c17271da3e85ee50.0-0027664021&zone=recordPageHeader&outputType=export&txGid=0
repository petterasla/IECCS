Because these gases cause important problems to the global environment, their generation from landfill sites containing solid wastes has drawn attention and their environmental impact is causing concern. Generally, the gases associated with a greenhouse effect include carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. However, there are no general basic data available concerning gases generated from biodegradation of solid wastes in landfill sites. Specifically, no assessment has been made concerning greenhouse effect gases from different landfill types. This paper proposes a quantitative model for estimating the gasification rate by different landfill types. The model is based on measurement data for a long-term material balance for an aerobic landfill and an anaerobic landfill, obtained with two types of large-scale lysimeters. This paper will also give an estimate for the amount of greenhouse effect gases by for different types of landfill and propose countermeasures for their reduction. © 1993.",,"Biodegradation; Carbon dioxide; Gases; Industrial wastes; Land fill; Methane; Global warming; Solid wastes; Greenhouse effect; biodegradation; greenhouse gas; landfill site; waste disposal",,,,,,"Fukuyama, Yearly change in amount of gases from landfill site (1988) Proc. 39th Conf.
