Global and regional driving forces are taken from an integrated model for the assessment of climate change (IMAGE 2.0) and from the results of Global Climate Model experiments. Regional hydrologic models of the largest Nile tributaries are used to calculate the impacts on Main Nile discharge. River-basin driving forces are considered through a set of future water-resource management strategies in Egypt. The combined effects of all three driving forces on future water availability in Egypt range from a large water surplus to a large water deficit by the year 2050. This range of results arises from uncertainties in the integrated modelling approach used and from the different ways Egypt may approach population growth, agricultural policy and human aspirations for greater water use in the future.",,"climate change; land use change; water resources management; water supply; Egypt, Nile Basin",,,,,,"Houghton, J.T., Callander, B.A., Varney, S.K., Climate Change 1992 (1992) The Supplementary Report to the TPCC Scientific Assessment, , Cambridge University Press; Turner, B.L., Moss, R.H., Skole, D.L., Relating land use and global land cover change: A proposal for an IGBP-HDP Core Project (1993) IGBP Report, 24. , Stockholm, Sweden; Alcamo, J., Kreileman, G.J.J., Krol, M.S., Zuidema, G., Modelling the global society-biosphere-climate system, Part 1: Model description and testing (1994) Water Air Soil Pollut., 76, pp. 1-35; Zuidema, G., Van Den Born, G.J., Kreileman, G.J.J., Alcamo, J., Simulation of global land cover changes as affected by economic factors and climate (1994) Water Air Soil Pollut., 76, pp. 163-198; De Haan, B.J., Jonas, M., Klepper, O., Krabec, J., Krol, M.S., Olendrzynski, K., An atmosphere-ocean model for integrated assessment of global change (1994) Water Air Soil Pollut., 76, pp. 283-318; Conway, D., Hulme, M., Recent fluctuations in precipitation and runoff over the Nile subbasins and their impact on Main Nile discharge (1993) Climatic Change, 25, pp. 127-151; Conway, D., (1993) The Development of a Grid-Based Hydrologic Model of the Blue Nile and the Sensitivity of Nile River Discharge to Climate Change, , Unpublished PhD Thesis, University of East Anglia, UK; Thornthwaite, C.W., Mather, J.R., Instructions and tables for computing the potential evapotranspiration and the water balance (1957) Publications in Climatology, 10, 311p. , Laboratory of Climatology, Derail Institute of Technology, Centerton, NJ; Vorosmurty, C.J., Moore, B., Grace, A.L., Gildea, M.P., Melillo, J.M., Peterson, B.J., Rastester, E.B., Steudler, P.A., Continental scale models of water balance and fluvial transport - An application to S.
