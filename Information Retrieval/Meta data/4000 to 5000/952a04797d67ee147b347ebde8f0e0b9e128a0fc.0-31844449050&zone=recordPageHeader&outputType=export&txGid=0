The average rates of N2O, CH4 and CO2 emission from the riparian gray alder stand were from -0.4 to 58 μg N2O-N m-2 h-1 and 0.1-265 μg CH4-C m-2 h-1, 55-61 mg CO2-C m-2 h-1, respectively. The average N2O-N emission from the microsites above the inflow pipes of horizontal subsurface flow (HSSF) CWs was 6.4-31 μg N2O-N m-2 h-1, whereas the outflow microsites emitted 2.4-8 μg N2O-N m-2 h-1. In vertical subsurface flow (VSSF) beds the same value was 35.6-44.7 μg N2O-N m-2 h-1. The average CH4 emission from the inflow and outflow microsites in the HSSF CWs differed significantly ranging from 640 to 9715 and from 30 to 770 μg CH4-C m-2 h-1, respectively. The average CO2 emission was somewhat higher in VSSF beds (140-291 mg CO2-C m-2 h-1) and at inflow microsites of HSSF beds (61-140 mg CO2-C m-2 h-1). The global warming potential (GWP) from N2O and CH4 was comparatively high in both types of CWs (4.8 ± 9.8 and 6.8 ± 16.2 t CO2 eq ha-1 a-1 in the HSSF CW 6.5 ± 13.0 and 5.3 ± 24.7 t CO2 eq ha-1 a-1 in the hybrid CW, respectively). The GWP of riparian alder forest from both N2O and CH4 was relatively low (0.4 ± 1.0 and 0.1 ± 0.30 t CO2 eq ha-1 a-1, respectively), whereas the CO2-C flux was remarkable (3.5 ± 3.7 t ha-1 a-1). The global influence of CWs is not significant. Even if all the global domestic wastewater were treated by wetlands, their share in the trace gas emission budget would be less than 1%. © IWA Publishing 2005.","Carbon dioxide; Constructed wetland; Global warning potential; Methane; Nitrous oxide","Carbon dioxide; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Wetlands; Constructed wetlands; Global warming potential; Greenhouse gases; Wastewater treatment; buffer; carbon; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; Carbon dioxide; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Wastewater treatment; Wetlands; constructed wetland; wastewater; alder; article; constructed wetland; controlled study; domestic waste; economic evaluation; Estonia; forest; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; riparian ecosystem; tube; waste water; waste water management; water flow; Biodegradation, Environmental; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Estonia; Greenhouse Effect; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Water Movements; Alnus incana; Betulaceae",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; carbon, 7440-44-0; methane, 74-82-8; nitrous oxide, 10024-97-2; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Methane, 74-82-8; Nitrous Oxide, 10024-97-2",,,,"(1989) Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Waste Water, , APHA 17th edn, Washington; Augustin, J., Merbach, W., Schmidt, W., Reining, E., Effect of changing temperature and water table on trace gas emission from minerotrophic mires (1996) J.
