Despite the centrality of species distributions to biodiversity conservation, the demonstrated large migration of tropical plant species in response to climate change in the past, and the expected sensitivity of species distributions to modern climate change, no study has tested for modern species migrations in tropical plants. Here we conduct a first test of the hypothesis that increasing temperatures are causing tropical trees to migrate to cooler areas. Location Tropical Andes biodiversity hotspot, south-eastern Peru, South America. Methods We use data from repeated (2003/04-2007/08) censuses of 14 1-ha forest inventory plots spanning an elevational gradient from 950 to 3400m in Manu National Park in south-eastern Peru, to characterize changes in the elevational distributions of 38 Andean tree genera. We also analyse changes in the genus-level composition of the inventory plots through time. Results We show that most tropical Andean tree genera shifted their mean distributions upslope over the study period and that the mean rate of migration is approximately 2.5-3.5 vertical metres upslope per year. Consistent with upward migrations we also find increasing abundances of tree genera previously distributed at lower elevations in the majority of study plots. Main conclusions These findings are in accord with the a priori hypothesis of upward shifts in species ranges due to elevated temperatures, and are potentially the first documented evidence of present-day climate-driven migrations in a tropical plant community. The observed mean rate of change is less than predicted from the temperature increases for the region, possibly due to the influence of changes in moisture or non-climatic factors such as substrate, species interactions, lags in tree community response and/or dispersal limitations. Whatever the cause(s), continued slower-than-expected migration of tropical Andean trees would indicate a limited ability to respond to increased temperatures, which may lead to increased extinction risks with further climate change. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Andes; Climate change; Climatic envelope; Cloud forest; Extinction; Forest plots; Global warming; Monitoring; Peru; Species migration","biodiversity; cloud forest; elevation; environmental monitoring; extinction risk; forest inventory; global warming; plant community; population distribution; population migration; slope; tropical environment; Manu National Park; Peru",,,,,,"Allen, C.D., Macalady, A.K., Chenchouni, H., Bachelet, D., McDowell, N., Vennetier, M., Kitzberger, T., Cobb, N., A global overview of drought and heat-induced tree mortality reveals emerging climate change risks for forests (2010) Forest Ecology and Management, 259, pp. 660-684; Beckage, B., Osborne, B., Gavin, D.G., Pucko, C., Siccama, T., Perkins, T., A rapid upward shift of a forest ecotone during 40years of warming in the green mountains of Vermont (2008) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, 105, pp. 4197-4202; Breshears, D.D., Huxman, T.E., Adams, H.D., Zou, C.B., Davison, J.E., Vegetation synchronously leans upslope as climate warms (2008) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, 105, pp. 11591-11592; Bunker, D.E., DeClerck, F., Bradford, J.C., Colwell, R.K., Perfecto, I., Phillips, O.L., Sankaran, M., Naeem, S., Species loss and aboveground carbon storage in a tropical forest (2005) Science, 310, pp. 1029-1031; Bush, M.B., Silman, M.R., Urrego, D.H., 48,000years of climate and forest change in a biodiversity hot spot (2004) Science, 303, pp. 827-829; Chen, I.C., Shiu, H.-J., Benedick, S., Holloway, J.D., Chey, V.K., Barlow, H.S., Hill, J.K., Thomas, C.D., Elevation increases in moth assemblages over 42years on a tropical mountain (2009) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, 106, pp. 1479-1483; Clark, J.S., Why trees migrate so fast: confronting theory with dispersal biology and the paleorecord (1998) The American Naturalist, 152, pp. 204-224; Clark, J.S., Silman, M., Kern, R., Macklin, E., HilleRisLambers, J., Seed dispersal near and far: patterns across temperate and tropical forests (1999) Ecology, 80, pp. 1475-1494; Colwell, R.K., Brehm, G., Cardelus, C.L., Gilman, A.C., Longino, J.T., Global warming, elevational range shifts, and lowland biotic attrition in the wet tropics (2008) Science, 322, pp. 258-261; Corlett, R.T., Seed dispersal distances and plant migration potential in tropical east Asia (2009) Biotropica, 41, pp. 592-598; Deutsch, C.A., Tewksbury, J.J., Huey, R.B., Sheldon, K.S., Ghalambor, C.K., Haak, D.C., Martin, P.R., Impacts of climate warming on terrestrial ectotherms across latitude (2008) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, 105, pp. 6668-6672; Feeley, K.J., Silman, M.R., Land-use and climate change effects on population size and extinction risk of Andean plants (2010) Global Change Biology, 16, pp. 3215-3222; Feeley, K.J., Silman, M.R., Biotic attrition from tropical forests correcting for truncated temperature niches (2010) Global Change Biology, 16, pp. 1830-1836; Feeley, K.J., Silman, M.R., Modelling the responses of Andean and Amazonian plant species to climate change: the effects of geo-referencing errors and the importance of data filtering (2010) Journal of Biogeography, 37, pp. 733-740; Feeley, K.J., Silman, M.R., The data void in modeling current and future distributions of tropical species (2011) Global Change Biology, 17, pp. 626-630; Feeley, K.J., Wright, S.J., Supardi, M.N.N., Kassim, A.R., Davies, S.J., Decelerating growth in tropical forest trees (2007) Ecology Letters, 10, pp. 461-469; Ghalambor, C.K., Huey, R.B., Martin, P.R., Tewksbury, J.J., Wang, G., Are mountain passes higher in the tropics?
