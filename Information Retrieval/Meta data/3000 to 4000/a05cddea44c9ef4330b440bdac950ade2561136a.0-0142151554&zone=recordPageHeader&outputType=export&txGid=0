Climate change studies indicate that the environment in such areas will steadily deteriorate with global warming; inland lakes will shrink and desert areas will expand. Mongolia is a landlocked country in north-central Asia that contains a unique ecological system consisting of taiga, steppe, and desert from north to south. The Selenge River basin (280 000 km2) in northern Mongolia is a semi-arid region underlain by permafrost, between latitudes 46 and 52°N, and longitudes 96 and 109°E. The issue of sustainable development of the basin is very important owing to its limited natural resources, including fresh water, forest, and rangeland. To examine the water cycle processes in the basin, a hydrological analysis was carried out using a simple scheme for the interaction between the land surface and atmosphere (big-leaf model) coupled to a hydrological model for the period 1988-92 to estimate the hydrological regime of the basin. Annual precipitation in this period averaged 298 mm, ranging from 212 to 352 mm at a 1° × 1° resolution based on data from 10 gauges, and the estimated annual evapotranspiration averaged 241 mm, ranging between 153 and 300 mm. This indicates that evapotranspiration accounts for the overwhelming majority of the annual precipitation, averaging 81% and ranging between 64 and 96%. The annual potential evapotranspiration in the basin averaged 2009 mm; the ratio of evapotranspiration (actual to potential evapotranspiration) was 0·12 and the wetness index (annual precipitation to potential evapotranspiration) was 0·15. © 2003 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.","Hydrological model; Selenge River basin; Semi-arid area; Water budget component","Climatology; Evapotranspiration; Forestry; Global warming; Lakes; Mathematical models; Precipitation (meteorology); River basin projects; Hydrological regime analysis; Hydrology; evapotranspiration; hydrological regime; river basin; semiarid region; water budget; Mongolia",,,,,,"Abdulla, F.A., Lettenmaier, D.P., Application of regional parameter estimation schemes to simulate the water balance of a large continental river (1997) Journal of Hydrology, 197 (1-4), pp. 258-285; Adyabadam, G., Socio-economic value of water resources (1999) Papers in Meteorology and Hydrology, 21 (2), pp. 116-121. , Davaa G.
