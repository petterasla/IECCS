The reduction of the net CO2 emission by CO2 removal and storage is the largest for the coal fired plant of others, but the decrease in the energy efficiency is also the largest. This result suggests that if there is not any problems for supplying coal, CO2 removal and storage should be equipped on the coal fired plants to mitigate the global warming. © 1995.",,"Air pollution control; Energy efficiency; Global warming; Removal; Storage (materials); Systems analysis; Thermoelectric power plants; Waste disposal; Coal fired plants; Deep sea storage; Japan; Carbon dioxide",,,,,,"The Institute of Applied Energy (1990) Report No.IAE-C-8922; Kagajo, (1994) Proc. 10th Energy System-Economic Conference, p. 383. , Tokyo; NEDO/IAE, (1992) Report No. NEDO-P-9109; NEDO/IAE, (1993) Report No. NEDO-P-9209","Matsumoto, S.; Research Institute of Innovative Technology for the Earth 9-2, Kizugawadai, Kizu, Souraku, Kyoto, 619-02, Japan",,,,,,,,01968904,,ECMAD,,"English","Energy Convers.
