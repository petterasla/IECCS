All microalgae species produce lipid however some species can contain up to 70% of their dry weight. Microalgae appear to be the only source of renewable biodiesel that is capable of meeting the global demand for transport fuels. Biodiesel production by using oilgae is an alternative process in contrast to other procedures not only being degradable and non-toxic but also as a solution to global warming via reducing emission gases. Algae-based technologies could provide a key tool for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants and other carbon intensive industrial processes. Because algae are rich in oil and can grow in a wide range of conditions, many companies are betting that it can create fuels or other chemicals cheaper than existing feedstocks. The aim of microalgae biofixation of CO2 is to operate large-scale systems that are able to convert a significant fraction of the CO2 outputs from a power plant into biofuels. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Biodiesel; Biofixation; Environmental impacts; Global warming; Microalgae; Oilgae","Alternative process; Biodiesel production; Biofixation; Coal-fired power plant; Dry weight; Global demand; Industrial processs; Micro-algae; Oilgae; Pollution problems; Transport fuel; Biodiesel; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Environmental impact; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Microorganisms; Algae; biofuel; carbon dioxide; carbon fixation; cleaner production; demand-side management; emission control; environmental impact; global warming; greenhouse gas; lipid; microalga; power plant; renewable resource; algae",,,,,,"Demirbas, A., Political, economic and environmental impacts of biofuels: A review (2009) Appl Energy, 86, pp. S108-S117; Sahin, Y., Environmental impacts of biofuels (2011) Energy Educ Sci Technol Part A, 26, pp. 129-142; Demirbas, A., Progress and recent trends in biodiesel fuels (2009) Energy Convers Manage, 50, pp. 14-34; Tian, Y., Zhao, L., Meng, H., Sun, L., Yan, J., Estimation of un-used land potential for biofuels development in (the) People's Republic of China (2010) Appl Energ, 86, pp. S77-S85; Demirbas, A., Competitive liquid biofuels from biomass (2010) Appl Energ, 88, pp. 17-28; Williamson, A.-M., Badr, O., Assessing the viability of using rape methyl ester (RME) as an alternative to mineral diesel fuel for powering road vehicles in the UK (2010) Appl Energy, 59, pp. 187-214; Demirbas, M.F., Biorefineries for biofuel upgrading: A critical review (2009) Appl Energ, 86, pp. S151-S161; Balat, M., Balat, H., Progress in biodiesel processing (2010) Appl Energ, 87, pp. 1815-1835; Kita, K., Okada, S., Sekino, H., Imou, K., Yokoyama, S., Amano, T., Thermal pre-treatment of wet microalgae harvest for efficient hydrocarbon recovery (2010) Appl Energ, 87, pp. 2420-2423; Demirbas, A.H., Inexpensive oil and fats feedstocks for production of biodiesel (2009) Energy Educ Sci Technol Part A, 23, pp. 1-13; Ozkurt, I., Qualifying of safflower and algae for energy (2009) Energy Educ Sci Technol Part A, 23, pp. 145-151; Demirbas, M.F., Microalgae as a feedstock for biodiesel (2010) Energy Educ Sci Technol Part A, 25, pp. 31-43; Demirbas, A., Production of biodiesel from algae oils (2009) Energy Sources Part A, 31, pp. 163-168; Balat, H., Social, political and economic impacts of biodiesel (2009) Soc Polit Econ Cult Res, 1, pp. 89-125; Dennis, Y., Leung, C., Wu, X., Leung, M.K.H., A review on biodiesel production using catalyzed transesterification (2010) Appl Energy, 87, pp. 1083-1095; Qi, D.H., Chen, H., Geng, L.M., Bian, Y.Z.H., Ren, X.C.H., Performance and combustion characteristics of biodiesel-diesel-methanol blend fuelled engine (2010) Appl Energy, 87, pp. 1679-1686; Gao, C., Zhai, Y., Ding, Y., Wu, Q., Application of sweet sorghum for biodiesel production by heterotrophic microalga Chlorella protothecoides (2010) Appl Energy, 87, pp. 756-761; Leduc, S., Natarajan, K., Dotzauer, E., McCallum, I., Obersteiner, M., Optimizing biodiesel production in India (2009) Appl Energy, 86, pp. S125-S131; Yee, K.F., Tan, K.T., Abdullah, A.Z., Lee, K.T., Life cycle assessment of palm biodiesel: revealing facts and benefits for sustainability (2009) Appl Energy, 86, pp. S189-S196; Leung, D.Y.C., Wu, X., Leung, M.K.H., A review on biodiesel production using catalyzed transesterification (2010) Appl Energy, 87, pp. 1083-1095; Balat, M., Balat, H., Progress in biodiesel processing (2010) Appl Energy, 87, pp. 306-2619; Ganapathy, T., Murugesan, K., Gakkhar, R.P., Performance optimization of Jatropha biodiesel engine model using Taguchi approach (2010) Appl Energy, 86, pp. 2476-2486; Wen, Z., Yu, X., Tu, S.-T., Yan, J., Dahlquist, E., Synthesis of biodiesel from vegetable oil with methanol catalyzed by Li-doped magnesium oxide catalysts (2010) Appl Energy, 87, pp. 743-748; Demirbas, A., Progress and recent trends in biofuels (2007) Prog Energy Combust Sci, 33, pp. 1-18; Altun, S., Fuel properties of biodiesels produced from different feedstocks (2011) Energy Educ Sci Technol Part A, 26, pp. 165-174; (2009), EBB.
