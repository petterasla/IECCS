A large number of studies of this process have been undertaken. The findings of these studies have been incorporated into a quantitative policy model projecting supplies of commodities (in terms of area and crop yields), equilibrium prices, and international trade volumes to the year 2020. These projections show that a 'global food crisis,' as would be manifested in high commodity prices, is unlikely to occur. The same projections show, however, that in many countries, 'local food crisis,' as manifested in low agricultural incomes and associated low food consumption in the presence of low food prices, will occur. Simulations show that delays in the diffusion of modern biotechnology research capabilities to developing countries will exacerbate local food crises. Similarly, global climate change will also exacerbate these crises, accentuating the importance of bringing strengthened research capabilities to developing countries.",,"agricultural worker; agriculture; Asia; biotechnology; cereal; classification; conference paper; crop; demography; developing country; economic aspect; food control; food industry; food intake; global climate; industrialization; malnutrition; model; policy; priority journal; research; rice; Agriculture; Animal Husbandry; Animals; Biotechnology; Cereals; Climate; Demography; Food Supply; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Oryza sativa; Population Growth; Research",,,,,,"(1992) World Population Prospects, , U.N., New York; Evenson, R.E., Herdt, W., Hossain, M., (1996) Rice Research in Asia: Progress and Priorities, , CAB International, Wallingford, U.K; Birkhaeuser, D., Evenson, R.E., Feder, G., (1991) Economic Development and Cultural Change, 39 (3), pp. 607-650; Evenson, R.E., Pray, C.E., Rosegrant, M.W., (1999) Agricultural Research and Productivity Growth in India, , Research Report 109 (International Food Policy Research Institute, Washington, DC); Evenson, R.E., Westphal, L., Technological Change and Technology Strategy (1994) Handbook of Development Economics, 3. , eds.
