Soot aerosols represent a major research focus as they influence climate by absorbing incoming solar radiation resulting in a highly uncertain warming effect. The uncertainty stems from the fact that the actual amount soot warms our atmosphere strongly depends on the manner and degree in which it is mixed with other species, a property referred to as mixing state. In global models and inferences from atmospheric heating measurements, soot radiative forcing estimates currently differ by a factor of 6, ranging between 0.2-1.2 W/m2, making soot second only to CO2 in terms of global warming potential. This article reports coupled in situ measurements of the size-resolved mixing state, optical properties, and aging timescales for soot particles. Fresh fractal soot particles dominate the measured absorption during peak traffic periods (6-9 AM local time). Immediately after sunrise, soot particles begin to age by developing a coating of secondary species including sulfate, ammonium, organics, nitrate, and water. Based on these direct measurements, the core-shell arrangement results in a maximum absorption enhancement of 1.6x over fresh soot. These atmospheric observations help explain the larger values for soot forcing measured by others and will be used to obtain closure in optical property measurements to reduce one of the largest remaining uncertainties in climate change.","Aerosol; Atmosphere; Climate; Composition","ammonia; carbon dioxide; nitrate; organic compound; sulfate; water; aerosol; article; atmosphere; climate change; greenhouse effect; heating; measurement; model; priority journal; radiative forcing; solar radiation; soot; sun",,"ammonia, 14798-03-9, 51847-23-5, 7664-41-7; carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; nitrate, 14797-55-8; sulfate, 14808-79-8; water, 7732-18-5",,,,"Ramanathan, V., Atmospheric brown clouds: Impacts on South Asian climate and hydrological cycle (2005) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 102, pp. 5326-5333; Twohy, C.H., Clarke, A.D., Warren, S.G., Radke, L.F., Charlson, R.J., Light-absorbing material extracted from cloud droplets and its effect on cloud albedo (1989) J Geophys Res, 94, pp. 8623-8631; Riemer, N., Vogel, H., Vogel, B., Soot aging time scales in polluted regions during day and night (2004) Atmos Chem Phys, 4, pp. 1885-1893; Ackerman, T.P., Toon, O.B., Absorption of visible radiation in atmosphere containing mixtures of absorbing and non-absorbing particles (1981) Appl Optics, 20, pp. 3661-3668; Bond, T.C., Bergstrom, R.W., Light absorption by carbonaceous particles: An investigative review (2006) Aerosol Sci Tech, 40, pp. 27-67; Chung, S.H., Seinfeld, J.H., Climate response of direct radiative forcing of anthropogenic black carbon (2005) J Geophys Res, 110, pp. D11102. , June 1, 10.1029/2004JD005441; Haywood, J.M., Roberts, D.L., Slingo, A., Edwards, J.M., Shine, K.P., General circulation model calculations of the direct radiative forcing by anthropogenic sulfate and fossil-fuel soot aerosol (1997) J Climate, 10, pp. 1562-1577; Jacobson, M.Z., Strong radiative heating due to the mixing state of black carbon in atmospheric aerosols (2001) Nature, 409, pp. 695-697; Menon, S., Hansen, J., Nazarenko, L., Luo, Y.F., Climate effects of black carbon aerosols in China and India (2002) Science, 297, pp. 2250-2253; Stier, P., Seinfeld, J.H., Kinne, S., Boucher, O., Aerosol absorption and radiative forcing (2007) Atmos Chem Phys Diss, 7, pp. 7171-7233; Jacobson, M.Z., A physically-based treatment of elemental carbon optics: Implications for global direct forcing of aerosols (2000) Geophys Res Lett, 27, pp. 217-220; Ramanathan, V., Carmichael, G., Global and regional climate changes due to black carbon (2008) Nature Geosci, 1, pp. 221-227; Sato, M., Global atmospheric black carbon inferred from AERONET (2003) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 100, pp. 6319-6324; Bond, T.C., Sun, H.L., Can reducing black carbon emissions counteract global warming?
