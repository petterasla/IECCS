Analysis showed that the observed cooling was caused by anomalous cold advection at the eastern edge of the area of positive sea-level pressure and geopotential anomaly centered over Scandinavia and the Gulf of Bothnia. This November circulation pattern is related to the positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation in the preceding winter. It is concluded that the observed November cooling was caused by the prevalence of the positive phase of the wintertime Arctic Oscillation and North Atlantic Oscillation in the last two decades of the 20th century. © Allerton Press Inc. 2008.",,"Advection; Atmospheric pressure; Cooling; Sea level; Arctic oscillation; November cooling; Global warming; advection; Arctic Oscillation; cooling; geopotential; global warming; North Atlantic Oscillation; regional climate; sea level pressure; twentieth century; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; Eurasia; Europe; Gulf of Bothnia; Northern Europe; Russian Federation; Scandinavia",,,,,,"Gruza, G.V., Rankova, E.Ya., ""Climate Oscillations and Changes in Russia"" (2003) Izv.
