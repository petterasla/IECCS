Ensuring the sustainability of biomass feedstocks requires a greater understanding of all aspects of energy crop production, their ecological impacts and yields. This work compares the life-cycle environmental impact of natural gas and biomass from two energy crop systems grown under typical UK agronomic practice. As reported in previous studies the energy crops provide significant reductions in global warming potential (GWP) compared to natural gas. Compared to no fertiliser application, applying inorganic fertiliser increases the GWP by 2% and applying sewage sludge increases the GWP by a lesser extent. In terms of an equivalent GWP savings per unit area of land, the emissions associated with fertiliser production and application can be offset by a yield increase of <0.2 t/ha. However, very large increases in eutrophication and acidification levels are incurred compared to the natural gas reference case when applying either fertiliser. For sewage sludge the impact of varying the allocation factor between the function of wastewater treatment and that of crop growth is also illustrated. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Biomass; Energy crop; Fertiliser; Life-cycle assessment; Sewage; Sustainability","Agronomic practices; Application rates; Bio-energy; Biomass crop; Biomass feedstock; Crop growth; Ecological impacts; Energy crops; Fertilisers; Global warming potential; Greenhouse gas reductions; Life-cycle assessment; Life-cycle environmental impact; Per unit; Renewable energies; Sustainability; Yield increase; Biomass; Cultivation; Energy management; Environmental impact; Eutrophication; Fertilizers; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Natural gas; Sewage sludge; Sewage treatment; Sustainable development; Wastewater; Wastewater treatment; Crops; acidification; agronomy; bioenergy; biomass power; crop production; emission control; energy crop; eutrophication; fertilizer application; global warming; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; natural gas; renewable resource; sewage; sludge; sustainability; United Kingdom",,,,,,"Anderson, K., Bows, A., Mander, S., From long-term targets to cumulative emission pathways: reframing UK climate policy (2008) Energy Policy, 36 (10), pp. 3714-3722; (2008), Climate Change Act.
