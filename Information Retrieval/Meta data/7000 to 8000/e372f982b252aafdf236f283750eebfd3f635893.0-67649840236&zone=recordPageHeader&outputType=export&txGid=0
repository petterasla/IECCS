Extended cultivation resulted in a decrease in monsoon rainfall over the Indian subcontinent and southeastern China and an associated weakening of the Asian summer monsoon circulation. The precipitation decrease in India was marked and was consistent with the observational changes derived from examining the Himalayan ice cores for the concurrent period. Between the 1700s and the 1850s, the anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gases and aerosols were still minor; also, no long-term trends in natural climate variations, such as those caused by the ocean, solar activity, or volcanoes, were reported. Thus, we propose that the land cover/ use change was the major source of disturbances to the climate during that period. This report will set forward quantitative examination of the actual impacts of land cover/use changes on Asian monsoons, relative to the impact of greenhouse gases and aerosols, viewed in the context of global warming on the interannual, decadal, and centennial time scales.","Atmospheric water balance; Climate change; Historical land-cover change; Monsoon rainfall","rain; aerosol; article; Asian; atmosphere; China; circulation; climate change; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; India; precipitation; priority journal; quantitative analysis; summer; tillage",,,,,,"Ramankutty, N., Foley, J.A., Estimating historical changes in global land cover: Croplands from 1700 to 1992 (1999) Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 13 (4), pp. 997-1027. , DOI 10.1029/1999GB900046; Pielke Sr., R.A., The influence of land-use change and landscape dynamics on the climate system: Relevance to climatic-change policy beyond the radiative effect of greenhouse gases (2002) Phil Trans R Soc London Ser A, 360, pp. 1705-1719; Vegetation, water, humans and the climate: A new perspective on an interactive system (2004) Global Change - The IGBP Series, , Kabat P, et al., eds Springer, Berlin; Brovkin, V., Sitch, S., Von Bloh, W., Claussen, M., Bauer, E., Cramer, W., Role of land cover changes for atmospheric CO2 increase and climate change during the last 150 years (2004) Global Change Biology, 10 (8), pp. 1253-1266. , DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2486.2004.00812.x; Brovkin, V., Biogeophysical effects of historical land cover changes simulated by six Earth system models of intermediate complexity (2006) Clim Dyn, 26, pp. 587-600; Bounoua, L., Defries, R., Collatz, G.J., Sellers, P., Khan, H., Effects of land cover conversion on surface climate (2002) Climatic Change, 52 (1-2), pp. 29-64. , DOI 10.1023/A:1013051420309; Feddema, J., Oleson, K., Bonan, G., Mearns, L., Washington, W., Meehl, G., Nychka, D., A comparison of a GCM response to historical anthropogenic land cover change and model sensitivity to uncertainty in present-day land cover representations (2005) Climate Dynamics, 25 (6), pp. 581-609. , DOI 10.1007/s00382-005-0038-z; Chase, T.N., Pielke Sr., R.A., Kittel, T.G.F., Nemani, R.R., Running, S.W., Simulated impacts of historical land cover changes on global climate in northern winter (2000) Climate Dynamics, 16 (2-3), pp. 93-105; Zhao, M., Pitman, A.J., Chase, T., The impact of land cover change on the atmospheric circulation (2001) Climate Dynamics, 17 (5-6), pp. 467-477; Mabuchi, K., Sato, Y., Kida, H., Climatic impact of vegetation change in the Asian tropical region.
