No Austrian mortality data have yet been reported for this summer period. METHODS: Daily mortality data for Vienna between 1998 and 2004 were obtained from Statistics Austria and meteorological data from the Austrian Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics. Heatwaves were defined using the Kysely criterion. Daily mortality for May to September was predicted by a generalized additive model considering over-dispersion with Poisson deviates and a log link. Seasonal trend was accounted for by a natural spline, weekdays were modeled by dummy variables and heatwave days were included as dichotomous predictor. RESULTS: The average seasonal temperature for May to September in Vienna has increased by more than 1.7°C during the last 35 years. In 2003 there was an excess of heatwave days, 44 overall, that resulted in an increased number of deaths, approximately 180, most of which were not due to 'harvesting'. Heatwave days between 1998 and 2004 were associated with a significantly increased relative mortality risk of 1.13 [95% confidence interval 1.09-1.17]. This increase was stronger in females than in males. Although excess mortality was seen in all age groups, it reached significance only in the elderly population over 65 years. DISCUSSION: An impact of heatwaves on mortality was apparent in Vienna, although not as pronounced as in France and south-western Europe. In 2003 at least 130 heatwave-related deaths in Vienna could have been avoided by prompt medical assistance and proper advice about how to cope with excessive thermal conditions. Preventive programs are warranted during heatwaves, especially to target elderly people, because the likelihood of heatwaves as a consequence of global warming is increasing. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.","Heatwaves; Mortality","age distribution; aged; article; Austria; controlled study; environmental temperature; female; heat injury; human; male; meteorology; mortality; seasonal variation; sex difference; statistical analysis; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Austria; Child; Child, Preschool; Climate; Female; Heat Stress Disorders; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Infrared Rays; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Survival Analysis; Survival Rate",,,,,,"(2005) 11th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and 1st Conference of the Parties serving as Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, , www.ipcc.ch/press/sp-07122005.htm, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , Available at; Kovats, R.S., Bouma, M.J., Hajat, S., Worrall, E., Haines, A., El Nino and health (2003) Lancet, 362, pp. 1481-1489; (1996) Climate change and human health: An assessment prepared by a task group on behalf of the World Health Organization, the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme, 7. , McMichael AJ, Haines A, Slooff R, Kovats S eds, World Health Organization, Geneva; Basu, R., Samet, J.M., Relation between elevated ambient temperature and mortality: A review of the epidemiologic evidence (2002) Epidemiol Rev, 24, pp. 190-202; Curriero, F.C., Heiner, K.S., Samet, J.M., Zeger, S.L., Strug, L., Patz, J.A., Temperature and mortality in 11 cities of the eastern United States (2002) Am J Epidemiol, 155, pp. 80-87; Braga, A.L., Zanobetti, A., Schwartz, J., The effect of weather on respiratory and cardiovascular deaths in 12 US cities (2002) Environ Health Perspect, 110, pp. 859-863; Braga, A.L., Zanobetti, A., Schwartz, J., The time course of weather-related deaths (2001) Epidemiology, 12, pp. 662-667; Keatinge, W.R., Donaldson, G., Cordioli, E., Martinelli, M., Mackenbach, J., Nayha, S., Vuori, I., Heat related mortality in warm and cold regions of Europe: Observational study (2000) BMJ, 81, pp. 795-800; Martens, W.J., Climate change, thermal stress and mortality changes (1998) Soc Sci Med, 46, pp. 331-344; Pan, W., Li, L., Tsai, M., Temperature extremes and mortality from coronary heart disease and cerebral infarctions in elderly Chinese (1995) Lancet, 345, pp. 353-355; Climate change 2001: The scientific basis (2001) Contribution of Working Group I to the third assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), , Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (, Houghton JT, Ding Y, Griggs DJ, Noguer M, van der Linden PJ, Xiaosu D eds, Cambridge University Press, UK; Poumadere, M., Mays, C., Le Mer, S., Blong, R., The 2003 heat wave in France: Dangerous climate change here and now (2005) Risk Anal, 25, pp. 1483-1494; (2004) Impact of summer 2003 heat wave in Europe.
