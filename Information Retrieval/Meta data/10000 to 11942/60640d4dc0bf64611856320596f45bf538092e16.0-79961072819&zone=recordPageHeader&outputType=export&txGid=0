In alpine snowpatches, the timing of snowmelt is a strong environmental filter. In coming decades, the strength of this filter is likely to relax with global climate change. We used three continuous plant functional traits (leaf area, plant height, seed mass) and their divergence (using the FD var index) to document current patterns of community assembly and predict plant community responses to future environmental filters in alpine snowpatch vegetation. The community trait-weighted mean for leaf area and height, but not seed mass, was significantly higher in early snowmelt zones relative to mid and late melting zones across all snowpatches. Mean FD var for height (but not leaf area or seed mass), by contrast, was substantially lower in early snowmelt zones, indicating that species growing in early melt zones are consistently taller than those growing in other zones. These results suggest that if climate change leads to earlier snowmelt and hence, a longer growing season, taller (more competitive) species with larger leaf areas (more productive) may replace short species in snowpatches as these plant communities re-assemble in response to changing environmental filters. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Australia; Climate change; Community assembly; Declining snow cover","alpine environment; climate change; community composition; functional change; global change; leaf area; plant community; snow cover; snowmelt; Australia",,,,,,"Atkin, O.K., Collier, D.E., Relationship between soil nitrogen and floristic variation in late snow areas of the Koscuisko alpine region (1992) Aust J Bot, 40, pp. 139-149; Bannister, P., Maegli, T., Dickinson, K.J.M., Halloy, S.R.P., Knight, A., Lord, J.M., Mark, A.F., Spenser, K.L., Will loss of snow cover during climatic warming expose New Zealand alpine plants to increased frost damage?
