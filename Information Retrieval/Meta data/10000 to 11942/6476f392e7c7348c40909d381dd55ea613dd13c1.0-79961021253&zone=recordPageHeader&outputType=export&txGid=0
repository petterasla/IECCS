Northeast China is located in a high latitude region and is sensitive to climate change. Extreme minimum temperatures causing cold damage during the warm season is a major type of agro-meteorological disaster in Northeast China, which causes serious reductions in crop yield. In this paper, we analyzed the temporal and spatial trends in the frequency of extreme minimum temperatures during the warm season (from May to September) during 1956-2005 in Northeast China. Abrupt climatic changes were identified using the Mann-Kendall test. The results show that the frequency of extreme minimum temperature days during the warm season in Northeast China decreases significantly from 1956 to 2005 with a background of climate warming. The highest number of extreme minimum temperature days occurred in the 1970s and 1980s, and there was an abrupt climatic change in 1993. The spatial analysis identified that the north and southeast of the region experienced a larger decrease in the number of extreme low temperature days than the west and south of the region. Rice, sorghum, corn, and soybeans are most vulnerable to cold damage. In severe low temperature years, the average crop yield was reduced by 15. 2% in Northeast China. ©. 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Cold damage; Frequency; Impact; Northeast China; Warm season","air temperature; climate change; crop production; crop yield; environmental impact; extreme event; global warming; Northern Hemisphere; spatiotemporal analysis; China; Glycine max; Zea mays",,,,,,"Bensiton, M., Stephenson, D.B., Extreme climatic events and their evolution under changing climatic conditions (2004) Glob Planet Chang, 44, pp. 1-9; Berger, W.H., Labeyrie, L.D., Abrupt climatic change, evidence and implications (1987) Math Phys Sci, 216, pp. 173-183; Cc, I.P., (2001) The IPCC Third Assessment Report.
