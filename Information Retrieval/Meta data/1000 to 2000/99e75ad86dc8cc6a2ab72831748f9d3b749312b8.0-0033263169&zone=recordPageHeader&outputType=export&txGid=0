This prediction is revisited, using a broader model that allows the greenhouse effect to be considered. The new model predicts a global warming of ΔTE=(114K)ε, where ε is the rate of surface energy release in units of the average incident solar radiation, 342 W m-2, and ΔTE is the average temperature rise at the earth's surface. Present values of these quantities, excluding geothermal sources, are ε = 0.69×10-4 and ΔTE=7.9mK. The model assigns a small number of optical parameters to the atmosphere and surface and qualifies the simple warming prediction: It is rigorous only if parameters other than ε are unchanged. The model is not complex and should serve as an aid to an elementary understanding of global warming. © 1999 American Association of Physics Teachers.",,,,,,,,"Kittel, C., Kroemer, H., Thermal Physics, p. 111. , (Freeman, San Francisco, 1980), 2nd ed., Exercise 4.5; Hartmann, D.L., (1994) Global Physical Climatology, p. 2. , Academic, San Diego; noteSpencer, R.W., Christy, J.R., Precise monitoring of global temperature trends from satellites (1990) Science, 247, pp. 1558-1562; Christy, J.R., Spencer, R.W., Braswell, W.D., How accurate are satellite thermometers?
