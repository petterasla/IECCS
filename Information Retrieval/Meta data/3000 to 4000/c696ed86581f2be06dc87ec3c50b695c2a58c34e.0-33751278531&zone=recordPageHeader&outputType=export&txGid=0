The materials covered are high-strength steels, aluminum, magnesium, and plastic materials in structural and hang-on parts. Because of rising public concern on global warming, reduced fuel consumption of cars and lightweight design become more and more important. Cost effective light weight design leads to multimaterial design concepts, where the most suitable material for the specific application is chosen. Parallel to the trend to multimaterial design the requirements for joining technologies are increasing. Within the joining technologies there is a trend to combined processes like welding and adhesive bonding, or riveting and adhesive bonding. The potential for development of existing joining techniques and the demands on future methods are shown.",,"Adhesive bonding; Automobile manufacturing; High-strength steels; Bonding; Cost effectiveness; Fuel consumption; Global warming; Plastic products; Steel; Automotive industry",,,,,,"(1999) Fügen Zukunftsweisender Werkstoffe, p. 6. , Aachener Schweißtechnik Kolloquium.
