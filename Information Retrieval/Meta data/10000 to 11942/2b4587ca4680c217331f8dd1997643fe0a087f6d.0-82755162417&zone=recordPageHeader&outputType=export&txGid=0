Since buildings account for 25% of Korea's total energy consumption they are the key target in the reduction of carbon dioxide, the principal culprit of global warming. This paper focused on the thoughtless energy waste in universities and researched the characteristics of campus buildings, surveying the energy consumption patterns identified in accordance with the number of users and the period of use. In addition, this paper also established an optimized limitation of future energy consumption by forecasting the trend of growing consumption after examining the kinds and quantities of energy installations being utilized in campus buildings.","Energy consumption; Energy intensity; Energy saving potential; Field survey; University",,,,,,,"Bonnet, C., Devel, P., Faucher, J., Roturier, J.-F., Analysis of electricity and water end-uses in university campuses: Case-study of the University of Bordeaux in the framework of the Ecocampus European Collaboration (2002) Journal of Cleaner Production, 10, pp. 13-24; (2008) 2007 Survey data of energy consumption, , Korea Energy Management Corporation; Kim, J.-S., (1999) The characteristics of University Institution by the Campus Types in the National Universities, , Korean Institute of Educational Facilities; Seok, J.H., Yang, J.W., Jung, H.-T., A Study on the Evaluation of Energy Performance According to Greenery Cover in Education Buildings (2008) Journal of the Korean Solar Energy Society, 28 (6); Jenkins, D.P., Singh, H., Eames, P.C., Interventions for large-scale carbon emission reductions in future UK offices (2009) Energy and Buildings, 41, pp. 1374-1380; Fumo, N., Mago, L.M., Chamra, P.J., Analysis of cooling, heating, and power systems based on site energy consumption (2009) Applied Energy, 86, pp. 928-932; Alcantara, V., Roca, J., Energy and CO2 emissions in Spain (1995) Energy Economics, 17 (3), pp. 221-230; Kikuchi, E., Bristow, C.A., Kennedy, D., Evaluation of region-specific residential energy systems for GHG reductions: Case studies in Canadian cities (2009) Energy Policy, 37, pp. 1257-1266; Kihara, I., Inoue, T., CO2 emission per individual based on a survey of university students (2002) Applied Energy, 72, pp. 645-658; Gallachoir, B.P., Keane, M., Morrissey, E., Donnell, J.O., Using indicators to profile energy consumption and to inform energy policy in a university-A case study in Ireland (2007) Energy and Buildings, 39, pp. 913-922; Scheuer, C., Keoleian, P., Reppe, G.A., Life cycle energy and environmental performance of a new university building: Modeling challenges and design implications (2003) Energy and Buildings, 35, pp. 1049-1064; Yildirim, N., Toksoy, G., Gökçen, M., Distict heating system design for a university campus (2006) Energy and Buildings, 38, pp. 1111-1119; Abraham, C., George, V., Jose, S., Deshpande, M., (2008) Energy audit of IIT-Bombay Campus, , Draft Final Report, Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay; Amanti, S.T., (2006) Potential Energy Savings on the MIT Campus, , Submitted to the Department of Mechanical Engineering on May 12, 2006 in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Degree of Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering; Kim, J.Y., Kim, W.H., Hong, D.S., (2005) A study on analyzing the energy load classified by architectural factors of public buildings in Daegu, , Korea Journal of the Institute of Ecological Architecture and Environment; Lee, K.-B., (2006) A study on the improvement in the electric facilities for an extensive campus, , Graduate School of Industry, MA thesis, Chungnam National University, Korea; Murakami, S., (2006) Energy Consumption, , Efficiency, Conservation, and Greenhouse Gas Mitigation in Japan's Building Sector, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in collaboration with Japanese institutions identified above","Kim, J.-Y.; Korean Intellectual Property Office, Government Complex Daejeon Building 4, 189, Cheongsa-ro, Seo-gu, Daejeon, 302-701, South Korea; email: glory1st@naver.com",,,,,,,,13467581,,,,"English","J.
