The gaseous decomposition products were further reacted with calcium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate, and the purity of the fluorides obtained was examined. It was found that 99% or more of the SF6 gas could be decomposed at or below temperatures of 1000°C by adding hydrogen gas. Furthermore, the decomposition reaction rate of SF6 gas could be evaluated with a firstorder rate equation of SF6 gas concentration, and the apparent rate constant could be determined. In addition, the frequency factor (2.08×103 s-1) and the activation energy (8.314×104J/mol) for decomposition of SF6 gas were calculated from an Arrhenius plot of the rate constants. It was also confirmed that the decomposition products HF and H2S could be separated and fixed by a gas-solid reaction with calcium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate, and the products formed were of sufficient purity for easy re-use (CaF2: 98% or more and NaF: 99% or more).","Decomposition; Dry-fixation; Fluoride; Reconverted Resources; Sf6","Calcium compounds; Carbon dioxide; Decomposition; Fluorine compounds; Gases; Hydrogen; Sodium compounds; Decomposition products; Dry-fixation; Reconverted resources; Sulfur compounds",,,,,,"Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; The Science of Climate Change, the Second Assessment Report Climate Change 1995.
