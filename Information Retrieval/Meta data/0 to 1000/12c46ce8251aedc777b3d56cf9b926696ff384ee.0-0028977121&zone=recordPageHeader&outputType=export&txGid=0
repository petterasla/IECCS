Although ambient air is always composed of pollutant mixtures, in determining the relative air quality and its ecosystem impacts at a given geographic location and time, a predominant number of studies have shown that at the present time surface level O3 is the most important phytotoxic air pollutant. Within the North American Great Plains, the precursors for surface-level O3 are mainly anthropogenic NO(x) and VOCs (volatile organic compounds). Texas and Alberta are the top regions of such emissions in the United States and Canada, respectively. This appears to be due mainly to the prevalence of natural gas and/or oil industry in the two regions and the consequent urbanization. Nevertheless, the total emissions of NO(x) and VOCs within the North American Great Plains represent only about 25-36% of the corresponding total emissions within the contiguous United States and the whole of Canada. within the Great Plains many major crop and tree species are known to be sensitive to O3. This sensitivity assessment, however, is based mainly on our knowledge from univariate (O3 only) exposure-plant response studies. In the context of global climate change, in almost all similar univariate studies, elevated CO2 concentrations have produced increases in plant biomass (both crop and tree species). The question remains as to whether this stimulation will offset any adverse effects of elevated surface O3 concentrations. Future research must address this important issue both for the Great Plains and for all other geographic locations, taking into consideration spatial and temporal variabilities in the ambient concentrations of the two trace gases.",,"carbon dioxide; natural gas; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; ambient air; article; biomass; canada; crop; ecosystem; environmental impact assessment; forest; global climate; greenhouse effect; nonhuman; north america; oil industry; phytotoxicity; tree; united states; urbanization; air quality; nitrogen oxides; ozone; terrestrial ecosystem; volatile organic compound; Canada, Prairies; USA, (Midwest), Great Plains",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; natural gas, 8006-14-2; nitrogen dioxide, 10102-44-0; ozone, 10028-15-6",,,,,"Krupa, S.V.; Department of Plant Pathology, University of Minnesota, St Paul, MN 55108, United States",,,,,,,,02697491,,ENPOE,,"English","ENVIRON.
