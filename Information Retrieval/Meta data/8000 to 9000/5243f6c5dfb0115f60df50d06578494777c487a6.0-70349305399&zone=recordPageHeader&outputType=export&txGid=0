Here, we quantify the resource potential and investigate the environmental implications of woodbased transportation relative to a fossil reference system for a specific region in Norway. We apply a well-to-wheel life cycle assessment to evaluate four E85 production system designs based on two distinct wood-to-ethanol conversion technologies. We form best and worst case scenarios to assess the sensitivity of impact results through the adjustment of key parameters, such as biomass-to-ethanol conversion efficiency and upstream biomass transport distance. Depending on the system design, global warming emission reductions of 46% to 68% per-MJ-gasoline avoided can be realized in the region, along with reductions in most of the other environmental impact categories considered. We find that the region's surplus forest-bioenergy resources are vast; use for the production of bioethanol today would have resulted in the displacement of 55% to 68% of the region's gasoline-based global warming emission-or 6% to 8% of Norway's total global warming emissions associated with road transportation. © 2009 by Yale University.","Biochemical; Biofuels; Cellulosic ethanol; Industrial ecology; Thermochemical; Wood","Bio-energy; Bio-ethanols; Biochemical; Boreal forests; Considerable resources; Emission reduction; Environmental implications; Ethanol conversion; Industrial ecology; Key parameters; Life-cycle assessments; Production system designs; Reference systems; Regional analysis; Resource potentials; Road transportation; Scandinavia; Second generation; System design; Thermochemical; Transport distances; Transport fuel; Well-to-wheel; Worst case scenario; Bioethanol; Biomass; Cellulosic ethanol; Conversion efficiency; Efficiency; Emission control; Environmental impact; Gasoline; Global warming; Regional planning; Systems analysis; Ethanol; alternative fuel; biofuel; boreal forest; emission control; environmental impact; ethanol; forest resource; life cycle analysis; traffic emission; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Norway; Scandinavia",,,,,,"Althaus, H.-J., Chudacoff, M., Hischier, R., Jungbluth, N., Ossés, M., Primas., A., Life cycle inventories of chemicals (2007) Ecoinvent Report No. 8, , v. 2.0.
