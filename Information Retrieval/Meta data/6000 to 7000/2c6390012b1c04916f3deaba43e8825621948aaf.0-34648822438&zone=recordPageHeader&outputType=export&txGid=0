Methods: The authors conducted a case-crossover study in 50 US cities. They used daily mortality and weather data for 6 513 330 deaths occurring during 1989-2000. Exposure was assessed using two approaches. First, the authors determined exposure to extreme temperatures using city-specific indicator variables based on the local temperature distribution. Secondly, they used piecewise linear variables to assess exposure to temperature on a continuous scale above/below a threshold. Effects of hot and cold temperature were examined in season-specific models. In a meta-analysis of the city-specific results, the authors examined several city characteristics as effect modifiers. Results: Mortality increases associated with both extreme cold (2-day cumulative increase 1.59% (95% CI 0.56 to 2.63)) and extreme heat (5.74% (95% CI 3.38 to 8.15)) were found, the former being especially marked for myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest deaths. The increase in mortality was less marked at less extreme temperatures. The effect of extreme cold (defined as a percentile) was homogeneous across cities with different climates, suggesting that only the unusualness of the cold temperature (and not its absolute value) had a substantial impact on mortality (that is, acclimatisation to cold). Conversely, heat effects were quite heterogeneous, with the largest effects observed in cities with milder summers, less air conditioning and higher population density. Adjustment for ozone led to similar results, but some residual confounding could be present due to other uncontrolled pollutants. Conclusions: The authors confirmed in a large sample of cities that both cold and hot temperatures increase mortality risk. These findings suggest that increases in heat-related mortality due to global warming are unlikely to be compensated for by decreases in cold-related mortality and that population acclimatisation to heat is still incomplete.",,"article; cause of death; cold exposure; controlled study; heart arrest; heart infarction; human; major clinical study; mortality; priority journal; temperature acclimatization; temperature sensitivity; United States; Acclimatization; Air Conditioning; Cause of Death; Cold Temperature; Cross-Over Studies; Environmental Exposure; Global Warming; Heart Arrest; Hot Temperature; Humans; Myocardial Infarction; Ozone; Population Density; Seasons; United States; Weather",,"Ozone, 10028-15-6",,,,"Patz, J.A., Engelberg, D., Last, J., The effects of changing weather on public health (2000) Annu Rev Public Health, 21, pp. 271-307; Houghton, J.T., Ding, Y., Griggs, D.J., (2001) Climate change 2001: The scientific basis, , Contribution of Working Group I to the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panelon Climate Change IPCC, Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press; Wigley, T.M., Raper, S.C., Interpretation of high projections for global-mean warming (2001) Science, 293, pp. 451-454; Basu, R., Samet, J.M., Relation between elevated ambient temperature and mortality: A review of the epidemiologic evidence (2002) Epidemiol Rev, 24, pp. 190-202; Braga, A.L., Zanobetti, A., Schwartz, J., The time course of weather-related deaths (2001) Epidemiology, 12, pp. 062-067; McGeehin, M.A., Mirabelli, M., The potential impacts of climate variability and change on temperature-related morbidity ana mortality in the United States (2001) Environ Health Perspect, 109 (SUPPL. 2), pp. 185-189; Mercer, J.B., Cold - an underrated risk factor for health (2003) Environ Res, 92, pp. 8-13; Kalkstein, L.S., Greene, J.S., An evaluation of climate/mortality relationships in large U.S. cities and the possible impacts of a climate change (1997) Environ Health Perspect, 105, pp. 84-93; Keatinge, W.R., Donaldson, G.C., Cordioli, E., Heat related mortality in warm and cold regions of Europe: Observational study (2000) BMJ, 321, pp. 670-673; Braga, A.L., Zanobetti, A., Schwartz, J., The effect of weather on respiratory and cardiovascular deaths in 12 U.S. cities (2002) Environ Health Perspect, 110, pp. 859-863; Medina-Ramon, M., Zanobetti, A., Cavanagh, D.P., Extreme temperatures and mortality: Assessing effect modification by personal characteristics and specific cause of death in a multi-city case-only analysis (2006) Environ Health Perspect, 114, pp. 1331-1336; Cold exposure and winter mortality from ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, respiratory disease, and all causes in warm and cold regions of Europe (1997) Lancet, 349, pp. 1341-1346. , The Eurowinter Group; Curriero, F.C., Heiner, K.S., Samet, J.M., Temperature and mortality in 11 cities of the eastern United States (2002) Am J Epidemiol, 155, pp. 80-87; Maclure, M., The case-crossover design: A method for studying transient effects on the risk of acute events (1991) Am J Epidemiol, 133, pp. 144-153; Bateson, T.F., Schwartz, J., Control for seasonal variation and time trend in case-crossover studies of acute effects of environmental exposures (1999) Epidemiology, 10, pp. 539-544; Bateson, T.F., Schwartz, J., Selection bias and confounding in case-crossover analyses of environmental time-series data (2001) Epidemiology, 12, pp. 654-661; Schwartz, J., Assessing confounding, effect modification, and thresholds in the association between ambient particles and daily deaths (2000) Environ Health Perspect, 108, pp. 563-568; Department of Housing and Urban Development.
