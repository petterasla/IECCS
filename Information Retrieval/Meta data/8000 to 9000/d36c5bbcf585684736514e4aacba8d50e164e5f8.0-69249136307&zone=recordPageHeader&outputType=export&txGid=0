To gain much-needed further information on possible interspecies differences in seasonal patterns of photosynthesis, capacities for light- and CO2-saturated rates of oxygen evolution at 25°C (photosynthetic capacity) were determined during the summer-fall-winter transition for five conifer species over their natural distribution along a steep altitudinal gradient. Findings include (i) a transient upregulation of photosynthetic capacity during the summer-to-fall transition in all five conifer species that preceded the previously reported winter downregulation in conifers. However, there were (ii) interspecific differences in this response at the highest altitudes, with higher maximal photosynthetic capacities displayed by pine and spruce species compared to fir species. Lastly, the winter downregulation of photosynthetic capacity was not as complete in the present study (winter of 2006) as that which has been reported for previous winter seasons, which has implications for the winter survival strategy of conifers in response to global warming.",,"acclimation; altitudinal zonation; carbon budget; carbon sink; coniferous tree; food chain; global warming; interspecific variation; photosynthesis; seasonality; survival; Abies; Coniferophyta; Picea",,,,,,"Adams III, W.W., Hoehn, A., Demmig-Adams, B., Chilling temperatures and the xanthophyll cycle.
