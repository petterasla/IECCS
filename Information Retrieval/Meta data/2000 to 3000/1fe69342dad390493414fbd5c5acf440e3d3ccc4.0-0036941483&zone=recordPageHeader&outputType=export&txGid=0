Using multiple regression models of progressively increasing complexity, the analysis first accounted for variation in tree abundance attributable to both environment and regional-scale distributional disjunctions of likely historic origin. Intra-generic competition, expressed as variation in tree abundance dependent on the presence or absence of each congener, was then assessed by adding (1) simple terms to assess the magnitude of gross changes in abundance, and (2) interaction terms to assess variation in abundance along the dominant temperature gradient given different competitive contexts. Results indicate the presence of substantial intra-generic interactions, with simple interaction terms giving marginal increases in explained deviance equal to that explained by initial regressions using environment alone. Addition of interaction terms brought about smaller improvements in model fit, but confirm that variation in abundance along the dominant annual temperature gradient is strongly influenced by the competitive context provided by the remaining congeners. Such results are consistent with current understanding of the niche concept, and underline the difficulty inherent in using current species limits to predict likely changes in species distributions consequent on global warming.","Competitive interaction; Environment; Facilitation; Forest; Inter-specific; Mutualism; Niche","abundance; climate; competition (ecology); forest ecosystem; landform; multiple regression; prediction; New Zealand; Fagus; Nothofagus",,,,,,"Aarssen, L.W., Epp, G.A., Neighbour manipulations in natural vegetation: A review (1990) Journal of Vegetation Science, 1, pp. 13-30; Austin, M.P., Meyers, J.A., Current approaches to modelling the environmental niche of eucalypts: Implications for management of forest biodiversity (1996) Forest Ecology and Management, 85, pp. 95-106; Austin, M.P., Smith, T.M., A new model for the continuum concept (1989) Vegetatio, 83, pp. 35-47; Baylis, G.T.S., Mycorrhizas and the spread of beech (1980) New Zealand Journal of Ecology, 3, pp. 151-153; Borcard, D., Legendre, P., Environmental control and spatial structure in ecological communities: An example using oribatid mites (Acari, Oribatei) (1994) Environmental and Ecological Statistics, 1, pp. 37-61; Burrows, C.J., (1990) Processes of Vegetation Change, , Unwin Hyman, Boston, Massachusetts; Callaway, R.M., Positive interactions among plants (1995) Botanical Review, 61, pp. 306-349; Davis, M.B., Lags in vegetation response to greenhouse warming (1989) Climatic Change, 15, pp. 75-82; Hastie, T., Tibshirani, R.J., (1990) Generalized Additive Models, , Chapman & Hall, London; Hutchinson, G.E., Concluding remarks (1957) Cold Spring Harbour Symposia on Quantitative Biology, 22, pp. 415-427; Keddy, P.A., (1989) Competition, , Chapman & Hall, London; Keddy, P.A., Assembly and response rules: Two goals for predictive community ecology (1992) Journal of Vegetation Science, 3, pp. 157-164; Landsberg, J.J., (1986) Physiological Ecology of Forest Production, , Academic Press, London; Leathwick, J.R., Climatic relationships of some New Zealand forest tree species (1995) Journal of Vegetation Science, 6, pp. 237-248; Leathwick, J.R., Are New Zealand's Nothofagus species in equilibrium with their environment?
