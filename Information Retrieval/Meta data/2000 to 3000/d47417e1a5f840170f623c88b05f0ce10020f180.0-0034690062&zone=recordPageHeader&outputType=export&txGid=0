These predictions assume, however, that decay constants can be accurately derived from short-term laboratory incubations of soil or that in situ incubations of fresh litter accurately represent the temperature sensitivity of C(s) decomposition. But our limited understanding of the biophysical factors that control C(s) decomposition rates, and observations of only minor increases in C(s) decomposition rate with temperature in longer-term forest soil heating experiments and in latitudinal comparisons of C(s) decomposition rates bring these predictions into question. Here we have compiled C(s) decomposition data from 82 sites on five continents. We found that C(s) decomposition rates were remarkably constant across a global-scale gradient in mean annual temperature. These data suggest that C(s) decomposition rates for forest soils are not controlled by temperature limitations to microbial activity, and that increased temperature alone will not stimulate the decomposition of forest-derived carbon in mineral soil.",,"carbon; mineral; decomposition; organic carbon; soil carbon; temperature; article; climate; decomposition; enzyme activity; forest; greenhouse effect; heating; priority journal; reaction time; soil; temperature; total organic carbon; vegetation; Carbon; Minerals; Soil; Temperature; Trees",,"Carbon, 7440-44-0; Minerals; Soil",,,,,"Giardina, C.P.; Dept. of Nat.
