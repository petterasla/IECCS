Projections vary, but even the most optimistic do not predict much more than 20 years. For this reason we need to start looking very seriously at ways we can fuel our vehicles in a post-crude-oil future. Hydrogen is a popular option, but is it a realistic one? Don't the Brazilians run their cars on alcohol? Is that a strategy we could apply world wide? And what about battery-powered vehicles? Is that just for golf carts? The answer, as it turns out, is not to go for a single option, rather we will have to employ a combination of some of these technologies to keep us on the road. © 2008 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.
