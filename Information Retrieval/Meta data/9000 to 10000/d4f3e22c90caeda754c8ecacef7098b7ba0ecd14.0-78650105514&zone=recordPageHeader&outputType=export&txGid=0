In this work, recycling of automotive aluminum is reviewed to highlight environmental benefits of aluminum recycling, use of aluminum alloys in automotive applications, automotive recycling process, and new technologies in aluminum scrap process. Literature survey shows that newly developed techniques such as laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and solid state recycling provide promising alternatives in aluminum scrap process. Compared with conventional remelting and subsequent refinement, solid state recycling utilizing compression and extrusion at room or moderate temperature can result in significant energy savings and higher metal yield. © 2010 The Nonferrous Metals Society of China.","automotive aluminum; mechanical separation; recycling; solid state recycling; sorting","Aluminum production; Aluminum recycling; Aluminum scraps; Automotive aluminum; Automotive applications; Automotive recycling; Economic and environmental benefits; Energy saving; Environmental benefits; Literature survey; Mechanical separation; Metal yield; Moderate temperature; New technologies; Secondary aluminum; solid state recycling; Aluminum; Global warming; Metal extrusion; Recycling; Spectroscopic analysis; Scrap metal reprocessing",,,,,,"(2007) Alumimium in Cars [R], , European Aluminium Association; (2007) Improving Sustainability in the Transport Sector Through Weight Reduction and the Application of Aluminum [R], , International Aluminium Institute; Miller, W.S., Zhuang, L., Bottema, J., Wittebrood, A.J., De Smet, P., Haszler, A., Vieregge, A., Recent development in aluminum alloys for the automotive industry (2000) Materials Science and Engineering A, 280 (1), pp. 37-49. , DOI 10.1016/S0921-5093(99)00653-X; The global aluminum industry: Review and forecast [J] (2006) JOM, 58 (11), p. 10. , Anonymous; Das, S.K., Yin, W., The worldwide aluminum economy: The current state of the industry [J] (2007) JOM, 59 (11), pp. 57-63; Das, S.K., Jerry Long III, W., Wayne Hayden, H., Green, J.A.S., Junt, W.H.J.R., Energy implications of the changing world of aluminum metal supply [J] (2004) JOM, 56 (8), pp. 14-17; Rombach, G., (1998) Integrated Assessment of Primary and Secondary Aluminium Production [M], , DMG Business Media.
