We apply the PAGE model to assess the merits of policies to prevent global warming (by controlling the emissions of greenhouse gases), and policies to adapt to any global warming that occurs. The results confirm that it is difficult to overcome the problem of global warming by taking preventive action alone. The argument for introducing an aggressive adaptive policy is very strong. We calculate the valuation that would have to be placed upon non-economic environmental and social impacts, for a combined strategy of preventive and adaptive policies to be considered a worthwhile option, both for individual regions and for the world as a whole. We also show that uncertainties in all four groups of inputs to the model (scientific, costs of control, costs of adaptation and valuation of impacts) have a great influence on the costs and impacts of the combined strategy. © 1993.","Greenhouse effect; Modelling; Uncertainty","climatic change; global warming; greenhouse effect; model application; PAGE model; policy analysis; Air pollution control; Calculations; Costs; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Gas emissions; Geographical regions; Mathematical models; Public policy; Global warming; Greenhouse gas; Policy analysis of the greenhouse effect; Uncertainty; Greenhouse effect",,,,,,"Houghton, Jenkins, Ephraums, (1990) Climate Change: The IPCC Scientific Assessment, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Joint ministerial declaration on CO2 emissions (1990) Europe Environment, (352), p. 8. , section 1; Fighting against the greenhouse effect by imposing a levy on non-renewable energies (1991) Europe Environment, (368), p. 1. , section 5; Nordhaus, Greenhouse economics: count before you leap (1990) The Economist, pp. 19-22; Mors, The Economics of Policies to Stabilize or Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions: The Case of CO2 (1991) Economic paper 87, , 2nd edition, Commission of the European Communities, Brussels; Hope, A Fast and Simple Model of Global Warming from Greenhouse Gas Emissions (1992) University of Cambridge Research Papers in Management Studies; Eurostat, (1989) Europe in Figures, , Gross domestic product in the EC in 1987 was ECU 3.7 trillion, 2nd edition, HMSO, London; Randall, Total and non-use values (1991) Measuring the Demand for Environmental Quality, , J.B.
