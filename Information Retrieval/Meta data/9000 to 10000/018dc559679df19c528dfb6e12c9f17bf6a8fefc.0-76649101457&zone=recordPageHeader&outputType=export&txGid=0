In a near-term climate prediction covering the period up to 2030, we require knowledge of the future state of internal variations in the climate system such as the PDO as well as the global warming signal. We perform sets of ensemble hindcast and forecast experiments using a coupled atmosphere-ocean climate model to examine the predictability of internal variations on decadal timescales, in addition to the response to external forcing due to changes in concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols, volcanic activity, and solar cycle variations. Our results highlight that an initialization of the upper-ocean state using historical observations is effective for successful hindcasts of the PDO and has a great impact on future predictions. Ensemble hindcasts for the 20th century demonstrate a predictive skill in the upper-ocean temperature over almost a decade, particularly around the Kuroshio-Oyashio extension (KOE) and subtropical oceanic frontal regions where the PDO signals are observed strongest. A negative tendency of the predicted PDO phase in the coming decade will enhance the rising trend in surface air-temperature (SAT) over east Asia and over the KOE region, and suppress it along the west coasts of North and South America and over the equatorial Pacific. This suppression will contribute to a slowing down of the global-mean SAT rise.","Climate change; Data assimilation; Decadal prediction; Decadal variability; Global warming","air temperature; article; climate change; controlled study; forecasting; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; North America; pacific decadal oscillation; Pacific Ocean; prediction; priority journal; salinity; sea surface temperature; solar cycle; South America",,,,,,"Cox, P.M., Stephenson, D., A changing climate for prediction (2007) Science, 317, pp. 207-208; Hibbard, K.A., Meehl, G.A., Cox, P.M., Friedlingstein, P., A strategy for climate change stabilization experiments (2007) EOS, 88, pp. 217-219; Murphy, J.M., Quantification of modelling uncertainties in a large ensemble of climate change simulations (2004) Nature, 430, pp. 768-772; Barnett, D.N., Quantifying uncertainty in changes in extreme event frequency in response to doubled CO2 using a large ensemble of GCM simulations (2006) Clim Dynam, 26, pp. 489-511; Clark, R., Brown, S.J., Murphy, J.M., Modelling Northern Hemisphere summer heat extreme changes and their uncertainties using a physics ensemble of climate sensitivity experiments (2006) J Climate, 19, pp. 4418-4435; Shiogama, H., Nozawa, T., Emori, S., Robustness of climate change signals in near term predictions up to the year 2030: Changes in the frequency of temperature extremes (2007) Geophys Res Lett, 34, pp. L12714. , doi:10.1029/ 2007GL029318; Stott, P.A., Kettleborough, J.A., Origins and estimates of uncertainty in predictions of twenty first century temperature rise (2002) Nature, 416, pp. 723-726; Meehl, G.A., (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Scientific Basis.
