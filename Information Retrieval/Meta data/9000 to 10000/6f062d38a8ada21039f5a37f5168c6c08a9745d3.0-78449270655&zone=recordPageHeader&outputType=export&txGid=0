Simulation has been done using EdGCM model software (with available 8 × 10 resolution) developed at Columbia University on which there have been produced global precipitation maps for the seasonal and annual averages for the last 5 years (2096-2100). For each map, EdGCM grid values surrounding Saudi Arabia are used as input to one of the tools of Eagle point software called surface modelling (SM). SM is a new approach for downscaling global climate model results. SM software modelled out isohyets at 0.2mm/day interval. The results indicate that the present pattern of precipitation (more in winter and less in summer) is going to change by almost equal occurrence of precipitation in all seasons for double_CO2 (2CO2)experiment.The2CO2 experiment indicates an increase of about 16.05% over the annual average precipitation across the country. © 2010 Taylor &amp; Francis.","Downscaling; Edgcm; Ghgs; Isohyets; Precipitation; Surface modelling","Down-scaling; Edgcm; Ghgs; Isohyets; Precipitation; Surface modelling; Climate models; Computer simulation; Global warming; Computer software; climate modeling; computer simulation; downscaling; global climate; global warming; greenhouse gas; precipitation (climatology); software; Saudi Arabia",,,,,,"Carpenter, T.M., Georgakakos, K.P., Assessment of Folsom lake response to historical and potential future climate scenarios: 1. forecasting (2001) Journal of Hydrology, 249 (1-4), pp. 148-175; Chandler, M., (2007) The Basic Guide to EdGCM (Version 3.1), , USA: Columbia University; Davidson, O.R., Climate change mitigation (2007) AR4 of IPCC, , Cambridge/NewYork: Cambridge University Press; Dettinger, M.D., From climate change spaghetti to climate change distributions for 21st century (2005) San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science, 3 (1), pp. 1-14. , http://repositories.cdlib.org/jmie/sfews/vol3/iss1/art4, Article 4, Available from; Dettinger, M.D., Simulated hydrologic responses to climate variations and change in the Merced, Carson, and American river basins, Sierra Nevada, California, 1900-2099 (2004) Climatic Change, 62 (1-3), pp. 283-317; Georgakakos, K.P., Integrating climate-hydrology forecasts and multi-objective reservoir management for Northern California (2005) Eos, Transactions, American Geophysical Union, 86 (12); Hansen, J., Efficient three-dimensional global models for climate studies: Models I and II (1983) Monthly Weather Review, 3 (4), pp. 609-662; Hayhoe, K., Emissions pathways, climate change, and impacts on California (2004) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), 101 (34), pp. 12422-12427; Kang, B., Jorge, A.R., Response of stream flow to weather variability under climate change in the Colorado Rockies (2007) Journal of Hydrologic Engineering, 12 (1), pp. 63-72; Kim, J., A projection of the climate change induced by increased CO2 on extreme hydrologic events in the Western US (2005) Climatic Change, 68 (1-2), pp. 153-168; Knowles, N., Cayan, D.R., Elevational dependence of projected hydrologic changes in the San Francisco estuary and watershed (2004) Climatic Change, 62, pp. 319-336; Leung, L.R., Mid-century ensemble regional climate change scenarios for theWestern United States (2004) Climatic Change, 62, pp. 75-113; Maurer, E.P., Duffy, P.B., Uncertainty in projections of stream flow changes due to climate change in California (2005) Geophysical Research Letters, 32 (3), pp. 1-5; Miller, N.L., Bashford, K.E., Strem, E., Potential impacts of climate change on California hydrology (2003) Journal of the American Water Resources Association, 39 (4), pp. 771-784; Singh, V.P., (1992) Elementary Hydrology, pp. 332-334. , Chapter 4.
