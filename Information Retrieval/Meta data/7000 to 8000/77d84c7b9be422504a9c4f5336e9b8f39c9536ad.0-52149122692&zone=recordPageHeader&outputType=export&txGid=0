The climate change of near-surface wind energy potential in China under the background of global warming and its association with anthropogenic land-use changes are investigated by calculating the difference in surface wind speeds between the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data and the observations since the re-analysis dataset contains the influence of large-scale climate changes due to greenhouse gases, it is less sensitive to regional surface processes associated with land types. The surface wind data in this study consist of long-term observations from 604 Chinese Roution Meteorological Stations and the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data from 1960-1999. The results suggest that the observed mean wind speeds significantly weakened and the near-surface wind power trended downward due to urbanization and other land-use changes in the last 40 years. The mean wind energy weakened by -3.84 W•m-2 per decade due to the influence of anthropogenic land-use change, which is close to the observed climate change (-4.51 W•m-2/10 a). © 2008 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.","Anthropogenic land-use changes; Climate change; Wind energy",,,,,,,"Pryor, S.C., Barthelmie, R.J., Long term trends in near surface flow over the Baltic (2003) Int J Climatol, 23, pp. 271-289; Pryor, S.C., Barthelmie, R.J., Kjellström, Potential climate change impact on wind energy resources in northern Europe: Analyses using a regional climate model (2005) Clim Dyn, 25, pp. 815-835; Wang, Z.Y., Ding, Y.H., He, J.H., An updating analysis of the climate change in China in the recent 50 years (2004) Acta Meteor Sin (In Chinese), 62, pp. 228-236. , 2; Zuo, H.C., D, L.L., Hu, Y.Q., Characteristics of climatic trends and correlation between pan-evaporation and environmental factors in the last 40 years over China (2005) Chin Sci Bull, 50, pp. 1235-1241. , 12; Ren, G.Y., Guo, J., Xu, M.Z., Climate changes of China's mainland over past half century (2005) Acta Meteor Sin (In Chinese), 63, pp. 942-956. , 6; Wang, Y.J., Zhou, X.L., Ni, S.X., Analysis on climate change in the region of Qinghai Lake in the last 40 years (2003) J Nanjing Inst Meteor (In Chinese), 26, pp. 228-235. , 2; Li, Z.C., Wei, Z.G., Gao, R.R., Spatial and temporal characters of surface wind in Gansu corridor oasis in the recent 50 years (2004) Plateau Meteor (In Chinese), 23, pp. 259-263. , 2; Liu, J.X., Jiang, C.B., Fan, X.W., The climate change tendency and the abnormal characters of the yellow river delta in recent 40 years (2002) Mar Forecasts (In Chinese), 19, pp. 31-35. , 2; Li, Y., Wang, Y., Tang, J.P., Temporal and spatial variety characteristics in near-surface wind energy in China (2007) J Nanjing Uni (Natural Sciences) (In Chinese), 43, pp. 61-72. , 3; (2002) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis Contribution of Working Group i to the Third Assessment Report of the International Panel on Climate Change, , Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Chang.
