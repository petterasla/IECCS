These changes have been predicted to impact the distribution and abundance of wildlife species relying on willow thickets as habitat. We assessed the relation between variables quantifying willow thicket configuration and population dynamics of tundra voles (Microtus oeconomus) in three riparian regions in Finnmark, northern Norway, which were subject to intense browsing by semi-domesticated reindeer. The tundra vole, which exhibits 5-year population cycles in Finnmark, is the dominant small rodent species in riparian landscape elements in southern arctic tundra. In the course of a 4-year trapping study, tundra vole populations went through the cyclic phases of increase, peak and crash, however, with distinct differences between the three regions in the population dynamics. Within regions, the occupancy pattern during the increase phase was positively related to willow thicket configuration (in particular edge density and willow height) only in the region attaining the highest abundance and occupancy. However, local abundance was not clearly related to habitat features within any regions. The lack of consistency in the response of tundra vole populations to willow thicket configuration, as well as the positive relation between the degree of thicket shredding and tundra vole habitat occupancy in one of the regions, indicates that tundra voles will not be much affected by climate or browsing induced changes in the shrubbiness of the tundra in the future. © 2010 The Author(s).","Abundance; Fragmentation; Large-scale study; Occupancy; Over-browsing; Shrub expansion","abundance; arctic environment; browsing; deciduous tree; deer; global warming; habitat fragmentation; population cycle; population dynamics; range expansion; rodent; shrub; tundra; Finnmark; Norway; Microtus oeconomus; Muridae; Rangifer tarandus; Rodentia; Salix",,,,,,"Andreassen, H.P., Hertzberg, K., Ims, R.A., Space-use responses to habitat fragmentation and connectivity in the root vole Microtus oeconomus (1998) Ecology, 79, pp. 1223-1235; Angerbjörn, A., Tannerfeldt, M., Lundberg, H., Geographical and temporal patterns of lemming population dynamics in Fennoscandia (2001) Ecography, 24, pp. 298-308; Bates, D., Maechler, M., Dai, B., (2008) Lme4: Linear mixed-effects models using s4 classes (version 0. 999375-20), [computer software], , http://cran.R-project.Org/, Available at; Batzli, G.O., Henttonen, H., Demography and resource use by microtine rodents near Toolik lake, Alaska, USA (1990) Arct Alp Res, 22, pp. 51-64; Batzli, G.O., White, R.G., Maclean, S.F., Pitelka, F.A., Collier, B., The Herbivore-Based Trophic System (1980) An Arctic Ecosystem: The Coastal Tundra at Barrow, pp. 335-410. , Brown J, Miller PC, Tieszen LL, Bunnell FL (Eds), Alaska, Stroudsburg (PA): Dowden, Hutchinson, and Ross; Bliss, L., Arctic ecosystems of North America (1997) Ecosystems of the World 3.
