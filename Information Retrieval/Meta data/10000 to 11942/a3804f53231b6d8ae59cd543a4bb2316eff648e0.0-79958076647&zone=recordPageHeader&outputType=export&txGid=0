Distributed generation using diesel generators remains a common means of electricity provision for rural communities throughout the world. Due to rising fuel costs, the need to address poverty, and consequences of global warming, it is necessary to develop cost efficient means of reducing fossil fuel consumption in isolated diesel microgrids. Based on a case study in Nicaragua, a set of demand and supply side measures are ordered by their annualized costs in order to approximate an energy supply curve. The curve highlights significant opportunities for reducing the costs of delivering energy services while also transitioning to a carbon-free electrical system. In particular, the study demonstrates the significant cost savings resulting from the implementation of conventional metering, efficient residential lighting, and electricity generation using renewable energy sources. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy efficiency; Renewable energy technologies; Rural electrification","Cost saving; Cost-efficient; Demand and supply; Diesel generators; Electrical systems; Electricity generation; Energy services; Energy supplies; Fuel cost; Low-carbon; Mechanical energies; Micro grid; Nicaragua; Poverty alleviation; Renewable energy source; Renewable energy technologies; Residential lighting; Rural community; Rural electrification; Rural energy; Distributed power generation; Electric generators; Electric utilities; Electricity; Energy efficiency; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Rural areas; Cost reduction; demand-side management; electricity generation; energy efficiency; energy use; implementation process; poverty alleviation; renewable resource; rural electrification; rural energy; Nicaragua",,,,,,"(2009), http://www.adelaide.edu.au/biogas/anaerobic_digestion/casestudy.pdf, Arias, Joaquin Viquez, Case Study: Technical and Economic Feasibility of Electricity Generation with Biogas in Costa RicaBaring-Gould, E.I., Barley, C.D., Drouilhet, S., (1997), Diesel plant retrofitting options to enhance decentralized electricity supply in Indonesia.
