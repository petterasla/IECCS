The characteristics of the SWI variation in global continents, such as North America, South America, Eurasia, Africa, and Australia, were compared. In addition, the correlation between the SWI variation of each continent (or across the globe) and the large-scale background closely related to SST variations, which affects climate change, was analyzed. The results indicate that the SWI variation shows distinct regional characteristics in the second half of the 20th century under global warming. A drying trend in the last 52 years occurred in Africa, Eurasia, Australia and South America, most obviously in Africa and Eurasia. North America shows a wetting trend after 1976. A 30-year period of dry-wet oscillation is found in South America and Australia; the latest is in a drying period in two regions. The results also revealed that global warming has changed the dry-wet pattern of the global land. South America and Australia have a drying trend despite increases in precipitation. This indicates that increases in surface air temperature cannot be ignored in aridification studies. Global dry-wet variation is closely related to large-scale SST variations: the drying trend in Africa and Eurasia and the wetting trend in North America are correlated with Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO); the interdecadal oscillation of SWI in South America and Australia is consistent with the interdecadal variation in Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). © Science in China Press 2007.","Correlation; Drying trend; Global dry-wet variation; Interdecadal variation; Large-scale background","Atmospheric movements; Atmospheric temperature; Global warming; Oceanography; Interdecadal variation; Pacific decadal oscillation; Southern oscillation index; Surface wetness index; Meteorology; air temperature; aridification; climate change; data set; decadal variation; global warming; Pacific Decadal Oscillation; precipitation (climatology); sea surface temperature; Southern Oscillation; twentieth century",,,,,,"Nicholson, S.E., Climatic and environmental change in Africa during the last two centuries (2001) Clim Res, 17, pp. 123-144; Dai, A.G., Trenberth, K.T., Qian, T.T., A global dataset of Palmer drought severity index for 1870-2002: Relationship with soil moisture and effects of surface warming (2004) J Hydrometeor, 5, pp. 1117-1130; Zhang, Q.Y., Chen, L.T., Variations of dryness and wetness in China during 1951-1980 (1991) Sci Atmos Sin, 15 (5), pp. 72-81. , (in Chinese); Zhang, Q.Y., Wei, J., Tao, S.Y., The decadal and interannual variations of drought in the northern China and association with the circulations (2003) Clim Environ Res, 8 (3), pp. 307-318. , (in Chinese); Bordi, I., Fraedrich, K., Gerstengarbe, F.W., Potential predictability of dry and wet periods: Sicily and Elbe-Basin (Germany) (2004) Theor Appl Climatol, 77, pp. 125-138; Nicholson, N., The changing nature of Australian drought (2004) Clim Change, 63, pp. 323-336; Tolika, K., Maheras, P., Spatial and temporal characteristics of wet spells in Greece (2005) Theor Appl Climatol, 81, pp. 71-85; Bordi, I., Fraedrich, K., Jiang, J.M., Spatio-temporal variability of dry and wet periods in eastern China (2006) Theor Appl Climatol, 79, pp. 81-91; Ma, Z.G., Fu, C.B., Interannual characteristics of the surface hydrological variables over the arid and semi-arid areas of northern China (2003) Glob Planet Change, 37, pp. 189-200; Ma, Z.G., Fu, C.B., Dan, L., Decadal variations of arid and semi-arid boundary in China (2005) Chin J Geophys, 48 (3), pp. 574-581; Ma, Z.G., Dan, L., Dry/wet variation and its relationship with regional warming in arid regions of northern China (2005) Chin J Geophys, 48 (5), pp. 1091-1099; Palmer, W.C., (1965) Meteorologic Drought, p. 58. , U.
