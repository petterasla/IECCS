Effective mitigation action requires comprehension of the scale of the problem. Data limitations, however, have thus far constrained efforts to understand how changes in demographics, travel behavior, and policy might affect future emissions of greenhouse gases. This study uses recently available data on city-level travel patterns to forecast emissions from passenger transport for three metropolitan areas in India: Mumbai, Ahmedabad, and Surat. The forecasts compare carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for three scenarios by using various mode choice and trip length assumptions. The results predict dramatic increases in emissions under all circumstances. Travel in Surat is forecast to generate between 1.9 and 9.5 million tons of CO2; in Mumbai, travel could generate 10.3 to 49 million tons. Differences, however, between scenarios suggest the potential positive effects of policy interventions. While the results help convey the magnitude of the emissions problem, further analysis requires more complete data on individual travel behavior.",,"Carbon dioxide emissions; Data limitations; Global climate changes; Metropolitan area; Mode choice; Passenger transport; Policy intervention; Positive effects; Rapid urban development; Travel activities; Travel behaviors; Travel patterns; Carbon dioxide; Forecasting; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Transportation",,,,,,"Bose, R., Nesamani, K.S., (2000) Urban Transport, Energy and Environment: A Case of Delhi, , Institute of Transportation Studies, University of California, Davis; Das, A., Parikh, J., Transport scenarios in two metropolitan cities in India: Delhi and Mumbai (2004) Energy Conversion and Management, 45 (15-16), pp. 2603-2625; Fabian, B., Gota, S., (2009) Emissions from India's Intercity and Intracity Road Transport, , http://www.cleanairinitiative.org/portal/node/3549, Clean Air Initiative Asia Center; Schipper, L., Banerjee, I., Ng, W.-S., Carbon dioxide emissions from land transport in India: Scenarios of the uncertain (2009) Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board, pp. 28-37. , 2114, Transportation Research Board of the National Academies, Washington, D.C; Singh, S.K., Future mobility in India: Implications for energy demand and CO 2 emission (2006) Transport Policy, 13 (5), pp. 398-412. , DOI 10.1016/j.tranpol.2006.03.001, PII S0967070X06000199; (2006) Bus Rapid Transit System, Ahmedabad-Final Report, , Centre for Environmental Planning and Technology (CEPT), CEPT, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India; (2008) Surat Comprehensive Mobility Plan and Bus Rapid Transit System Plan: Detailed Project Report, , CEPT, CEPT, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India; Lea Associates.
