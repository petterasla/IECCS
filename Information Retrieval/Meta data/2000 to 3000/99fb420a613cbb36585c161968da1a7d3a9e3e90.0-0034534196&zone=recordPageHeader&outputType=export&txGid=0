However, a rapid and accurate method to study the CH4 transport capacity (MTC) of rice plants is not available. We developed a gas sampling and analytical device based on a closed two-compartment chamber technique and analyzed the enrichment of the CH4 mixing ratio inside the shoot compartment of cylindrical cuvettes enclosing individual rice plants under ambient conditions. The computer-controlled analytical system consists of a gas chromatograph (GC) and a pressure-controlled autosampler for eight cuvettes (seven for plants and one for CH4-calibration gas). The system automates closure and opening of plant cuvettes using pneumatic pressure, air sample collection and injection into the GC, and CH4 analysis. It minimizes sources of error during air sampling by continuously mixing headspace air of each cuvette, maintaining pressure and composition of the headspace inside the cuvettes, purging the dead volumes between the sampler induction tube and GC, and running a reference CH4-calibration gas sample in each cycle. Tests showed that the automated system is a useful tool for accurate sampling of headspace air of cylindrical cuvettes enclosing individual rice plants and enables rapid and accurate fully automated analysis of CH4 in the headspace air samples. A linear relationship was obtained between CH4 transported by rice plants of two cultivars (IR72, a high-yielding dwarf, and Dular, a traditional tall cultivar) and concentration of CH4 up to 7,500 ppm used for purging the nutrient culture solution surrounding the roots in the root compartment of the chamber. Further increase in CH4 emission by shoots was not observed at 10,000 ppm CH4 concentration in the root compartment of the chamber. The MTC of IR72 was measured at six development stages; it was lowest at seedling stage, increasing gradually until panicle initiation. There was no further change at flowering, but a marked decrease at maturity was noted. These results suggest that the plants have 45-246% greater potential to transport CH4 than the highest CH4 emission rates reported under field conditions, and plants would not emit CH4 at early growth and at a reduced rate close to ripening.","Automated methane measurements; Global warming; Greenhouse effects; Methane emissions; Plant growth stages; Plant-mediated gas transfer; Rhizosphere; Rice cultivars",,,,,,,"Achtnich, C., Bak, F., Conrad, R., Competition for electron donors among nitrate reducers, ferric iron reducers, sulfate producers and methanogens in anoxic paddy soil (1995) Biol Fertil Soils, 19, pp. 65-72; Bartolome, V.I., Casumpang, R.M., Ynalvez, M.A.H., Olea, A.B., McLaren, C.G., (1999) IRRISTAT for Windows - Statistical software for agricultural research, , Biometrics, International Rice Research Institute, Makati City, Philippines; Blake, D.R., Rowland, F.S., Continuing worldwide increase in tropospheric methane, 1978 to 1987 (1988) Science, 239, pp. 1129-1131; Buendia, L.V., Neue, H.U., Wassmann, R., Lantin, R.S., Javellana, A.M., Yuchang, X., Makarim, A.K., Charoensilp, N., Understanding the nature of methane emission from rice ecosystems as basis of mitigation strategies (1997) Appl Energy, 56, pp. 433-444; Butterbach-Bahl, K., Papen, H., Rennenberg, H., Impact of gas transport through rice cultivars on methane emission from paddy fields (1997) Plant Cell Environ, 20, pp. 1175-1183; Cicerone, R.J., Shetter, J.D., Sources of atmospheric methane: Measurements in rice paddies and a discussion (1981) J Geophys Res, 86, pp. 7203-7209; Cochran, W.G., Cox, G.M., (1950) Experimental Designs, , John Wiley and Sons, Inc, New York; Van der Gon, H.A.C.D., Neue, H.U., Influence of organic matter incorporation on the methane emission from a wetland rice field (1995) Global Biogeochem Cycles, 9, pp. 11-22; Dlugokencky, E., Steele, P., Lang, P.M., Tans, P., Masaire, K., The growth rate and distribution of atmospheric methane (1994) J Geophys Res, 99, pp. 17021-17043; Etheridge, D.M., Pearman, G.I., Fraser, P.J., Changes in tropospheric methane between 1841 and 1978 from a high accumulation rate Antarctic ice core (1992) Tellus, 44, pp. 282-294; Holzapfel-Pschorn, A., Conrad, R., Seiler, W., Effects of vegetation on the emission of methane from submerged paddy soil (1986) Plant Soil, 92, pp. 223-391; Holzapfel-Pschorn, A., Seiler, W., Methane emission during a cultivation period from an Italian rice paddy (1986) J Geophy Res, 91, pp. 11803-11814; (1992) Climate Change: The Supplementary Report to the IPCC Scientific Assessment, , Houghton JT, Callander BA & Varney SK (eds) IPCC, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; (1995) Climate Change: The Science of Climate Change, , Houghton JT, Meira Filho LG, Callander BA, Harris N, Kattenberg A, Maskell K (eds) IPCC, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Neue, H.U., Sass, R., The budget of methane from rice fields (1998) IGAC tivities, 17, pp. 3-11; Nouchi, I., Mariko, S., Aoki, K., Mechanism of methane transport from the rhizosphere to the atmosphere through rice plants (1990) Plant Physiol, 94, pp. 59-66; Nouchi, I., Mariko, S., Mechanism of methane transport by rice plants (1993), pp. 336-352. , Oremland RS (ed).
