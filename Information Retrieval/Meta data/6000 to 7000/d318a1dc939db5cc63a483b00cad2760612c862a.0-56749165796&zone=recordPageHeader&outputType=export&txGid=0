There is an ever increasing demand for production equipments in foundries that are more human friendly and environmentally cleaner. To meet such needs, a new type green sand moulding machine employing 'aeration' sand filling process has been developed. In order to make further improvements in moulding performance, new technologies, squeeze balance control and synchronised cope and drag pattern drawing technology, applied in squeezing and mould stripping process of the flaskless moulding equipment has been developed. Adoption of the squeeze balance control system achieves uniform mould strength and prevents distortion of pattern plates by automatically controlling the squeeze pressure applied to the cope and drag moulds in the squeeze process. This optimises the squeeze pressure according to the shape of the pattern. In this study the effectiveness of these technologies was proved by executing performance tests with an actual machine. © 2008 W. S.
