These trends are influenced both by interannual and decadal-scale climate variability, and also by temperature trends at longer time scates that are generally consistent with observations of global warming over the twentieth century. In this study, the linear trends in 1 April SWE over the western United States are examined, as simulated by the Variable Infiltration Capacity hydrologic model implemented at 1/8° latitude-longitude spatial resolution, and driven by a carefully quality controlled gridded daily precipitation and temperature dataset for the period 1915-2003. The long simulations of snowpack are used as surrogates for observations and are the basis for an analysis of regional trends in snowpack over the western United States and southern British Columbia, Canada. By isolating the trends due to temperature and precipitation in separate simulations, the influence of temperature and precipitation variability on the overall trends in SWE is evaluated. Downward trends in 1 April SWE over the western United States from 1916 to 2003 and 1947 to 2003, and for a time series constructed using two warm Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) epochs concatenated together, are shown to be primarily due to widespread warming. These temperature-related trends are not well explained by decadal climate variability associated with the PDO. Trends in SWE associated with precipitation trends, however, are very different in different time periods and are apparently largely controlled by decadal variability rather than longer-term trends in climate. © 2005 American Meteorological Society.",,"Global warming; Hydrology; Mathematical models; Meteorology; Precipitation (meteorology); Snow; Thermal effects; Time series analysis; Hydrologic model; Precipitation variability; Snow water equivalent (SWE); Snowpack; Climatology; air temperature; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; snowpack; North America; Pacific Coast [North America]; Pacific Coast [United States]; United States",,,,,,"Cayan, D.R., Interannual climate variability and snowpack in the western United States (1996) J.
