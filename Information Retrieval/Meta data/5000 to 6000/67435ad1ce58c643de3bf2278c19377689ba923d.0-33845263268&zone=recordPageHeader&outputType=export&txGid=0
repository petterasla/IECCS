The results show that: (1) Temperature can be completely decomposed into four timescales quasi-periodic oscillations including an ENSO-like mode, a 6-8-year signal, a 20-year signal and a 60-year signal, as well as a trend. With each contributing ration of the quasi-periodicity discussed, the trend and the 60-year timescale oscillation of temperature variation are the most prominent. (2) It has been noticed that whether on century-scale or 60-year scales, the global temperature tends to descend in the coming 20 years. (3) On quasi 60-year timescale, temperature abrupt changes in China precede those in the global and NH, which provides a denotation for global climate changes. Signs also show a drop in temperature in China on century scale in the next 20 years. (4) The dominant contribution of CO2 concentration to global temperature variation is the trend. However, its influence weight on global temperature variation accounts for no more than 40.19%, smaller than those of the natural climate changes on the rest four timescales. Despite the increasing trend in atmospheric CO2 concentration, the patterns of 20-year and 60-year oscillation of global temperature are all in falling. Therefore, if CO2 concentration remains constant at present, the CO2 greenhouse effect will be deficient in counterchecking the natural cooling of global climate in the following 20 years. Even though the CO2 greenhouse effect on global climate change is unsuspicious, it could have been excessively exaggerated. It is high time to re-consider the trend of global climate changes. © Springer-Verlag 2006.",,"air temperature; carbon dioxide; climate change; decomposition analysis; empirical analysis; global climate; greenhouse effect; temperature anomaly",,,,,,"Caldeira, K., Duffy, B.P., The role of the southern ocean in uptake and storage of anthropogeic carbon dioxide (2000) Science, 287, pp. 620-622; Etheridge, D.M., Pearman, G.I., Silva, F.D., Atmospheric trace-gas variations as revealed by air trapped in an ice core from Law Dome, Antarctica (1988) Ann Glaciol, 10, pp. 28-33; Etheridge, D.M., Steele, L.P., Langenfelds, R.L., Natural and anthropogenic changes in atmospheric CO2 over the last 1000 years from air in Antarctic ice and firn (1996) J Geophys Res, 101, pp. 4115-4128; Fischer, H., Wahlen, M., Smith, J., Ice core records of atmospheric CO2 around the last three glacial terminations (1999) Science, 283, pp. 1712-1714; Hao, J.P., Huang, D.J., Mirror extending and circular spline functions for Empirical Mode Decomposition method (2001) J Zhejiang Univ (Sci), 2, pp. 247-252; Houghton, J.T., (2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis, pp. 1-94. , Cambridge University Press; Huang, N.E., Shen, Z., Long, S.R., The empirical mode decomposition and the Hilbert spectrum for nonlinear and non-stationary time series analysis (1998) Proc R Soc Land A, 454, pp. 899-955; Huang, N.E., Shen, Z., Long, S.R., A new view of nonlinear water waves: The Hilbert spectrum (1999) Ann Rev Fluid Mech, 31, pp. 417-457; Jones, P.D., Hemispheric surface air temperature variations: A reanalysis and an update to 1993 (1994) J Climate, 7, pp. 1794-1802; Jones, P.D., Moberg, A., Hemispheric and large-scale surface air temperature variations: An extensive revision and an update to 2001 (2003) J Climate, 16, pp. 206-223; Jones, P.D., New, M., Parker, D.E., Surface air temperature and its variations over the last 150 years (1999) Rev Geophys, 37, pp. 173-199; Joos, F., Plattner, G.-K., Stocker, T.F., Global warming and marine carbon cycle feedbacks on future atmospheric CO2 (1999) Science, 284, pp. 464-467; Manabe, S., Stouffer, R.J., Century-scale effects of increased atmospheric CO2 on the ocean-atmosphere system (1993) Nature, 364, pp. 215-218; Manabe, S., Stouffer, R.J., Multiple-century response of a coupled ocean-atmosphere model to an increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide (1994) J Climate, 7, pp. 5-23; Michael, M.E., Jeffrey, P., Global interdecadal and century-scale climate oscillations during the past five centuries (1995) Nature, 378, pp. 266-270; Morgan, V.I., Wookey, C.W., Li, J., Site information and initial results from deep ice drilling on Law Dome (1997) J Glaciol, 43, pp. 3-10; Petit, J.R., Jouzel, J., Raynaud, D., Climate and atmosphere history of the past 420.000 years from the Vostok ice core, Antarctica (1999) Nature, 399, pp. 429-436; Sarmiento, J.L., Quere, C.L., Oceanic carbon dioxide uptake in a model of century-scale global warming (1996) Science, 274, pp. 1346-1350; Sarmiento, J.L., Hughes, T.M.C., Stouffer, R.J., Simulated response of the ocean carbon to anthropogenic climate warming (1998) Nature, 393, pp. 245-249; Schlesinger, M.E., Ramankutty, N., An oscillation in the global climate system of period 65-70 years (1994) Nature, 367, pp. 723-726; Schneider, T., Held, M.I., Discriminants of twentieth-century changes in earth surface temperatures (2001) J Climate, 14, pp. 249-254; Siegenthaler, U., Sarmiento, J.L., Atmosphere carbon dioxide and the ocean (1993) Nature, 365, pp. 119-125; Stauffer, B., Blunier, T., Dällenbach, A., Atmosphere CO2 concentration and millennial-scale climate change during the last glacial period (1998) Nature, 392, pp. 429-436; Stott, P.A., Kettleborough, J.A., Origins and estimates of uncertainty in predictions of twenty-first century temperature rise (2002) Nature, 416, pp. 723-726; Wang, S.W., Ye, Y.D., Gong, J.L., Construction of mean annual temperature series for the last one hundred years in China (1998) Quart J Appl Meteor, 19 (4), pp. 392-401","Zhen-Shan, L.; The School of Geographic Sciences, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China",,,,,,,,01777971,,,,"English","Meteorol.
