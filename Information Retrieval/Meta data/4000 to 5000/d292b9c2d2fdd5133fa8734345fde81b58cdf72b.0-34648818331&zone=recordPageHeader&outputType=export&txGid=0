We found that body size of the otters increased during the last quarter of the twentieth century, and suggest that this trend is related to increased food availability from fish farming and possibly also to energy saving due to elevated sea temperatures. Birth year and death year explained 38.8 and 43.5%, respectively, of the variation in body size. Body size of otters was positively related to latitude, thus conforming to Bergmann's rule. © Springer-Verlag 2006.","Bergmann's rule; Fish farming","Carnivora; Lutra lutra; Lutrinae; animal; article; body size; Carnivora; comparative study; diet; geography; greenhouse effect; Norway; physiology; regression analysis; Animals; Body Size; Diet; Geography; Greenhouse Effect; Norway; Otters; Regression Analysis",,,,,,"Resources and environment of the sea 2005 (in Norwegian with English summary) (2005) Fisk Havet, 2005, p. 1. , Anon; Aure, J., Strand, O., Hydrographic normals and long-term variations at fixed surface layer stations along the Norwegian coast from 1936 to 2000 (in Norwegian with English subtitles and abstract) (2001) Fisk Havet, 2001, p. 13; Carss, D.N., Shags Phalacrocorax aristotilis at cage fish farms in Argyll, Western Scotland (1993) Bird Study, 40, pp. 203-211; Dempster, T., Sanchez-Jerez, P., Bayle-Sepere, J., Kingsford, M., Extensive aggregations of wild fish at coastal seacage fish farms (2004) Hydrobiology, 525, pp. 245-248; Esmark, M., Stensland, S., Lilleeng, M.S., (2005) On the run-escaped farmed fish in Norwegian waters, , WWF-Norway; Genner, M.J., Simms, D.W., Waermouth, V.J., Southall, E.J., Southward, A.J., Henderson, P.A., Hawkins, S.J., Regional climatic warming drives long-term community changes of British marine fish (2004) Proc R Soc Lond B, 271, pp. 655-661; Gosler, A.G., Greenwood, J.J.D., Perrins, C.M., Predation risk and the cost of being fat (1995) Nature, 377, pp. 621-623; Grant, P.R., Grant, B.R., Predicting microevolutionary responses to directional selection on heritable variation (1995) Evolution, 49, pp. 241-251; Hansen, L.P., Fiske, P., Holm, M., Jensen, A.J., Sægrov, H., (2005) Population status for salmon in Norway 2004 (in Norwegian), , Report from a working group.
