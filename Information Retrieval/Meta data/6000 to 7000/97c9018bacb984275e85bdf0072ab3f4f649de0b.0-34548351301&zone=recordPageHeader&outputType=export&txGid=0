However, there has not been a reliable method for estimating aerosol properties over land directly from multispectral remotely sensed imagery. In a recent study, a new algorithm to estimate aerosol optical depths (AODs) from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery suitable for all land surfaces was proposed. It is based on a sequence of imagery over a period of time with the assumption that the surface property is relatively stable and atmospheric conditions vary much more dramatically. Although this algorithm was validated over several sites, more validation was necessary. In this study, this algorithm was validated using 3-month measurements at 25 AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) sites in North America. The validation results show that this algorithm can estimate AODs with close agreement with the AERONET measurements [R2=0.69, root mean square error (RMSE) 0.06].",,"Algorithms; Climate change; Hydrology; Multispectral scanners; Remote sensing; Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS); Satellite sensor imagery; Atmospheric aerosols; aerosol property; algorithm; estimation method; image analysis; measurement method; MODIS; optical depth; satellite imagery; spectral analysis",,,,,,"Hsu, N.C., Tsay, S.C., King, M.D., Herman, J.R., Aerosol properties over bright-reflecting source regions (2004) IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 42, pp. 557-569; (2001) Climate Change 2001: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, , IPCC Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Kaufman, Y.J., Karnieli, A., Tanre, D., Detection of dust over deserts using satellite data in the solar wavelengths (2000) IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 38, pp. 525-531; Kaufman, Y.J., Tanré, D., Boucher, O., A satellite view of aerosols in the climate system (2002) Nature, 419, pp. 215-223; Kaufman, Y.J., Tanré, D., Remer, L., Vermote, E.F., Chu, A., Holben, B.N., Operational remote sensing of tropospheric aerosol over the land from EOS-MODIS (1997) Journal of Geophysical Research, 102, pp. 17051-17068; King, M., Kaufman, Y., Tanré, D., Nakajima, T., Remote sensing of tropospheric aerosols from space: Past, present, and future (1999) Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 80, pp. 2229-2259; Liang, S., Zhong, B., Fang, H., Improved estimation of aerosol optical depth from MODIS imagery over land surfaces (2006) Remote Sensing of Environment, 104, pp. 416-425; Remer, L.A., Kaufman, Y.J., Tanré, D., Mattoo, S., Chu, D.A., Martins, J.V., Li, R.-R., Holben, B.N., The MODIS aerosol algorithm, products, and validation (2005) Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences, 62, pp. 947-973; Tang, J., Xue, Y., Yuc, T., Guan, Y.N., Aerosol optical thickness determination by exploiting the synergy of TERRA and AQUA MODIS (2005) Remote Sensing of Environment, 94, pp. 327-334; Walthall, C.L., Norman, J.M., Welles, J.M., Campbell, G., Blad, B.L., Simple equation to approximate the bi-directional reflectance from vegetation canopies and bare soil surfaces (1985) Applied Optics, 24, pp. 383-387","Liang, S.; Department of Geography, University of Maryland, Maryland, MD, United States",,,,,,,,01431161,,IJSED,,"English","Int.
