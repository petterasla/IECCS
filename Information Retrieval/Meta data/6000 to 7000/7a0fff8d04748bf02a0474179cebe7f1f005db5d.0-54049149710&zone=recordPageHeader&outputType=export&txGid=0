The data obtained after an 18-year assessment (1989-2006) of 163 stands, covering an area of ca. 200 × 500 km2 area, were used in this study. In all stands, mast seeding occurred three times (1995, 2000 and 2005) during the study period and the coefficient of annual variation (CV) in seedfall density was 0.94. Based on cluster analysis, the stands were classified into each of the seven groups, in which the seedfall density was temporally synchronized among the stands and showed higher values of CV (1.04-1.79). These groups were distributed spatially exclusively at the scale of 80-200 km. By selecting the tree model based on AIC values, lower temperature in spring, higher temperature in summer and seedfall density in a year were proved to have a decisive influence on the seedfall density in the subsequent year. The effects of the first two climatic cues overwhelm that of the seedfall density. Lower temperature in spring served as a cue mostly for the population in the Oshima Peninsula, while higher temperature in summer served as a cue for the populations in the Tohoku district. If this suggests a genetic variation in relation to cues, climatic changes (e.g., global warming) will have different impacts on seed production of different F. crenata populations. However, it remains to be tested in future studies whether multiple climatic cues simply reflect regionally variable climatic conditions or not. © 2008 The Society of Population Ecology and Springer.","AMeDAS; Global warming; Proximate factor; Temperature anomaly; Tree model","annual variation; cluster analysis; deciduous tree; geographical variation; global warming; masting; population density; seeding; temperate forest; Asia; Eurasia; Far East; Hokkaido; Honshu; Japan; Oshima Peninsula; Tohoku; Fagus; Fagus crenata",,,,,,"Ashton, P., Givnish, T., Appanah, S., Staggered flowering in the Dipterocarpaceae new insights into floral induction and the evolution of mast fruiting in the aseasonal tropics (1988) Am Nat, 132, pp. 44-66. , 10.1086/284837; Crawley, M., (2002) Statistical Computing: An Introduction to Data Analysis Using S-Plus, , Wiley West Sussex; Fujii, N., Tomaru, N., Okuyama, K., Koike, T., Mikami, T., Ueda, K., Chloroplast DNA phylogeography of Fagus crenata (Fagaceae) in Japan (2002) Plant Syst Evol, 232, pp. 21-33. , 10.1007/s006060200024; Hoshizaki, K., Hulme, P., Levey, D., Silva, W., Galleti, M., Mast seeding and predator-mediated indirect interactions in a forest community: Evidence from post-dispersal fate of rodent-generated caches (2002) Seed Dispersal and Frugivory: Ecology, Evolution and Conservation, pp. 227-239. , CABI Publishing Wallingford; Hoshizaki, K., Miguchi, H., Forget, P.M., Lambert, J., Hulme, P., Vander Wall, S., Influence of forest composition on tree seed predation and rodent responses: A comparison of monodominant and mixed temperate forests in Japan (2005) Seed Fate: Predation, Dispersal and Seedling Establishment, pp. 253-267. , CABI Publishing Wallingford; Igarashi, Y., Kamata, N., Insect predation and seasonal seedfall of the Japanese beech, Fagus crenata Blume, in northern Japan (1997) J Appl Entomol, 121, pp. 65-69; Isagi, Y., Sugimura, K., Sumida, A., Ito, H., How does masting happen and synchronize?
