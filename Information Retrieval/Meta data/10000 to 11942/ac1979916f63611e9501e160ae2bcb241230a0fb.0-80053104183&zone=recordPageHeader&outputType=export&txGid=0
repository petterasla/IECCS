This provides an experimental system for determining constraints affecting introduced species in novel environments. Parasite development post-infection was followed at 15, 20 and 25 °C for 15 weeks and at 10 °C for ≥1 year and correlated with temperatures recorded in Wales. Development was slowed/arrested at ≤10 °C which reflects habitat conditions for >6 months/year. There was wide variation in growth at constant temperature (body size differing by >10 times) potentially attributable in part to genotype-specific host-parasite interactions. Parasite density had no effect on size but host sex did: worms in males were 1·8 times larger than in females. Minimum time to patency was 51 days at 25 °C and 73 days at 20 °C although some infections were still not patent at both temperatures by 105 days p.i. In Wales, fastest developing infections may mature within one summer (about 12 weeks), possibly accelerated by movements of hosts into warmer surface waters. Otherwise, development slows/stops in October-April, delaying patency to about 1 year p.i., while wide variation in developmental rates may impose delays of 2 years in some primary infections and even longer in secondary infections. © 2011 Cambridge University Press.","alien species introductions; development; global warming; Monogenea; Protopolystoma; temperature; Xenopus","article; body size; female; habitat; habitat quality; host; host parasite interaction; introduced species; male; nonhuman; parasite; parasite development; parasite survival; parasitosis; priority journal; Protopolystoma xenopodis; sex difference; summer; temperature; United Kingdom; Xenopus laevis; Animals; Body Size; Cell Survival; Environment; Female; Global Warming; Host-Parasite Interactions; Introduced Species; Life Cycle Stages; Male; Ovum; Platyhelminths; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Seasons; Sex Factors; South Africa; Temperature; Time Factors; Trematode Infections; Wales; Xenopus laevis; Monogenea; Protopolystoma; Protopolystoma xenopodis; Xenopus laevis",,,,,,"Barber, I., Parasites grow larger in faster growing fish hosts (2005) International Journal for Parasitology, 35 (2), pp. 137-143. , DOI 10.1016/j.ijpara.2004.11.010; Barré, N., Uilenberg, G., Spread of parasites transported with their hosts: Case study of two species of cattle tick (2010) Revue Scientifique et Technique, Office International des Épizooties, 29, pp. 149-160; Brooks, D.R., Hoberg, E.P., How will global climate change affect parasite-host assemblages?
