The 10 m winds from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3 multi-model ensemble are assessed against reanalysis winds and found to exhibit lowest skill over land areas. Maps of future change in mean wind speed, direction and 99th percentile wind speed are presented to convey spatial information as well as the multi-model agreement on sign and magnitude of the change. The utility of these maps in providing context for the design of more detailed impact studies, for which wind is a required input, is discussed. © 2011 Royal Meteorological Society.","10 m wind; Extreme wind; Global warming; Wind direction change; Wind speed change","anthropogenic effect; climate change; climate modeling; extreme event; global climate; global warming; wind direction; wind velocity",,,,,,"Andrade, C., Pires, H.O., Taborda, R., Freitas, M.C., Projecting future changes in wave climate and coastal response in Portugal by the end of the 21st Century (2007) Journal of Coastal Research, 50, pp. 263-257; Caires, S., Sterl, A., 100-year return value estimates for ocean wind speed and significant wave height from the ERA-40 data (2005) Journal of Climate, 18, pp. 1032-1048; Collins, M., An, S.-I., Cai, W., Ganachaud, A., Guilyardi, E., Jin, F.-F., Jochum, M., Wittenberg, A., The impact of global warming on the tropical Pacific Ocean and El Nino (2010) Nature Geoscience, 3, pp. 391-397; Debernard, J.B., Roed, L.P., Future wind, wave and storm surge climate in the Northern Seas: a revisit (2008) Tellus Series A-Dynamic Meteorology and Oceanography, 60 (3), pp. 427-438; Gastineau, G., Soden, B.J., Model projected changes of extreme wind events in response to global warming (2009) Geophysical Research Letters, 36, pp. L10810-L10810; Solomon, S., Qin, D., Manning, M., Chen, Z., Marquis, M., Avery, K.B., Tignor, M., Miller, H.L., (2007), IPCC Summary for Policymakers.
