Global climate change, widely accepted to be happening, is anticipated to have enormous consequences on future hydrologic patterns. Studies on the potential changes in global, regional, and local hydrologic patterns under global climate change scenarios have been an intense area of research in recent years. The present study contributes to this research topic through evaluation of design flood under climate change. The study utilizes a weather state-based, stochastic multivariate model as a conditional probability model for simulating the precipitation field. An important premise of this study is that large-scale climatic patterns serve as a major driver of persistent year-to-year changes in precipitation probabilities. Since uncertainty estimation in the study of climate change is needed to examine the reliability of the outcomes, this study also applies a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme to the widely used SAC-SMA (Sacramento soil moisture accounting) precipitation-runoff model. A case study is also performed with the Soyang Dam watershed in South Korea as the study basin. Finally, a comprehensive discussion on design flood under climate change is made. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Bayesian precipitation-runoff model; Climate change; Design flood; Downscaling","Bayesian markov chain monte carlo; Conditional probabilities; Design flood; Down-scaling; Ecosystem management; Flood prevention; Global climate changes; Hydrologic cycles; Key elements; Potential change; Precipitation and runoff; Research topics; River restoration; Runoff model; South Korea; State-based; Stochastic multivariate models; Uncertainty estimation; Bayesian networks; Climate models; Design; Flood control; Geologic models; Markov processes; Probability; Research; Runoff; Soil moisture; Stochastic models; Water supply; Climate change; Bayesian analysis; climate change; computer simulation; downscaling; flood frequency; hydrological cycle; Monte Carlo analysis; multivariate analysis; probability; rainfall-runoff modeling; watershed; South Korea",,,,,,"Block, P.J., Souza Filho, F.A., Sun, L., Kwon, H.H., A streamflow forecasting framework using multiple climate and hydrological models (2010) J Am Water Resour Assoc, 45 (4), pp. 828-843; Burnash, R.J.C., The NWS river forecast system-catchment modeling (1995) Computer Models of Watershed Hydrology, , V.
