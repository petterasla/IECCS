Regions characterized by the different changing properties of precipitation concentration index (CI) are identified. The southwest and northeast parts of the Pearl River basin are characterized by lower and decreasing precipitation CI; the northwest and south parts of the study river basin show higher and increasing precipitation CI. Higher but decreasing precipitations CI are found in the West and East River basin. Comparison of precipitation CI trends before and after 1990 shows that most parts of the Pearl River basin are characterized by increasing precipitation CI after 1990. Decreasing precipitation CI after 1990 (compared to precipitation CI changes before 1990) is observed only in a few stations located in the lower Gui River and the lower Yu River. Significant increasing precipitation CI after 1990 is detected in the West River, lower North River and upper Beipan River. These changes of precipitation CI in the Pearl River basin are likely to be associated with the consequences of the well-evidenced global warming. These findings can contribute to basin-scale water resource management and conservation of ecological environment in the Pearl River basin. © Springer-Verlag 2008.","Climate trend; Concentration index (CI); Pearl River; Precipitation variability; Spatial distribution","Climate trend; Concentration index (CI); Pearl River; Precipitation variability; Spatial distribution; Fruits; Gems; Global warming; Management; Natural resources management; Precipitation (meteorology); Rain; Resource allocation; Size distribution; Water conservation; Water management; Water resources; Watersheds; Rivers; global warming; precipitation assessment; precipitation intensity; raingauge; river basin; spatial distribution; spatial variation; trend analysis; water management; water resource; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Guangdong; Zhujiang; Citrus maxima; Viscum album",,,,,,"Alexandersson, H., A homogeneity test applied to precipitation data (1986) J Climatol, 6, pp. 661-675; Becker, S., Gemmer, M., Jiang, T., Spatiotemporal analysis of precipitation trends in the Yangtze River catchment (2006), Stochastic Environmental Research and Risk Assessment (SERRA). doi: 10.1007/s00477-006-0036-7Brooks, C.E.P., Carruthers, N., (1953) Handbooks of Statistical Methods in Meteorology, , Meteorological Office, London; Buishand, T.A., Some methods for testing the homogeneity of rainfall records (1982) J Hydrol, 58, pp. 11-27; Domroes, M., Peng, G., (1988) The Climate of China, p. 361. , Springer, Heidelberg; Dong, D.H., Mitigation to the floods/droughts from the viewpoints of extreme precipitation in the Pearl River (2006) Pearl River, 5, pp. 33-34. , (in Chinese); Gemmer, M., Becker, S., Jiang, T., Observed monthly precipitation trends in China 1951-2002 (2004) Theor Appl Climatol, 77 (1-2), pp. 39-45; Gong, D.Y., Ho, C.H., Shift in the summer rainfall over the Yangtze River valley in the late 1970s (2002) Geophys Res Lett, 29, p. 1436. , doi: 10.1029/2001GL014523; Karl, T.R., Knight, R.W., Easterling, D.R., Quayle, R.G., Indices of climate change (1996) US Bull Am Meteorol Soc, 77 (2), pp. 279-292; Kendall, M.G., (1975) Rank Correlation Methods, , Griffin, London; Mann, H.B., Nonparametric tests against trend (1945) Econometrica, 13, pp. 245-259; Martin-vide, J., Spatial distribution of a daily precipitation concentration index in Peninsular Spain (2004) Int J Climatol, 24, pp. 959-971; Mitchell, J.M., Dzerdzeevskii, B., Flohn, H., Hofmeyr, W.L., Lamb, H.H., Rao, K.N., Wallén, C.C., (1966) Climate Change, p. 79. , WMO Technical Note No. 79.
