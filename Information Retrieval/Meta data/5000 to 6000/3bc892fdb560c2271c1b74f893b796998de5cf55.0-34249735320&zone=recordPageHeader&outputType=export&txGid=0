A major difficulty is that Norway's present energy supply has a low carbon intensity because a substantial part derives from hydropower, but increasing demand may be met by gas-fired electricity generation, thereby making efficiency and conservation a much higher priority. A National Action Plan on Climate Research recognizes the need for increased research efforts in several areas, including the impacts on the built environment and the more general impacts on society. Mitigation opportunities for reducing greenhouse gas emissions within the built environment include increased technological efficiencies, reduced energy usage through improved design, mandatory labelling schemes and a switch to climate neutral fuels for heating. However, radically lower energy requirements and lower U-values will be problematic, requiring new technical solutions and construction methods. There is little integration of policy and strategy for adaptation in Norway. The recognition that climate change will further enhance an array of different, harsh microclimates in Norway, which vary according to individual locality, has led to the development of new adaptation approaches and methods. These allow for the projected local climate to inform decisions on an appropriate design response to meet performance-based codes. The development of design guidance for high-performance building envelopes will, in future, take account of projected local climate. However, there is a tension between the need for standardized national building solutions and the need to adapt to local climatic conditions.","Adaptation; Building performance; Building stock; Climate change; Climate policy; Global warming; Mitigation; Norway; Vulnerability","Carbon dioxide; Energy efficiency; Gas emissions; Global warming; Structural design; Adaptation options; Building performance; Building stocks; Climate policy; Buildings",,,,,,"Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA) (2004) Impacts of a Warming Arctic: Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, Cambridge University Press, CambridgeAimås, A.J., (2005) Nye klimadata for bygningsfysisk prosjektering [New climate data for the design of building enclosures], , Master's thesis, Department of Civil and Transport Engineering, Norwegian University of Science and Technology NTNII, Trondheim; Boardman, B., Examining the carbon agenda via the '40% house' scenario (2007) Building Research & Information, 35 (4), pp. XXX-XXX; Crowley, T.J., Causes of climate change over the past 1000 years (2000) Science, 289, pp. 270-277; Eriksen, S., Øyen, C.F., Underthun, A., Lisø, K.R., Kasa, S., Adaptation to climate change: The case of the housing sector in Norway (2005) 6th Open Meeting of the Human Dimensions of Global Environmental Change Research Community, , Paper presented at the, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany; Vulnerability and Adaptation to Climate Change in Europe (2005), European Environment Agency , Technical Report No. 7/2005, European Environment Agency, Copenhagen(2002) Directive 2002/91/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2002 on the Energy Performance of Buildings, , European Parliament and the Council of the European Union , European Communities, Luxembourg; Hasselmann, K., Latif, M., Hooss, G., Asrar, C., Edenhofer, O., Jaeger, C.C., Johannessen, O.M., Wokaun, A., The challenge of long-term climate change (2003) Science, 302, pp. 1923-1925; Ingvaldsen, T., (1994) Byggskadeomfanget i Norge, , Building Defects in Norway, Project Report No. 163, Norwegian Building Research Institute, Oslo; Karl, T.R., Trenberth, K.E., Modern global climate change (2003) Science, 302, pp. 1719-1723; Kvande, T., Lisø, K.R., Regendichter Putz für gemaurte Fassaden (2003) das Mauerwerk, 2, pp. 59-65; Lisø, K.R., Building envelope performance assessments in harsh climates: Methods for geographically dependent design (2006) Doctoral theses 2006:185, Faculty of Engineering Science and Technology, , Department of Civil and Transport Engineering, Norwegian University of Science and Technology NTNU; Lisø, K.R., Integrated approach to risk management of future climate change impacts (2006) Building Research & Information, 34 (1), pp. 1-10; Lisø, K.R., Aandahl, G., Eriksen, S., Alfsen, K.H., Preparing for climate change impacts in Norway's built environment (2003) Building Research & Information, 31 (3-4), pp. 200-209; Lisø, K.R., Kvande, T., Thue, J.V., Learning from experience - an analysis of process induced building defects in Norway (2006) 3rd International Building Physics/Science Conference, , Paper presented at the, Montreal, Canada, 27-31 August; Lowe, R.
