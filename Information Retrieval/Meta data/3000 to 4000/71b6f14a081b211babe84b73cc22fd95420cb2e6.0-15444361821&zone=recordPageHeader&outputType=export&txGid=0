It is found that the total snow-cover area in the 1980s and 1990s is diminished by 3 × 10 6 km 2, and the length of snow-cover season is reduced by 2-3 weeks, as compared with the 1970s. In general, the contribution from earlier snowmelt is greater than that from delayed snow accumulation. In addition, the maximum snow-cover area during January-February has gradually decreased by about 3 × 10 6 km 2 within the two decades. Geographically, the rate of decrease of snow-cover duration is &lt;0.1 week per year (wpy) in the high-latitude regions such as the Siberian Plains and Northwest Territories of Canada and &gt;0.2 wpy in the high-elevation regions such as the Scandinavian Peninsula, Tibetan Plateau and Rocky Mountains. The earlier snowmelt in the high-elevation regions suggests that the snowfall amounts there are decreasing owing to global warming. © International Glaciological Society.",,"climate change; global warming; Northern Hemisphere; sea ice; snow accumulation; snow cover; snowmelt",,,,,,"Armstrong, R.L., Brodzik, M.J., Recent Northern Hemisphere snow extent: A comparison of data derived from visible and microwave satellite sensors (2001) Geophys.
