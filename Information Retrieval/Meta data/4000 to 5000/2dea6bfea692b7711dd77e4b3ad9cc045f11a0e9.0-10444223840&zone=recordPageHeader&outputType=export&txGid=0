Box 88, Manchester M60 1QD, United Kingdom","The production processes on industrial sites require large amounts of heating, cooling and power for their operation. Therefore, the optimal synthesis of utility systems is of central interest to engineers in the process industries. Recently, the problem of the global climate change has brought forward the question of reducing significantly the emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. In this paper, a new approach is presented for cost-effective de-carbonisation of new utility systems in the process industries. This is based on improved models of utility equipment components and an improved model and procedure for optimal synthesis of utility systems. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
