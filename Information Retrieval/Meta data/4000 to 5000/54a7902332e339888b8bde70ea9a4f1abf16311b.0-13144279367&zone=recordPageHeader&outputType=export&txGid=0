Those surviving in cooler ventilated areas and shaded refuges in the chambers had lower starch concentrations and water contents; the shrubby succulents also exhibited diminished chlorophyll concentrations. asterisk inside a circle sign It is concluded that current thermal regimes are likely to be closely proximate to tolerable extremes for many endemic succulents in the region, and that anthropogenic warming could significantly exceed their thermal thresholds. Further investigation is required to elucidate the importance of associated moisture deficits in these warming experiments, a potential consequence of supplementary (fog and dew) precipitation interception by open-top chambers and higher evaporation therein, on plant mortalities. © New Phytologist (2004).","Global warming; Mortality; Photosynthetic pigments; Starches; Succulents; Sugars","global warming; mortality; photosynthesis; starch; sugar; Africa; Aizoaceae; article; chemistry; greenhouse effect; metabolism; pilot study; plant; plant leaf; season; South Africa; temperature; Africa, Southern; Aizoaceae; Greenhouse Effect; Pilot Projects; Plant Leaves; Plants; Seasons; South Africa; Temperature",,,,,,"Breazeale, E.L., McGeorge, W.T., Breazeale, G.F., Moisture absorption by plants from an atmosphere of high humidity (1950) Plant Physiology, 25, pp. 413-419; Buysse, J., Merckx, R., An improved colorimetric method to quantify sugar content of plant tissue (1993) Journal of Experimental Botany, 44, pp. 1627-1629; (1986) Climate Statistics Up to 1984, , Pretoria, South Africa: Weather Bureau 40, Department of Environmental Affairs, Government Printer; Cowling, R.M., Gibbs Russell, G.E., Hoffman, M.T., Hilton-Tajdor, C., Patterns of plant species diversity in southern Africa (1989) Biotic Diversity in Southern Africa.
