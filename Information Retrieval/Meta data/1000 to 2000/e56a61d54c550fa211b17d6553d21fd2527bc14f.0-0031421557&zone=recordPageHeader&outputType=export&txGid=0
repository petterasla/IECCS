Postal 257, Maputo, Mozambique","The Earth is affected by the emission of different gases which are largely generated by human activities. The 'blanket' these gases form around the planet is likely to affect the climate balance. The resulting warmth could cause partial melting of the polar ice-caps, as well as the thermal expansion of the sea water, with the consequence of harmful degrees of sea-level rise. If global warming becomes a reality, with the consequential sea-level rise Africa's numerous islands and all its low-lying coastal areas, which include large areas of Mozambique, would be severely affected. This paper describes how the projected sea-level rise would affect a particular area in Mozambique, which is just one of the many vulnerable areas. The article also focuses on the broader framework for integrated coastal zone management in Mozambique and its enormous challenges, that aims to accommodate not only the current problems the coastal zone is facing, but also those resulting from the projected accelerated sea level rise.",,"Coastal resources; Integrated coastal management (ICM); Polar ice caps; Vulnerability assessments; Coastal zones; Gas emissions; Global warming; Ice; Melting; Sea level; Seawater; Thermal expansion; Air pollution control; climate; climate change; coastal zone management; global warming; integrated coastal zone management; sea level rise; Mozambique",,,,,,"Sayao, O., Integrated coastal area management plan for Xai-Xai, Mozambique (1995) Draft Report of the First Mission and Sectorial Report, , Acqua Engineering Inc; (1995) Politica Pesqueira e Estratégias de Implementaçäo (Fishery Policy and Implementation Strategies), , Internal Report, MAP, Maputo, 23pp; Saket, M., Malusse, R., (1994) Study for the Determination of the Rate of the Mangrove Vegetation in Mozambique, , FAO/PNUD, MOZ/92/031, May, 9pp; (1990) Mozambique, the Present Environmental Situation, , Internal Report, GTA, Maputo, 146pp. plus annexes; (1995) United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, , Booklet, Switzerland, 29pp; Hughes, P., Brundrit, G.B., The vulnerability of Walvis Bay to rising sea levels (1992) Journal of Coastal Research, 8 (4); Leonel, (1996)(1994) Guidance for Vulnerability and Adaptation Assessment (Coastal Resources Sector) Version 1.0., , U.S. Country Studies Management Team (PO-63). 1000 Independence Ave. S.W., Washington, DC 20585; Jaritz, Geologische, mineralogische and chemische untersuchung des terretrischen pleistozans der ponta matirre bei pebane (Mozambique) (1977) Geol.
