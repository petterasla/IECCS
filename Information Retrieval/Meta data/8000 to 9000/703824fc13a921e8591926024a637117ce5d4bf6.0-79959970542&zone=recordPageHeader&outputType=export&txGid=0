They can cause huge economic losses, but they are also considered as important water resources as they strike Taiwan annually and fill the reservoirs around the island. There are many meteorological sensors available for investigating the characteristics of weather and climate systems. Recently, the use of GPS as an alternative meteorological sensor has become popular due to the catastrophic impact of global climate change. GPS provides meteorological parameters mainly from the atmosphere. Precise Point Positioning (PPP) is a proven algorithm that has attracted attention in GPS related studies. This study uses GPS measurements collected at more than fifty reference stations of the e-GPS network in Taiwan. The first data set was collected from June 1st 2008 to June 7th 2008, which corresponds to the middle of the plum rain season in Taiwan. The second data set was collected from September 11th to September 17th 2008 during the landfall of typhoon Sinlaku. The data processing strategy is to process the measurements collected at the reference stations of the e-GPS network using the PPP technique to estimate the zenith tropospheric delay (ZTD) values of the sites; thus, the correlations between the ZTD values and the variation of rainfall during the plum rains and typhoon are analyzed. In addition, several characteristics of the meteorological events are identified using spatial and temporal analyses of the ZTD values estimated with the GPS network PPP technique. © 2009 by the authors; licensee Molecular Diversity Preservation International, Basel, Switzerland.","Meteorological sensor; Precise point positioning (PPP); Zenith tropospheric delay (ZTD)","Global climate changes; Meteorological parameters; Meteorological sensors; Precise point positioning; Processing strategies; Reference stations; Spatial and temporal analysis; Zenith tropospheric delays; Climate change; Data processing; Hurricanes; Internet protocols; Losses; Rain; Sensors; Troposphere; Water resources; Global positioning system",,,,,,"Peng, W.C., Li, Y.H., Chiang, K.W., Yang, M., The Study of Typhoon Path in Taiwan Region using Precise Point Positioning Technique (2008) ION GNSS 2008, pp. 244-252. , Savannah, GA; Parkinson, B.W., Spilker Jr., J.J., Axelrad, P., Enge, P., (1996) Global Positioning System: Theory & Applications, 2. , Volume Set (Progress in Astronautics and Aeronautics); American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics: Washington, DC, USA; Bevis, M., Businger, S., Herring, T.A., Rocken, C., Anthes, R.A., Ware, R.H., GPS meteorology: Sensing of atmospheric water vapor using the Global Positioning System (1992) J.
