We documented survival rates and adaptations facilitating persistence of native woody species following 2002-2003 wildfires in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Hawaii. Fires occurred during an El Niño drought and were ignited by lava flows. They burned across an environmental gradient occupied by two drier shrub-dominated communities and three mesic/wet Metrosideros forest communities. All the 19 native tree, shrub, and tree fern species demonstrated some capacity of postfire persistence. While greater than 95% of the dominant Metrosideros trees were top-killed, more than half survived fires via basal sprouting. Metrosideros trees with diameters >20 cm sprouted in lower percentages than smaller trees. At least 17 of 29 native woody species colonized the postfire environment via seedling establishment. Although the native biota possess adaptations facilitating persistence following wildfire, the presence of highly competitive invasive plants and ungulates will likely alter postfire succession. © 2009 Springer Netherlands.","Disturbance; Dodonaea viscosa; Fire adaptations; Hawaii; Metrosideros polymorpha; Sprouting",,,,,,,"Agee, J., (1993) Fire Ecology of Pacific Northwest Forests, , Island Press, Washington, DC; Ainsworth, A., (2007) Interactive Influences of Wildfire and Nonnative Species on Plant Community Succession in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, , Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR; Burney, D., De Candido, R., Burney, L., A holocene record of climate change, fire ecology and human activity from montane Flat Top Bog, Maui (1995) J Paleolimnol, 13, pp. 209-217. , doi:10.1007/BF00682765; Burton, P., Mueller-Dombois, D., Response of Metrosideros polymorpha seedlings to experimental canopy opening (1984) Ecology, 65, pp. 779-791. , doi:10.2307/1938050; D'Antonio, C., Vitousek, P., Biological invasions by exotic grasses, the grass/fire cycle, and global change (1992) Annu Rev Ecol Syst, 23, pp. 63-87; D'Antonio, C., Hughes, F., Vitousek, P., Factors influencing dynamics of two invasive C4 grasses in seasonally dry Hawaiian woodland (2001) Ecology, 82, pp. 89-104; D'Antonio, C., Tunison, J., Loh, R., Variation in the impact of exotic grasses on native plant composition in relation to fire across an elevation gradient in Hawaii (2000) Austral Ecol, 25, pp. 507-522; Drake, D., Seed dispersal of Metrosideros polymorpha (Myrtaceae): A pioneer tree of Hawaiian lava flows (1992) Am J Bot, 79, pp. 1224-1228. , doi:10.2307/2445048; Drake, D., Mueller-Dombois, D., Population development of rain forest trees on a chronosequence of Hawaiian lava flows (1993) Ecology, 74, pp. 1012-1019. , doi:10.2307/1940471; Freifelder, R., Vitousek, P., D'Antonio, C., Microclimate change and effect on fire following forest-grass conversion in seasonally dry tropical woodland (1998) Biotropica, 30, pp. 286-297. , doi:10.1111/j.1744-7429.1998.tb00062.x; Gassaway, L., Tunison, J., Loh, R., (2002) Kupukupu Fire Hawaii Volcanoes National Park: Burned Area Emergency Rehabilitation Plan, , Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Hawaii; Griffin, J., Sprouting in fire-damaged valley oaks, Chews Ridge, California (1980) Ecology, Management, and Utilization of California Oaks, pp. 216-219. , General Technical Report PSW-44.
