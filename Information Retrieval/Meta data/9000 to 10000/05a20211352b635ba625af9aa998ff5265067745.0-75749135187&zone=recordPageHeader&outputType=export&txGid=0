Ongoing global warming will increase the recurrence of FTC in cool-temperate and high-latitude regions. Here, we report on the above- and belowground biomass production as well as the nitrogen nutrition of two common vegetation types, grassland and heath, after more frequent FTC in a controlled field experiment in Central Europe. Furthermore, we analyze the duration of the observed effects. Five FTC were induced by buried heating wires in addition to three naturally occurring FTC during winter 2005/06. More frequent FTC significantly increased aboveground production of experimental grassland early in the following growing season. However, no reaction was found for experimental heath within the first growing season. Biomass production of heath communities dropped significantly and C/N ratio increased in the freeze-thaw treated plots in the second year after the manipulation, whereas production in the grassland communities was no longer affected significantly, except for an increase in C/N ratio. This response can at least partly be explained by changes in nutrient availability, as plant available nitrate increased in the manipulated grassland plots and decreased in the manipulated heath plots. The results show the high ecological importance of climate changes during winter, with the outcomes differing strongly between contrasting vegetation types. Furthermore, we show that short term climatic events can cause long-lasting effects, sometimes emerging in the vegetation only after considerable time lags (here: one growing season). © 2009 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.","Ecological memory; EVENT-experiment; Freezing-thawing; Frost; Grassland; Heath; Winter climate change",,,,,,,"Andresen, L.C., Michelsen, A., Off-season uptake of nitrogen in temperate heath vegetation (2005) Oecologia, 144, pp. 585-597; Baayen, R.H., Davidson, D.J., Bates, D.M., Mixed-effects modeling with crossed random effects for subjects and items (2008) Journal of Memory and Language, 59, pp. 390-412; Campbell, J.L., Mitchell, M.J., Groffman, P.M., Christenson, L.M., Hardy, J.P., Winter in northeastern North America: A critical period for ecological processes (2005) Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, 3, pp. 314-322; Grogan, P., Michelsen, A., Ambus, P., Jonasson, S., Freeze-thaw regime effects on carbon and nitrogen dynamics in sub-arctic heath tundra mesocosms (2004) Soil Biology and Biochemistry, 36, pp. 641-654; Harris, M.M., Safford, L.O., Effects of season and four tree species on soluble carbon content in fresh and decomposing litter of temperate forests (1996) Soil Science, 161, pp. 130-135; Henry, H.A.L., Soil freeze-thaw cycle experiments: Trends, methodological weaknesses and suggested improvements (2007) Soil Biology and Biochemistry, 39, pp. 977-986; Henry, H.A.L., Climate change and soil freezing dynamics: historical trends and projected changes (2008) Climatic Change, 87, pp. 421-434; Herrmann, A., Witter, E., Sources of C and N contributing to the flush in mineralization upon freeze-thaw cycles in soils (2002) Soil Biology and Biochemistry, 34, pp. 1495-1505; Jentsch, A., Kreyling, J., Beierkuhnlein, C., A new generation of climate change experiments: Events, not trends (2007) Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, 5, pp. 365-374; Jentsch, A., Kreyling, J., Böttcher-Treschkow, J., Beierkuhnlein, C., Beyond gradual warming: Extreme weather events alter flower phenology of European grassland and heath species (2008) Global Change Biology, 14, pp. 1-13; Joseph, G., Henry, H.A.L., Soil nitrogen leaching losses in response to freeze-thaw cycles and pulsed warming in a temperate old field (2008) Soil Biology and Biochemistry, 40, pp. 1947-1953; Jylha, K., Fronzek, S., Tuomenvirta, H., Carter, T.R., Ruosteenoja, K., Changes in frost, snow and Baltic sea ice by the end of the twenty-first century based on climate model projections for Europe (2008) Climatic Change, 86, pp. 441-462; Kreyling, J., Beierkuhnlein, C., Elmer, M., Pritsch, K., Radovski, M., Schloter, M., Soil biotic processes remain remarkably stable after 100-year extreme weather events in experimental grassland and heath (2008) Plant and Soil, 308, pp. 175-188; Kreyling, J., Beierkuhnlein, C., Pritsch, K., Schloter, M., Jentsch, A., Recurrent soil freeze-thaw cycles enhance grassland productivity (2008) New Phytologist, 177, pp. 938-945; Larsen, K.S., Grogan, P., Jonasson, S., Michelsen, A., Respiration and microbial dynamics in two subarctic ecosystems during winter and spring thaw: Effects of increased snow cover (2007) Arctic Antarctic and Alpine Research, 39, pp. 268-276; Matzner, E., Borken, W., Do freeze-thaw events enhance C and N losses from soils of different ecosystems?
