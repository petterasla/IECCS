Anthropogenic modification of chemical and physical atmospheric dynamics that cause coral death by bleaching and newly emergent diseases due to increased heat and irradiation, as well as decline in calcification caused by ocean acidification due to increased CO 2, are the most important large-scale threats. On more local scales, overfishing and destructive fisheries, coastal construction, nutrient enrichment, increased runoff and sedimentation, and the introduction of nonindigenous invasive species have caused phase shifts away from corals. Already ∼20% of the world's reefs are lost and ∼26% are under imminent threat. Conservation science of coral reefs is well advanced, but its practical application has often been lagging. Societal priorites, economic pressures, and legaladministrative systems of many countries are more prone to destroy rather than conserve coral-reef ecosystems. Nevertheless, many examples of successful conservation exist from the national level to community-enforced local action. When effectively managed, protected areas have contributed to regeneration of coral reefs and stocks of associated marine resources. Local communities often support coral-reef conservation in order to raise income potential associated with tourism andor improved resource levels. Coral reefs create an annual income in S-Florida alone of over $4 billion. Thus, no conflict between development, societal welfare, and coral-reef conservation needs to exist. Despite growing threats, it is not too late for decisive action to protect and save these economically and ecologically high-value ecosystems. Conservation science plays a critical role in designing effective strategies. © 2009 New York Academy of Sciences.","Bleaching; Conservation; Coral diseases; Coral reef; Global climate change; Marine reserve; Ocean acidification; Overfishering; Phase shift; Tourism","carbon dioxide; runoff; sea water; acidification; biodiversity; bleaching; climate change; coastal waters; coral; coral reef; ecosystem; environmental protection; fishery; fishing; global change; greenhouse effect; heat; irradiation; nonhuman; nutrient; review; sea; sedimentation; species invasion; threat; tourism; United States; animal; Anthozoa; biology; ecosystem; food industry; Anthozoa; Animals; Anthozoa; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Fisheries; Marine Biology; Seawater",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4",,,,"Alcala, A., Collaborative and community-based conservation of coral reefs, with reference to marine reserves in the Philippines (2006) Coral Reef Conservation, pp. 392-418. , I.M.
