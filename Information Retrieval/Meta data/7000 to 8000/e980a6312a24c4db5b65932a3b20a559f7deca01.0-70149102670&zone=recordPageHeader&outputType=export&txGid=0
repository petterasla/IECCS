Ciliates were collected from the bed surface of a small springbrook and from interstitial water collected at five depths beneath its surface. Mean temperature elevations established at each depth (-20, -40, -60, -80, and -100cm) between the experiment's control and treatment blocks were 1.9, 3.5, 3.9, 3.8, and 3.6°C, respectively, and were based on global warming projections for the region. In total, 160 species of ciliate belonging to 85 genera were identified. Overall, the treatment block had a higher density (6510 ± 342 cells L-1; ± 1SE) than the control (5797 ± 237 cells L-1), but densities were both vertically and longitudinally variable. Control densities decreased with depth, whereas treatment densities were more equal among depths. Total species richness showed no significant difference between blocks when combining all sampling dates and depths, although species composition changed. The ciliate community was dominated by small (15-50μm), followed by medium (50-200μm), and only a few large-sized (&gt;200μm) species. Small ciliates contributed 82-97% of the total density. Small ciliates also contributed more to the treatment (94%) than the control block (88%). The most common ciliate feeding groups were bacterivores, omnivores, predators, and algae-diatom feeders, with bacterivores being most dominant (83-99% of the total numbers collected). Ordination analyses revealed that ciliate distribution was strongly correlated with groundwater temperature, although dissolved oxygen level, concentrations of ammonia and nitrate, and depth also appeared to be influential. Peak densities of many species occurred in either the control or treatment blocks, but not in both. The benefits of using ciliates as a proxy for higher, much longer-lived, eukaryotes in climate change studies are discussed. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Canada; Canonical correspondence analysis; Ciliates; Ecosystem manipulation; global warming; Shallow groundwater; Temperature","canonical analysis; ciliate; climate change; correspondence analysis; global warming; species richness; Canada; North America; Ontario [Canada]; algae; Bacillariophyta; Ciliophora; Eukaryota; Protista",,,,,,"Andrushchyshyn, O.P., Magnusson, A.K., Williams, D.D., Responses of intermittent pond and ciliate populations and communities to in situ bottom-up and top down manipulations (2006) Aquatic Microbial Ecology, 42, pp. 293-310; Andrushchyshyn, O.P., Wilson, K.P., Williams, D.D., Ciliate communities in shallow groundwater: Seasonal and spatial characteristics (2007) Freshwater Biology, 52, pp. 1745-1761; Atkinson, D., Ciotti, B.J., Montagnes, D.J.S., Protists decrease in size linearly with temperature: Ca. 2.5%°C-1 (2003) Proceedings of the Royal Society London B, 270, pp. 2605-2611; Barbanera, F., Erra, F., Ricci, N., The effect of heating on the behaviour of Oxytricha bifaria (Ciliophora, Hypotrichida) (2000) Canadian Journal of Zoology - Revue Canadienne De Zoologie, 78, pp. 484-494; Benjamini, Y., Hochberg, Y., Controlling the false discovery rate - A practical and powerful approach to multiple testing (1995) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society B, 57, pp. 289-300; Bick, H., (1972) Ciliated Protozoa - An Illustrated Guide to the Species Used As Biological Indicators in Freshwater Biology, , World Health Organization, Geneva; Carpenter, S.R., Chisholm, S.A., Krebs, C.J., Schindler, D.W., Wright, R.F., Ecosystem experiments (1995) Science, 269, pp. 324-327; Cleven, E.J., Seasonal and spatial distribution of ciliates in the sandy hyporheic zone of a lowland stream (2004) European Journal of Protistology, 40, pp. 71-84; Corliss, J.O., (1979) The Ciliated Protozoa -Characterization, Classification and Guide to the Literature, , Pergamon Press, Oxford; Curds, C.R., Gates, M.A., Roberts, D.M., (1982) British and Other Freshwater Ciliated Protozoa.
