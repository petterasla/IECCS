Carbon dioxide (CO 2) from the combustion of fossil fuel is a major greenhouse gas, and automobile exhaust is one of its contributors. The only way to decrease CO 2 emissions from a car consuming carbonaceous fuel is to decrease its fuel consumption. The best alternative fossil fuels offer a CO 2 reduction of about 20%. Without introducing any new greenhouse-gas controls, it is projected that the total greenhouse-gas contribution of the average car will be halved from recent levels just through fleet turnover and already planned elimination of the current air-conditioning refrigerant. If global warming develops into a serious problem, cars can be operated without fossil fuel. Leading options include battery-electric cars using nuclear power and engine-propelled cars burning biomass-derived alcohol or hydrogen extracted from water with solar cells or nuclear power.",,"Carbon dioxide; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse effect; Hydrogen; Automobile exhaust; Biomass fuel; Carbon dioxide emissions; Fleet turnover; Hydrogen fuel; Automotive fuels",,,,,,,"Amann, C.A.; General Motors Research LabUnited States",,,,,,,,01433369,,IJVDD,,"English","Int J Veh Des",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026992307
