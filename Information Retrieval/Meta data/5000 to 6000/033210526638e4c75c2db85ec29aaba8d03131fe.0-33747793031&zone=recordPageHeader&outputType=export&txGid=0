However, paradoxically, climatic warming can lead to microclimatic cooling in spring by advancing plant growth, an effect worsened by excess nitrogen. We suggest that spring-developing but thermophilous organisms, such as butterflies hibernating as egg or larva, are particularly sensitive to the cooling of microclimates. Using published data on butterfly trends in distribution, we report a comparatively greater decline in egg-larva hibernators in European countries with oceanic climates and high nitrogen deposition, which supports this explanation. Furthermore, trends in abundance from a nationwide butterfly monitoring scheme reveal a 63% decrease over 13 years (1992-2004) for egg-larva hibernators in the Netherlands, contrasting with a nonsignificant trend in adult-pupa hibernators. This evidence supports the hypothesis that these environmental changes pose new threats to spring-developing, thermophilous species. We underline the threat of climate change to biodiversity, as previously suggested on the basis of mobility, habitat fragmentation and evolutionary adaptation, but we here emphasize a different ecological axis of change in habitat quality. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Biodiversity; Butterflies; Climate change; Habitat quality; Microclimate; Nitrogen deposition","biodiversity; butterfly; climate change; deposition; global warming; habitat quality; microclimate; nitrogen; Insecta; Papilionoidea",,,,,,"Achermann, B., Bobbink, R., (2003) Empirical Critical Loads for Nitrogen: Proceedings Expert Workshop, , (eds) 11-13 November 2002, Env.
