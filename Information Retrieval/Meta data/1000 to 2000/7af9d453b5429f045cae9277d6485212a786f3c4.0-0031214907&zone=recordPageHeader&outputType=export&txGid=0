We are focusing pilot studies on design questions, on scaling issues and regionalization, ecosystem structure and function, indicator selection and evaluation, and monitoring technologies. Rock Creek, a headwater stream near Denali headquarters, is the ecological scale for initial testing of a watershed ecosystem approach. Our conceptual model embraces principles of the hydrological cycle, hypotheses of global climate change, and biological interactions of organisms occupying intermediate, but poorly studied, positions in Alaskan food webs. The field approach includes hydrological and depositional considerations and a suite of integrated measures linking key aquatic and terrestrial biota, environmental variables, or defined ecological processes, in order to establish ecological conditions and detect, track, and understand mechanisms of environmental change. Our sampling activities include corresponding measures of physical, chemical, and biological attributes in four Rock Creek habitats believed characteristic of the greater system diversity of Denali. This paper gives examples of data sets, program integration and scaling, and research needs.","Alaska; Denali National Park; Environmental change; Monitoring; Protocol; Watershed ecosystem; Watershed management/wildland hydrology","Aquatic biota; Wildland hydrology; Climate change; Ecology; Hydrology; Marine biology; Parks; Sampling; Watersheds; Ecosystems; climate change; ecosystem monitoring; hydrological cycle; watershed; USA, Alaska, Denali National Park, Rock Creek; cellular organisms",,,,,,"Allen, T.F.H., Hoekstra, T.W., The Confusion between Scale-Defined Levels and Conventional Levels of Organization in Ecology (1990) Journal of Vegetation Science, 1, pp. 5-12; (1985) Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater (16th Edition), , American Public Health Association, Washington, D.C; Baron, J., Biogeochemistry of a Subalpine Ecosystem, Loch Vale Watershed (1992) Ecological Studies, 90, 247p. , Springer-Verlag, New York, New York; Bonham, C., (1989) Measurements for Terrestrial Vegetation, , John Wiley & Sons, New York, New York; Carpenter, S.R., Chisholm, S.W., Krebs, C.J., Schindler, D.W., Wright, R.F., Ecosystem Experiments (1995) Science, 269, pp. 324-327; Carter, R.W., Davidian, J., General Procedure for Gaging Streams (1968) Techniques of Water-Resources Investigations of the United States Geological Survey, 13p. , Book 3, Chapter A6.
