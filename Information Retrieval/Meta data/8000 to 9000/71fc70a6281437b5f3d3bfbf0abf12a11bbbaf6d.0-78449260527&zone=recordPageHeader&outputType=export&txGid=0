Hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) concentrations were analyzed in all of the samples. The average concentrations (±standard deviation) over the entire period were 33 ± 16, 5.4 ± 3.0, and 13 ± 7.5 pg m-3 for α-, β- and γ-HCH, respectively. Compared to previous studies in the same areas, total HCH (ΣHCH, the sum of α-, β-, and γ-HCH) levels declined by more than 10× compared to those observed in the 1990s, but were approximately 4× higher than those measured by the 2003 China Arctic Research Expedition, suggesting the increase of atmospheric ΣHCH recently. Because of the continuing use of lindane, ratios of α/γ-HCH showed an obvious decrease in North Pacific and Arctic region compared with those for 2003 Chinese Arctic Research Expedition. In Arctic, the level of α-HCH was found to be linked to sea ice distribution. Geographically, the average concentration of α-HCH in air samples from the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas, neither of which contain sea ice, was 23 ± 4.4 pg m-3, while samples from the area covered by seasonal ice (∼75°N to ∼83°N), the so-called ""floating sea ice region"", contained the highest average levels of α-HCH at 48 ± 12 pg m-3, likely due to emission from sea ice and strong air-sea exchange. The lowest concentrations of α-HCH were observed in the pack ice region in the high Arctic covered by multiyear sea ice (∼83°N to ∼86°N). This phenomenon implies that the re-emission of HCH trapped in ice sheets and Arctic Ocean may accelerate during the summer as ice coverage in the Arctic Ocean decreases in response to global climate change. © 2010 American Chemical Society.",,"Air samples; Air-sea exchange; Arctic ocean; Arctic regions; Arctic research; Average concentration; Beaufort sea; Global climate changes; Hexachlorocyclohexanes; High arctic; Human activities; Ice sheet; Marine boundary layers; North Pacific; Pack ice; Re-emission; Research expeditions; Sea ice distribution; Shanghai , China; Standard deviation; Arctic engineering; Atmospheric boundary layer; Concentration (process); Icebreakers; Oceanography; Research; Sea ice; Climate change; hexachlorocyclohexane; ice; lindane; air-sea interaction; boundary layer; climate change; concentration (composition); emission; HCH; human activity; ice cover; marine environment; sea ice; air sampling; air sea exchange; Arctic; article; atmospheric deposition; chemical analysis; China; climate change; concentration (parameters); environmental monitoring; environmental parameters; geography; marine environment; sea; sea ice; Air Pollutants; Arctic Regions; Atmosphere; China; Climate Change; Environmental Monitoring; Lindane; Arctic; China; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); Shanghai",,"hexachlorocyclohexane, 608-73-1; lindane, 58-89-9; Air Pollutants; Lindane, 58-89-9",,,,"Lakaschus, S., Weber, K., Wania, F., Bruhn, R., Schrems, O., The air-sea equilibrium and time trend of hexachlorocyclohexanes in the Atlantic Ocean between the Arctic and Antarctica (2002) Environ.
