After analysis of trends in meteorological parameters, the impacts of climate change on irrigation water requirements were investigated. The results showed that, due to highly remarkable decreased average wind speed and sunshine hours, there was a slightly decreasing trend in the reference crop evapotranspiration (ET); while a decreasing trend was detected in precipitation, which brought about an increasing trend in the irrigation water requirements. Overall, besides the alarming rise in industrial and domestic water requirements, climate change contributed to the lack of sufficient water for agriculture in China during the past decades, which will have significant implications for adaptation strategies for climate change and policies for water management.
