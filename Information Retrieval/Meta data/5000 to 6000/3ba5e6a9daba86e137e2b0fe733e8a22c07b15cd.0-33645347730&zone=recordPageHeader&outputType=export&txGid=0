The findings show that there are both environmental and human health benefits of growing GM maize including lower impacts on global warming, ozone depletion, freshwater ecotoxicity and human toxicity. However, when considered in terms of the use of maize as a feed input to broiler chicken production, the benefits of the GM alternative become negligible compared to the use of conventional maize.","Environmental effects; GM maize; Life-cycle assessment; Poultry","Gallus gallus; Insecta; Zea mays",,,,,,"Audsley, E., Alber, S., Clift, R., (1997) Harmonisation of Environmental Life Cycle Assessment for Agriculture.
