This paper presents a comprehensive and consistent methodology to account for the costs and carbon flows of different categories of forestry projects and describes the application of the methodology to a set of projects in Central America. Several estimates have been made to date of the overall potential for carbon storage through global reforestation and the costs of such efforts, based on global macroeconomic estimates and extrapolations from current forest-sector experience. However, there has yet to be a consistent analysis of the magnitude and cost of carbon savings by a ""bottom-up"" approach to sustainable forestry development. This methodology is applied to a set of projects proposed in Costa Rica and other Central American countries under the Tropical Forest Action Plan, to estimate a sample set of national CO2 reduction cost curves. The costs of carbon savings in the forestry projects studied in Central America mostly fall between $5 and $13 ton-C1, depending on the type of project, the climate, and the opportunity cost of land. These projects also promise socio-economic benefits at the local level, provided they are adequately endowed with funding, training and institutional support. The total amount of CO2 storage potential is significant, about 100 million tons per country, but not enough to suggest that forestry can offset more than a few percent of global CO2 emissions from fossil fuel use. © 1992.","Carbon sequestration; carbon storage equations; Central American forests; emission reduction costs; forest conservation; global warming; reforestation; sustainable forestry","afforestation; carbon dioxide emissions reduction; carbon storage; forest conservation; forestry; Central America; Costa Rica",,,,,,"Schneider, The changing climate (1989) Scientific American, 261 (3), pp. 70-79; Lanly, Assessment of the forest resources of the tropics (1983) For.
