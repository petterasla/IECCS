The surface air temperature exhibits a warming trend during winter, spring, and early summer and a modest countrywide cooling trend in late summer and fall, with the strongest warming occurring over the northern United States in spring. Precipitation trends are positive in all seasons, with the largest trend occurring over the central and southern United States in fall. This study investigates the causes of the seasonality and regionality of those trends, with a focus on the cooling and wetting trends in the central United States during late summer and fall. In particular, the authors examine the link between the seasonality and regionality of the climate trends over the United States and the leading patterns of sea surface temperature (SST) variability, including a global warming (GW) pattern and a Pacific decadal variability (PDV) pattern. A series of idealized atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) experiments were performed forced by SST trends associated with these leading SST patterns, as well as the residual trend pattern (obtained by removing the GW and PDV contributions). The results show that the observed seasonal and spatial variations of the climate trends over the United States are to a large extent explained by changes in SST. Among the leading patterns of SST variability, the PDV pattern plays a prominent role in producing both the seasonality and regionality of the climate trends over the United States. In particular, it is the main contributor to the apparent cooling and wetting trends over the central United States. The residual SST trend, a manifestation of phase changes of the Atlantic multidecadal SST variation during 1950-2000, also exerts influences that show strong seasonality with important contributions to the central U.S. temperature and precipitation during the summer and fall seasons. In contrast, the response over the United States to the GW SST pattern is an overall warming with little seasonality or regional variation. These results highlight the important contributions of decadal and multidecadal variability in the Pacific and Atlantic in explaining the observed seasonality and regionality of the climate trends over the United States during the period of 1950-2000. © 2009 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric general circulation models; Climate trends; Cooling trends; Multidecadal variability; Pacific decadal variabilities; Phase Change; Precipitation trends; Regional variation; Sea surface temperatures; Seasonality; Spatial variations; Surface air temperatures; Cooling; Global warming; Rain; Submarine geophysics; Wetting; Atmospheric temperature; air temperature; atmospheric general circulation model; climate variation; global warming; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; sea surface temperature; seasonal variation; seasonality; spatial variation; North America; United States",,,,,,"Bacmeister, J., Pegion, P.J., Schubert, S.D., Suarez, M.J., (2000) Atlas of seasonal means simulated by the NSIPP 1 Atmospheric GCM.
