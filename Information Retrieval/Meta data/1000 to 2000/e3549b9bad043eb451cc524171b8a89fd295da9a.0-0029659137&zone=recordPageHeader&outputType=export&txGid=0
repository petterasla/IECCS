The potential changes in the climate system could affect hydrological cycles and processes. Possible impacts of climate change on water resources should be assessed to evaluate probable adaptation measures. In the Philippines, a preliminary assessment of the vulnerability of water resources to climate change and variability was undertaken. For this particular study, the Angat Reservoir was chosen as the study area. Because of its socioeconomic importance, it is useful to assess its vulnerability to climate change. A rainfall-runoff simulation model, WATBAL, was used to determine the effect of temperature and rainfall changes, based on CO2 doubling, on inflow to the reservoir. Climate change scenarios developed from results from three general circulation models and incremental changes were used. The results showed that changes in temperature and rainfall could affect runoff either positively or negatively. Using the temperature and rainfall changes from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory model there was a 32% increase in runoff, and with the Canadian Climate Centre Model, there was a 15% decrease in runoff. Under a climate scenario generated by the United Kingdom Meteorological Office model, runoff is estimated to increase by 5%. The use of incremental scenarios revealed the strong sensitivity of runoff to changes in rainfall as compared with changes in temperature.","CCCM; GFDL; Philippines; UKMO; WATBAL; water resources","drinking water; air pollution; climate; conference paper; environmental impact assessment; greenhouse effect; meteorology; model; philippines; climate change; climate variation; GCM; reservoir; runoff; water resources; Philippines, Angat; Atmospheric composition; Atmospheric temperature; Carbon dioxide; Environmental impact; Hydrology; Mathematical models; Rain; Reservoirs (water); Runoff; Angat water reservoir; Climate change vulnerability; WATBAL simulation model; Global warming",,,,,,"(1982) The ASEAN Climatic Atlas, , ASEAN Subcommittee on Climatology, ASEAN Subcommittee on Science and Technology, ASEAN Secretariat, Jakarta, Indonesia; Asuncion, J., Parong, E.M., Mean Streamlines and Isotachs for Selected Pressure Levels for Southeast Asia and Adjacent Areas and an Attempt to Forecast the 500 and 300 Millibar Wind Flow (1980) PAGASA Research Paper, , Quezon City, Philippines; Boer, G.J., McFarlane, N., Lazare, M., (1992) Journal of Climate, 5, p. 1045; In-na, N., Hemantha, E.J., (1991) Simulating the Effects of Global Warming on Evapotranspiration and Rainfall, , Report, Thammas at University, Rangit Campus, Thailand; (1992) Scientific Assessment of Climate Change, , Houghton J.T., Callander B.A., and Vamey S.K.
