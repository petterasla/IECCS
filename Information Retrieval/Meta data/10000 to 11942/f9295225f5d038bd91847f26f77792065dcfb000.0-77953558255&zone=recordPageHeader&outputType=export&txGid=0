The aim of this research was to study the effects of global warming on thermal comfort conditions in indoor ambiences in Iran. To study the increase in temperature, model for assessment of greenhouse-gas induced climate change scenario generator compound model has been used together with four scenarios and to estimate thermal comfort conditions, adaptive model of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-conditioning Engineers has been used. In this study, Iran was divided into 30 zones, outdoor conditions were obtained using meteorological data of 80 climatological stations and changes in neutral comfort conditions in 2025, 2050, 2075 and 2100 were predicted. In accordance with each scenario, findings from this study showed that temperature in the 30 zones will increase by 2100 to between 3.4 °C and 5.6 °C. In the coming decades and in the 30 studied zones, neutral comfort temperature will increase and be higher and more intense in the central and desert zones of Iran. The low increase in this temperature will be connected to the coastal areas of the Caspian and Oman Sea in southeast Iran. This increase in temperature will be followed by a change in thermal comfort and indoor energy consumption from 8.6% to 13.1% in air conditioning systems. As a result, passive methods as thermal inertia are proposed as a possible solution. © IRSEN, CEERS, IAU.","Bioclimatic; Energy; Forecast; General circulation models","air conditioning; bioclimatology; climate change; coastal zone; general circulation model; global warming; greenhouse gas; indoor air; public health; simulation; temperature effect; Arabian Sea; Caspian Sea; Gulf of Oman; Indian Ocean; Iran",,,,,,"Abbaspour, M., Jafari, M.J., Mansouri, N., Moattar, F., Nouri, N., Allahyari, M., Thermal comfort evaluation in Tehran metro using Relative Warmth Index (2008) Int.
