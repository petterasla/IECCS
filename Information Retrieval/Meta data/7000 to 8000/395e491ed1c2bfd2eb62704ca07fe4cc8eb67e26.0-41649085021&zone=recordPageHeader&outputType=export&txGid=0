This temporal pattern has complicated efforts to reconstruct the early dispersal history of primates in relation to global climate change and eustatic fluctuations in sea level. Here, I describe fossils from the Tuscahoma Formation on the Gulf Coastal Plain of Mississippi documenting an anatomically primitive species of Teilhardina that is older than other North American and European primates. Consistent with its antiquity, a phylogenetic analysis of dental characters recognizes Teilhardina magnoliana, sp. nov., as the most basal member of this genus currently known from either North America or Europe. Its stratigraphic provenance demonstrates that primates originally colonized North America near the base of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), but before an important fall in eustatic sea level. Correlation based on carbon isotope stratigraphy and sequence stratigraphy indicates that the earliest North American primates inhabited coastal regions of the continent for thousands of years before they were able to colonize the Rocky Mountain Interior. The transient provincialism displayed by early North American primates corresponds to similar biogeographic patterns noted among fossil plants. Decreased precipitation in the Rocky Mountain Interior during the early part of the PETM may have been an important factor in maintaining biotic provincialism within North America at this time. These results underscore the need to obtain multiple, geographically dispersed records bearing on significant macroevolutionary events such as the PETM. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Dispersal; Omomyidae; Phylogeny; Teilhardina; Wasatchian","carbon; article; biogeography; Eocene; fossil; mammal; nonhuman; North America; Paleocene; paleontology; phylogeny; population dispersion; precipitation; primate; priority journal; stratigraphy; Teilhardina magnoliana; United States; animal; dentition; geography; histology; history; paleontology; primate; Mammalia; Omomyidae; Primates; Teilhardina; Animals; Dentition; Fossils; Geography; History, Ancient; Mississippi; North America; Paleontology; Phylogeny; Primates",,"carbon, 7440-44-0",,,,"Smith, T., Rose, K.D., Gingerich, P.D., Rapid Asia-Europe-North America geographic dispersal of earliest Eocene primate Teilhardina during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (2006) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 103, pp. 11223-11227; Beard, K.C., Dawson, M.R., Intercontinental dispersal of Holarctic land mammals near the Paleocene/Eocene boundary: Paleogeographic, paleoclimatic and biostratigraphic implications (1999) Bull Soc Géol France, 170, pp. 697-706; Gingerich, P.D., New earliest Wasatchian mammalian fauna from the Eocene of northwestern Wyoming: Composition and diversity in a rarely sampled high-floodplain assemblage (1989) Univ Michigan Pap Paleontol, 28, pp. 1-97; Wing, S.L., Harrington, G.J., Smith, F.A., Bloch, J.I., Boyer, D.M., Freeman, K.H., Transient floral change and rapid global warming at the Paleocene-Eocene boundary (2005) Science, 310, pp. 993-996; Kraus, M.J., Riggins, S., Transient drying during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM): Analysis of paleosols in the Bighorn Basin, Wyoming (2007) Palaeogeogr Palaeoclimatol Palaeoecol, 245, pp. 444-461; Sluijs, A., Subtropical Arctic Ocean temperatures during the Palaeocene/Eocene thermal maximum (2006) Nature, 441, pp. 610-613; Bowen, G.J., Mammalian dispersal at the Paleocene/Eocene boundary (2002) Science, 295, pp. 2062-2065; Krause, D.W., Maas, M.C., The biogeographic origins of late Paleocene-early Eocene mammalian immigrants to the Western Interior of North America (1990) Geol Soc Am Spec Pap, 243, pp. 71-105; Gingerich, P.D., Smith, T., Paleocene-Eocene land mammals from three new latest Clarkforkian and earliest Wasatchian wash sites at Polecat Bench in the northern Bighorn Basin, Wyoming (2006) Contrib Mus Paleontol Univ Michigan, 31, pp. 245-303; Yans, J., High-resolution carbon isotope stratigraphy and mammalian faunal change at the Paleocene-Eocene boundary in the Honeycombs area of the southern Bighorn Basin, Wyoming (2006) Am J Sci, 306, pp. 712-735; Ni, X.J., Wang, Y.Q., Hu, Y.M., Li, C.K., A euprimate skull from the early Eocene of China (2004) Nature, 427, pp. 65-68; Holman, J.A., Case, G.R., A puzzling new snake (Reptilia: Serpentes) from the late Paleocene of Mississippi (1992) Ann Carnegie Mus, 61, pp. 197-205; Case GR (1994) Fossil fish remains from the late Paleocene Tuscahoma and early Eocene Bashi formations of Meridian, Lauderdale County, Mississippi.
