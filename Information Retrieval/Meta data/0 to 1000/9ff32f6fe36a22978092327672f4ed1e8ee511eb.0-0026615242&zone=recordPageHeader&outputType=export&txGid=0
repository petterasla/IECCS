To measure ecosystem changes resulting from multiple stresses, such as a combination of pollutants (some local and some not) and physical habitat changes including those that might arise from global warming, it is necessary to measure attributes of whole ecosystems. These include primary productivity, nutrient cycling, species diversity, instability, disease prevalence, size spectrum and contaminant effects across trophic levels. Monitoring programmes should test hypotheses regarding changes in and effects on (a) processes, such as bioaccumulation, biomass production, respiration, reproduction and eutrophication that, if impaired, may lead to changes in ecosystem structure; and (b) the structure and key system attributes of marine ecosystems. © 1992.",,"bioaccumulation; biomass; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; eutrophication; greenhouse effect; marine environment; nutrient; pollutant; pollution; productivity; short survey; disease; ecosystem response; ecosystem structure; environmental impact assessment; environmental quality; global warming; marine ecosystem; nutrient cycling; pollution; primary productivity; species diversity",,,,,,"Adams, Greely, Jr., Shugart, Direct and indirect mechanisms of chronic contaminant stress on fish populations (1990) Monitoring Status and Trends in Marine Environmental Quality, , Symposium Proceedings, Vancouver, B.C., Environment Canada, Nov. 5–8, 1990; Addison, Fish hepatic mono-oxygenase in marine environmental quality assessment (1990) Monitoring Status and Trends in Marine Environmental Quality, , Symposium Proceedings, Vancouver, B.C., Environment Canada, Nov. 5–8, 1990; Bird, Rapport, (1986) State of the Environment Report for Canada, , Environment Canada, Ottawa, Ont; Cairns, Jr., van der Schalie, Review Paper: Biological Monitoring Part I: Early warning systems (1980) Water Res., 14, pp. 1179-1196; Ciammaichella, Johns, Ginn, Long-term exposure of Neanthes to toxic marine sediment (1990) Monitoring Status and Trends in Marine Environmental Quality, , Symposium Proceedings, Vancouver, B.C., Environment Canada, Nov. 5–8, 1990; Collier, Stein, Connor, Johnson, Casillas, Varanasi, Enhancements to NOAA's status and trends program (NSTP) (1990) Monitoring Status and Trends in Marine Environmental Quality, , Symposium Proceedings, Vancouver, B.C., Environment Canada, Nov. 5–8, 1990; Eaton, Hildebrand, d'Entremont, (1985) Environmental Quality in the Atlantic Region, , Environment Canada, Dartmouth, N.S; Elliott, Norstrom, Peakall, Whitehead, Pearce, Monitoring organic contaminants in Canadian seabirds, 1968–1990 (1990) Monitoring Status and Trends in Marine Environmental Quality, , Symposium Proceedings, Vancouver, B.C., Environment Canada, Nov. 5–8, 1990; Monitoring biological variables related to marine pollution (1980) IMCO/FAO/UNESCO/WMO/WHO/IAEA/UN/UNEP Report Series No. 11; GESAMP, Long-term consequences of low-level marine contamination: an analytical approach (1990) IMCO/FAO/UNESCO/WMO/WHO/IAEA/UNEP Report Series No. 40, , FAO, Rome; Goyette, The relationship of sediment contamination to the occurrence of preneoplastic and neoplastic liver lesions in English Sole (Parophyrs vetulus) from Vancouver Harbour (1990) Monitoring Status and Trends in Marine Environmental Quality, , Symposium Proceedings, Vancouver, B.C., Environment Canada, Nov. 5–8, 1990; Harding, Monitoring Status and Trends in Marine Environmental Quality (1990) Symposium Proceedings, Vancouver, B.C., , Environment Canada, Nov. 5–8, 1990; Howells, Calamari, Gray, Wells, An analytical approach to assessment of long-term effects of low levels of contaminants in the marine environment (1990) Mar.
