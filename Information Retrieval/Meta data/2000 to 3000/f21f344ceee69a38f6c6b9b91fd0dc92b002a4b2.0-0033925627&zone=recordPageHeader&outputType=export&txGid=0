Box 628, Moss Landing, CA 95039, United States","The gas hydrate phenomenon intersects with societal concerns about global climate change in at least two distinct ways: the possibility of destruction of gas hydrates exposed on or near the sea floor by global warming; and the possibility of avoiding this and other problems by taking advantage of CO2 hydrate formation during active disposal of fossil fuel CO2 in the deep ocean. This extraordinary picture of contemporary discussion of the possible destruction by mankind of one hydrate, and the creation of another, both in vast quantities in the ocean, is a tribute to the unusual nature and power of this chemical cage.",,"carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; climate; conference paper; gas; greenhouse effect; hydration; sea",,,,,,"Revelle, R.R., Methane hydrates in continental slope sediments and increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (1983) Changing Climate: Report of the Carbon Dioxide Assessment Committee, pp. 252-261. , National Academy Press; MacDonald, G.J., (1982) The Long-term Impacts of Increasing Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Levels, , Ballinger.
