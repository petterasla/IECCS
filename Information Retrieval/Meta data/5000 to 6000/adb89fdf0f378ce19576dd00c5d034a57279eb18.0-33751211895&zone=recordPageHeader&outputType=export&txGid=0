Of the biological responses to warming, changes in the timing of phenological events such as flowering are among the most sensitive. Despite the recognized importance of phenological changes, the limited number of long-term records of phenological events has restricted research on the topic in most areas of the world. In a previous study in Boston (American Journal of Botany 91: 1260-1264), we used herbarium specimens and one season of field observations to show that plants flowered earlier as the climate warmed over the past 100 yr. In our new study, we found that two extra years of data did not strengthen the explanatory power of the analysis. Analysis of herbarium specimens without any field data yielded results similar to analyses that included field observations. In addition, we found that photographs of cultivated and wild plants in Massachusetts, data similar to that contained in herbarium specimens, show changes in flowering times that closely match independent data on the same species in the same locations. Dated photographs of plants in flower represent a new resource to extend the range of species and localities addressed in global-warming research.","Arnold arboretum; Climate change; Concord, Massachusetts; Flowering times; Global warming; Herbarium specimens; Phenology; Photographs","documentary source; flowering; global warming; herbarium; phenology; photograph; Boston; Massachusetts; North America; United States",,,,,,"Barford, C.C., Wofsy, S.C., Goulden, M.L., Pyle, E.H., Urbanski, S.P., Hutyra, L., Saleska, S.R., Moore, K., Factors controlling long- and short-term sequestration of atmospheric CO2 in a mid-latitude forest (2001) Science, 294, pp. 1688-1691; Both, C., Bouwhuis, S., Lessells, C.M., Visser, M.E., Climate change and population declines in a long-distance migratory bird (2006) Nature, 441, pp. 81-83; Bradley, N.L., Leopold, A.C., Ross, J., Huffaker, W., Phenological changes reflect climate change in Wisconsin (1999) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA, 96, pp. 9701-9704; Cayan, D.R., Kammerdiener, S.A., Dettinger, M.D., Caprio, J.M., Peterson, D.H., Changes in the onset of spring in the western United States (2001) Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 82, pp. 399-415; Chmielewski, F.M., Rotzer, T., Response of tree phenology to climate change across Europe (2001) Agriculture and Forest Meteorology, 108, pp. 101-112; Fitter, A.H., Fitter, R.S.R., Rapid changes in flowering time in British plants (2002) Science, 296, pp. 1689-1691; Fitter, A.H., Fitter, R.S.R., Harris, I.T.B., Williamson, M.H., Relationships between first flowering date and temperature in the flora of a locality in central England (1995) Functional Ecology, 9, pp. 55-60; Fitzjarrald, D.R., Acevedo, O.C., Moore, K.E., Climatic consequences of leaf presence in the eastern United States (2001) Journal of Climate, 14, pp. 598-614; Harrison, A.E., Reoccupying unmarked camera stations for geological observations (1974) Geology, 2, pp. 469-471; Inouye, D.W., Barr, B., Armitage, K.B., Inouye, B.D., Climate change is affecting altitudinal migrants and hibernating species (2000) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA, 97, pp. 1630-1633; Inouye, D.W., McGuire, A.D., Effects of snowpack on timing and abundance of flowering in Delphinium nelsonii (Ranunculaceae): Implications for climate change (1991) American Journal of Botany, 78, pp. 997-1001; Lavoie, C., Lachance, D., A new herbarium-based method for reconstructing the phenology of plant species across large areas (2006) American Journal of Botany, 93, pp. 512-516; Ledneva, A., Miller-Rushing, A.J., Primack, R.B., Imbres, C., Climate change as reflected in a naturalist's diary, Middleborough, Massachusetts (2004) Wilson Bulletin, 116, pp. 224-231; Menzel, A., Fabian, P., Growing season extended in Europe (1999) Nature, 397, p. 659; Moiseev, P.A., Shiyatov, S.G., Vegetation dynamics at the treeline ecotone in the Ural highlands, Russia (2003) Alpine Biodiversity in Europe, Ecological Studies, p. 167. , L.
