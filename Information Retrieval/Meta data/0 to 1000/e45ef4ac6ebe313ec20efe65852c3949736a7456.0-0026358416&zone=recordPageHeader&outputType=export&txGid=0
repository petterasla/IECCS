Its concentration in the Earth's atmosphere has been increasing at a rate of about 1% per year during the last century, and reached 1·72 ppmv in 1990. Methane is a strong greenhouse gas with significantly adverse environmental impacts. On a molecule-for-molecule basis, it is more than 20 times as potent a greenhouse gas as carbon dioxide. The contribution of methane to global warming between 1880 and 1980 has been estimated to be about 15%, with an increasing share, ∼18%, during the 1980s. In this paper methods for estimating the change in atmospheric concentration of methane, and for predicting its global-warming effect, are described. Influences of some of the suggested emission-control policies are also discussed. Methane concentration in the atmosphere might reach a value of more than 4 ppmv by the end of the next century with no control policies implemented. This could produce an unavoidable long-term mean rise in the surface temperature of the Earth of more than 0·5°C. © 1991.",,"air pollution; atmospheric trace gas; emission control; environmental impact; global warming; greenhouse gas; methane; pollution problem; Global Warming; Methane; Air Pollution - Control; Atmospheric Temperature; Earth Atmosphere; Methane; Global Warming; Greenhouse Gas; Atmospheric Composition",,,,,,"Gribben, (1990) Hothouse Earth: The Greenhouse Effect and Gaia, , Bantam Press, London; Watson, Geller, Stolarski, Hampson, Present state of knowledge of the upper atmosphere: an assessment report (1986) NASA Reference Publication 1162, , NASA, Washington DC, USA; Ramanathan, Callis, Cess, Hansen, Isaksen, Kuhn, Lacis, Schlesinger, Climate-chemical interactions and effects of changing atmospheric trace gases (1987) Reviews of Geophysics, 25 (7), pp. 1441-1482; Mason, (1991) The greenhouse effect and global warming.
