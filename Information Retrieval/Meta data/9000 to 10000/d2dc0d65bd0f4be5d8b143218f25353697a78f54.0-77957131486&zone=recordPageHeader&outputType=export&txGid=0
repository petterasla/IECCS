The evolving trend of runoff in the future decades is forecasted based on the method of suppositional climate scenarios. The results indicate temperature variation in the region has an evident positive relation with global warming. Precipitation variations are quite intricate in the region at various geographic positions. Runoff in the region has been decreasing continually since the end of the 1980s, because the mean temperature in the region has been rising and precipitation in the main areas of runoff formation in the region has been decreasing. The increased magnitude of runoff may be more than that of precipitation because of the synchronously increasing supply of meltwater from snow, glacier, and frozen soils in future several decades. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.",,"climate change; climate variation; forecasting method; global warming; hydrological modeling; meltwater; precipitation (climatology); runoff; temperature gradient; China; Yellow River",,,,,,"Fu, G.B., Liu, C.M., Computation and analysis on influence of global warming to area water resource (1991) Acta Geographica Sinica, 46 (3), pp. 277-288; Hao, Z.C., Wang, J.H., Li, L., Wang, Z.H., Wang, L., (2006) Journal of Glaciology and Geocryology, 28 (1), pp. 1-7. , Impact of climate change on runoff in source region of Yellow River; (1999) Runoff and Sand in the Upper Yellow River, , Hydrology and Water Resources Office of the Upper Reaches of the Yellow River, Yellow River Water Conservancy Council, Yellow River Water Conservancy Publishing Company, Zhengzhou; (2007) IPCC, Summary for Policymakers of the Synthesis Report of the IPCC Four Assessment Report, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK; Lan, Y.C., Study on characteristics of spring runoff in the upper Yellow River basin (1989) Journal of Glaciology and Geocryology, 11 (4), pp. 384-390; Lan, Y.C., Ding, Y.J., Kang, E.S., Change trends of the annual runoff in the source region of the Yellow River and time series Markov-Chain for forecast model (2003) Journal of Glaciology and Geocryology, 25 (3), pp. 321-326; Lan, Y.C., Ding, Y.J., Zu, Y., Ma, J.H., Wei, Z., Possible Change on the Runoff in the upper Yellow River basin under global warming scenes (2004) Journal of Glaciology and Geocryology, 26 (4), pp. 668-673; Liu, X.D., Chen, B.D., Climatic warming in the Tibetan Plateau during recent decades (2000) International Journal of Climatology, 20 (14), pp. 1729-1742; Liu, X.D., An, Z.S., Fan, J.G., Possible variations of precipitation over the Yellow River valley under the global warming condition (2002) Scientia Geographica Sinica, 22 (5), pp. 514-519; Liu, X.Z., Tian, Y.Y., Researching influence of climate change to runoff by ameliorating nonlinear water balance model (1991) Advance in Water Science, 2 (2), pp. 120-126; Wang, G.Q., Shi, Z.H., The influence of climate change to the hydrological process of the upper Yellow River (2000) Henan Weather, 4, pp. 20-22; Wang, M.H., Xie, Q., Wang, H.Y., Impact of the climate change on runoff depth of the Huaihe Drainage basin (2003) Geographical Research, 22 (1), pp. 79-88; Wang, J.H., Kang, L.L., Yu, H., Analysis on the effects of climate change on natural runoff volume in the upper reaches of the Yellow River (1998) Arid Land Geography, 28 (3), pp. 288-291; Wang, S.L., Discussion on the permafrost degradation and the changes of the permafrost environment of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (2005) Advance in Earth Science, 13 (SUPPL.), pp. 65-73; Xu, L., Liu, Q., The long-range forecast for the summer regional rainfall in the Yellow River basin (2003) Journal of Nanjing Institute of Meteorology, 26 (1), pp. 116-123; Xu, Y., Ding, Y.H., Zhao, Z.C., Scenario of the temperature and precipitation on change in Northwest China due to human activity in the 21st century (2003) Journal of Glaciology and Geocryology, 25 (3), pp. 327-330; Zhang, S.Q., Wang, Y.G., Zhao, Y.Z., Permafrost degradation and its environment sequent in the Yellow River (2004) Journal of Glaciology and Geocryology, 26 (1), pp. 1-6; Zhang, G.H., Analysis on potential effects of global climate change on natural runoff in the Yellow River Basin (2006) Geographical Research, 25 (2), pp. 268-276; Zhang, G.Z., Xie, J.N., Ma, J.X., Several facts of global warming of arid climate in northeast part of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (2000) Xinjiang Weather, 23 (2), pp. 4-12","Lan, Y.; Cold and Arid Regions Environmental and Engineering Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, West Donggang Road 320, Lanzhou 730000, China; email: lyc@lzb.ac.cn",,,,,,,,10406182,,,,"English","Quat.
