Mean precipitation for the region has shown a significant downward trend from the 1950s to the mid-1970s, and a positive trend since the late 1970s. The change in trend' since the late 1970s, i.e. the period during which enhanced global warming emerged, is most prominent. The linear trend of the mean summer rainfall anomalies over the 4 subregions studied was + 7.5% decade-1. Changes in the trend of severe wet and dry events are not symmetrical. During the period 1977-1998, the number of severe wet stations increased at the rate of 20.3 decade-1, but the trend for severe dry events was only -5.4 decade-1. Similar rainfall changes can be found over many global land areas. The summer rainfall in eastern China showed only a negligible secular trend during the period 1880-1998. However, the decadal variations were clear. The mean rainfall in 1990-1998 was higher than for any other decade in the last 100 yr. The linear trend of the 33-station mean during 1977-1998 was +47.5 mm decade-1; such a strong increase is unprecedented in the record since 1880. Decadal variations and global warming may both play important roles in the recent significant increase in summer rainfall. This paper also presents the results of greenhouse and/or aerosol forcing experiments, in which summer precipitation over eastern China is generally estimated to rise. There are many uncertainties, however, in the regional precipitation simulations. For example, the modeled rainfall is sensitive to whether aerosols are included or not. Further research is needed to determine whether there is a substantial relationship between the rainfall changes in China and global greenhouse warming.","China; Global warming; Severe summer rainfall","global warming; rainfall; severe weather; summer; China",,,,,,"(1994) Atlas of Climatic Resources of China, , China Meteorological Administration China Map Press, Beijing; Dai, A.G., Trenberth, K.E., Karl, T.R., Global variations in droughts and wet spells: 1900-1995 (1998) Geophys Res Lett, 25 (17), pp. 3367-3370; Gaffen, D.J., Barnett, T.P., A comparison of observations and model simulations of tropospheric water vapor (1992) J Geophys Res, 97, pp. 2775-2780; Gong, D.Y., Wang, S.W., 1998: The warmest year on record in China during the last century (1999) Meteorol Monthly, 25 (8), pp. 1-4. , in Chinese; Gong, D.Y., Wang, S.W., Impacts of ENSO on rainfall of global land and China (1999) Chin Sci Bull, 44 (9), pp. 852-856; Gordon, H.B., Whetton, P.H., Pittock, A.B., Fowler, A.M., Haylock, M.R., Simulated changes in daily rainfall intensity due to the enhanced greenhouse effect: Implication for extreme rainfall events (1992) Clim Dyn, 8, pp. 83-102; Graham, N.E., Simulation of recent global temperature trends (1995) Science, 267, pp. 666-671; Guo, Q.Y., Summer monsoon and rainfall in China during the last 30 years (1981) Acta Geogr Sin, 36, pp. 187-195. , in Chinese; Hulme, M., A 1951-80 global land precipitation climatology for the evaluation of general circulation models (1992) Clim Dyn, 7, pp. 57-72; Hulme, M., Recent climatic change in the world's dryland (1996) Geophys Res Lett, 23 (1), pp. 61-64; Hulme, M., Wigley, T., Jiang, T., Zhao, Z.C., Wang, F.T., Ding, Y.H., Leemans, R., Markham, A., (1992) Greenhouse Effect Induced Climate Change and Its Impact on China, pp. 1-57. , Climatic Research Unit, Norwich/World Wildlife Fund, Glaud/ China Meteorological Administration, Beijing; Hulme, M., Zhao, Z.C., Jiang, T., Recent and future climate change in East Asia (1994) Int J Climatol, 14, pp. 637-658; Hulme, M., Osborn, T.J., Johns, T.C., Precipitation sensitivity to global warming: Comparison of observations with HadCM2 simulations (1998) Geophys Res Lett, 25 (17), pp. 3379-3382; (1990) Climate Change: The IPCC Scientific Assessment, pp. 131-172. , IPCC Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Johns, T.C., Carnell, R.E., Crossley, J.F., Gregory, J.M., Mitchell, J.F.B., Senior, C.A., Tett, S.F.B., Wood, R.A., The second Hadley Centre coupled ocean-atmosphere GCM: Model description, spinup and validation (1997) Clim Dyn, 13, pp. 103-134; Karl, T.R., Knight, R.W., Secular trends of precipitation amount, frequency and intensity in the United States (1998) Bull Am Meteorol Soc, 79, pp. 233-241; Karl, T.R., Knight, R.W., Plummer, N., Indices of climate change for the United States (1995) Bull Am Meteorol Soc, 77, pp. 279-292; Katz, R.W., Brown, B.G., Extreme events in a changing climate: Variability is more important than averages (1992) Clim Change, 21, pp. 289-302; Li, X.D., Zhao, Z.C., Wang, S.W., Ding, Y.H., Evaluation of regional climate change simulation: A case study (1994) IPCC Special Workshop on Article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, pp. 68-70. , 17-21 October 1994, Fortaleza, Brazil; Li, X.D., Zhao, Z.C., Wang, S.W., Ding, Y.H., Evaluation of CGCM and simulation of regional climate change in East Asia (1995) Acta Meteorol Sin, 9 (4), pp. 385-401; McGuffie, K., Henderson-Sellers, A., Holbrook, N., Kothavala, Z., Balachova, O., Hoekstra, J., Assessing simulations of daily temperature and precipitation variability with global climate models for present and enhanced greenhouse climate (1999) Int J Climatol, 19 (1), pp. 1-26; Mitchell, J.F.B., Johns, T.C., On the modification of the global warming by sulphate aerosols (1997) J Clim, 10, pp. 245-267; Nicholls, N., Gruza, G.V., Jouzel, J., Karl, T.R., Ogallo, L.A., Parker, D.E., Observed climate variability and change (1996) Climate Change 1995: The Science of Climate Change, pp. 133-192. , Houghton JT et al.
