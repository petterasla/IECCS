Heat waves have had debilitating effects on human mortality, and global climate models predict an increase in the frequency and severity of heat waves. The extent to which climate change will harm human health through changes in the distribution of heat waves and the sources of uncertainty in estimating these effects have not been studied extensively. Objectives: We estimated the future excess mortality attributable to heat waves under global climate change for a major U.S. city. Methods: We used a database comprising daily data from 1987 through 2005 on mortality from all nonaccidental causes, ambient levels of particulate matter and ozone, temperature, and dew point temperature for the city of Chicago, Illinois. We estimated the associations between heat waves and mortality in Chicago using Poisson regression models. Results: Under three different climate change scenarios for 2081-2100 and in the absence of adaptation, the city of Chicago could experience between 166 and 2,217 excess deaths per year attributable to heat waves, based on estimates from seven global climate models. We noted considerable variability in the projections of annual heat wave mortality; the largest source of variation was the choice of climate model. Conclusions: The impact of future heat waves on human health will likely be profound, and significant gains can be expected by lowering future carbon dioxide emissions.","Climate models; Extreme weather events; Global warming; Population health; Time-series models","ozone; adaptation; article; climate change; global change; global climate; heat wave; human; mortality; particulate matter; priority journal; quantitative analysis; temperature; United States; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Infrared Rays; Risk Factors",,"ozone, 10028-15-6",,,,"Analitis, A., Katsouyanni, K., Biggeri, A., Baccini, M., Forsberg, B., Bisanti, L., Effects of cold weather on mortality: Results from 15 European cities within the PHEWE project (2008) Am J Epidemio1, 68, pp. 1397-1408; Anderson, G.B., Bell, M.L., Weather-related mortality: A study of how heat, cold, and heat waves affect mortality in the United States (2009) Epidemiology, 20, pp. 205-213; Baccini, M., Biggeri, A., Accetta, G., Kosatsky, T., Katsouyanni, K., Analitis, A., Heat effects on mortality in 15 European cities (2008) Epidemiology, 19, pp. 711-719; Braga, A.L., Zanobetti, A., Schwartz, J., The time course of weather-related deaths (2001) Epidemiology, 12, pp. 662-667; D'ippoliti, D., Michelozzi, P., Marino, C., de'donato, F., Menne, B., Katsouyanni, K., The impact of heat waves on mortality in 9 European cities: Results from the EuroHEAT project (2010) Environ Health, 9, p. 37. , doi:10.1186/1476-069X-9-37, Online 16 July 2010; Doyon, B., Bélanger, D., Gosselin, P., The potential impact of climate change on annual and seasonal mortality for three cities in Québec, Canada (2008) Int J Health Geogr, 7, p. 23. , doi: 10.1186/1476-072X-7-23, Online 22 May 2008; Ebi, K.L., Mills, D.M., Smith, J.B., Grambsch, A., Climate change and human health impacts in the United States: An update on the results of the U.S. national assessment (2006) Environ Health Perspect, 114, pp. 1318-1324; Gosling, S.N., McGregor, G.R., Lowe, J.A., Climate change and heat-related mortality in six cities.
