Here, we have hypothesized that N2O emissions from paddy soils could be depressed by biochar incorporation during the upland crop season without any effect on CO2 emissions. Therefore, we have carried out the 60-day aerobic incubation experiment to investigate the influences of rice husk biochar incorporation (50 t ha-1) into two typical paddy soils with or without nitrogen (N) fertilizer on N2O and CO2 evolution from soil. Biochar addition significantly decreased N2O emissions during the 60-day period by 73. 1% as an average value while the inhibition ranged from 51. 4% to 93. 5% (P &lt; 0. 05-0. 01) in terms of cumulative emissions. Significant interactions were observed between biochar, N fertilizer, and soil type indicating that the effect of biochar addition on N2O emissions was influenced by soil type. Moreover, biochar addition did not increase CO2 emissions from both paddy soils (P &gt; 0. 05) in terms of cumulative emissions. Therefore, biochar can be added to paddy fields during the upland crop growing season to mitigate N2O evolution and thus global warming. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Biochar; Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Nitrous oxide; Paddy soil","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; charcoal; experimental study; global warming; nitrous oxide; paddy field; soil emission; soil type",,,,,,"Anderson, J.P.E., Domsch, K.H., A physiological method for the quantitative measurement of microbial biomass in soils (1978) Soil Biol Biochem, 10, pp. 215-221; Asada, T., Ohkubo, T., Kawata, K., Oikawa, K., Ammonia adsorption on bamboo charcoal with acid treatment (2006) J Health Sci, 52, pp. 585-589; Baggs, E.M., Smales, C.L., Bateman, E.J., Changing pH shifts the microbial source as well as the magitude of N2O emission from soil (2010) Bio Fertil Soils, 46, pp. 793-805; Beare, M., Gregorich, E., St-Georges, P., Compaction effects on CO2 and N2O production during drying and rewetting of soil (2009) Soil Biol Biochem, 41, pp. 611-621; Bouwman, A.F., Direct emission of nitrous oxide from agricultural soils (1996) Nutr Cycl Agroecosyst, 46, pp. 53-70; Chan, K.Y., van Zwieten, L., Meszaros, I., Downie, A., Joseph, S., Agronomic values of greenwaste biochar as a soil amendment (2007) Aust J Soil Res, 45, pp. 629-634; Chan, K.Y., van Zwieten, L., Meszaros, I., Downie, A., Joseph, S., Using poultry litter biochars as soil amendments (2008) Aust J Soil Res, 46, pp. 437-444; Clough, T., Bertram, J., Ray, J., Condron, L., O'Callaghan, M., Sherlock, R., Wells, N., Unweathered wood biochar impact on nitrous oxide emissions from a bovine-urine-amended pasture soil (2010) Soil Sci Soc Am J, 74, pp. 852-860; (2001) Chinese Soil Taxonomy, pp. 1-203. , CRGCST (Cooperative Research Group on Chinese Soil Taxonomy), Beijing, New York: Science Press; Czimczik, C.I., Masiello, C.A., Controls on black carbon storage in soils (2007) Glob Biogeochem Cycl, 21, pp. GB3005; Deluca, T.H., Mackenzie, M.D., Gundale, M.J., Holben, W.E., Wildfire-produced charcoal directly influences nitrogen cycling in Ponderosa Pine forests (2006) Soil Sci Soc Am J, 70, pp. 448-453; Davidson, E.A., Swank, W.T., Perry, T.O., Distinguishing between nitrification and denitrification as sources of gaseous nitrogen production in soil (1986) Appl Environ Microbiol, 52, pp. 1280-1286; Ekblad, A., Högberg, P., Analysis of δ13C of CO2 distinguishes between microbial respiration of added C4-sucrose and other soil respiration in a C3-ecosystem (2000) Plant Soil, 219, pp. 197-209; Forster, P., Ramaswamy, V., Artaxo, P., Berntsen, T., Betts, R., Fahey, D.W., Haywood, J., van Dorland, R., Changes in atmospheric constituents and in radiative forcing (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Basis.
