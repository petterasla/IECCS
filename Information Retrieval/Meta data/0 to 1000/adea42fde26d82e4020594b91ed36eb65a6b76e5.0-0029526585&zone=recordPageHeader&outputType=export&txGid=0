In simulation of climate change, loss of soil organic C ranges from 783 gC.m-2 in meadow steppe to 1485 gC.m-2 in typical steppe, and annual above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) decreases by 17.6 gC.m-2 in meadow steppe to 29.5 gC.m-2 in typical steppe. In the simulations of climate change plus elevated CO2 (from 350 ppm to 700 ppm), ANPP decreases by 5.4 gC.m-2 in meadow steppe to 11.3 gC.m-2 in typical steppe, while ANPP varies from an increase of 1.8 gC.m-2 in S. grandis steppe to a decrease of 20.6 gC.m-2 in meadow steppe. -from Authors",,"climatic change; grassland; net primary production; steppe; China, Inner Mongolia; Filifolium sibiricum; Leymus; Leymus chinense; Stipa baicalensis; Stipa grandis",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029526585
