However, the series of such data have short timescales (about 150 years). Indirect data from natural archives make it possible to judge specific features of climate changes in the more distant past. In contrast to indirect methods, when data are related to temperature through statistical correlations with air temperature, the borehole geothermal method makes it possible to directly determine the surface air temperature. The reconstructions of the temperature obtained using different indirect data for the Northern Hemisphere have been compared with the surface air temperature reconstructions based on the data of borehole thermometry and solar activity variations, and the possibilities of using the method in order to reconstruct long-term trends in climate changes have been indicated. © 2010 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,,,,,,,"Beltrami, H., Cheng, L., Mareschal, J.C., Simultaneous Inversion of Borehole Temperature Data for Determination of Ground Surface Temperature History (1997) Geophys.
