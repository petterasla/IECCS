The US and other donors are providing financial and technical support for climate change country studies to help meet their needs under the UNFCCC. Preliminary assessments suggest that GHG stabilization strategies should focus on fossil-fuel combustion, the primary source of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, and on forest management to sequester or conserve carbon (C). In selected countries, mitigation of methane (CH4) emissions from rice paddy, livestock production, and waste management are also considered relevant response options. Strengthening of human and institutional capacity to cope with global climate change issues will provide developing and transition countries with a sustained basis for meeting the goals of the UNFCCC. -from Authors",,"assessment strategy; climate change; emission inventory; emissions reduction; Framework Convention on Climate Change; greenhouse gas; greenhouse gas abatement; pollution control; US Country Studies Program; USA",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029667377
