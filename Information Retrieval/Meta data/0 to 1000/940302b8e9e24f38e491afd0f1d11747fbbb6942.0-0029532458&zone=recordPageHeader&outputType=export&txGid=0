The novelty of the term in policy analysis and policy making circles belies the longevity of this approach in the sciences and past attempts at their application to policy issues. This paper is an attempt at providing an overview of integrated assessment with a special focus on policy motivated integrated assessments of climate change. The first section provides an introduction to integrated assessments in general, followed by a discussion of the bounds to the climate change issue. The next section is devoted to a taxonomy of the policy motivated models. Then the integrated assessment effort at Carnegie Mellon is described briefly. A perspective on the challenges ahead in successful representation of natural and social dynamics in integrated assessments of global climate change is presented in the final section. © 1995.","Climate change; Climate policy; Integrated assessments","climate change model; climate change policy; climatic change; integrated assessment; integrated assessment model; methodological approach; modelling approach; policy making",,,,,,"Alcamo, Shaw, Hordijk, (1990) The RAINS Model of Acidification: Science and Strategies in Europe, , Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht; Benner, Pakulski, Mccarthy, Jr, Hedges, Hatcher, Bulk chemical characteristics of dissolved organic-matter in the ocean (1992) Science, 255 (5051), pp. 1561-1564; Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), (1992) World Factbook 1992, , US Government Printing Office, Washington DC; Cess, Potter, Blanchet, Boer, Del Genio, Déqué, Dymnikov, Zhang, Intercomparison and interpretation of climate feedback processes in 19 atmospheric general-circulation models (1990) Journal of Geophysical Research, 78 (10 D), pp. 16601-16615; Corell, (1993) Statement of Robert W.
