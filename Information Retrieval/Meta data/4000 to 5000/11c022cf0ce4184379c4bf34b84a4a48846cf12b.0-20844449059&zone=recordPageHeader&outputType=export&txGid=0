These components, however, are not properly measured by current EPA accepted methods, such as the R&amp;P TEOM monitor, due to loss of semivolatile material (SVM) from particles in the heated environment of the filter during sampling. The accurate determination of semivolatile material is important due to the possible effects of these species on human health, visibility, and global climate change. The concentration and composition of fine particulate material were determined using a combination of continuous and integrated samplers at the Brigham Young University-EPA Environmental Monitoring for Public Access and Community Tracking (BYU-EPA EMPACT) monitoring site in Salt Lake City, Utah over a six-day sampling period (30 January to 4 February) during the winter of 2001. Continuous samples were collected using a RAMS (total PM2.5 mass), a TEOM monitor (nonvolatile PM2.5 mass), an Aethalometer (elemental carbon), a TSI CPC (particle count), and a Nephelometer (light scattering by particles, b sp). Fine particle composition and mass were determined on a three-hour basis using the PC-BOSS diffusion denuder sampler. Total PM 2.5 mass-determined with the RAMS agreed with constructed mass determined from the chemical composition measured in collocated PC-BOSS-integrated samples. Results from this study indicate that semivolatile material (ammonium nitrate and semivolatile organic compounds) is a significant component of fine particle mass. Semivolatile organic compounds were the major contributor to light scattering during the six-day sampling period. Semivolatile nitrate, but not organic material, was suggested to be hygroscopic by the nephelometric data. The majority of the SVM observed appeared to be secondary material formed from photochemical reactions of the organic and NOx emissions from mobile sources and wood smoke combustion.",,"Climate change; Composition; Diffusion; Environmental engineering; Light scattering; Monitoring; Nitrates; Particulate emissions; Photochemical reactions; Sampling; Smoke; Volatile organic compounds; Organic materials; Particle composition; Semivolatile materials (SVM); Semivolatile organic compounds (SVOC); Particles (particulate matter); ammonium nitrate; volatile organic compound; article; atmospheric deposition; climate change; combustion; continuous flow reactor; global climate; nephelometry; particle size; photochemistry; priority journal; sampler; species differentiation; urban area",,"ammonium nitrate, 6484-52-2",,,,"Ding, Y., Pang, Y., Eatough, D.J., High volume diffusion denuder sampler for the routine monitoring of fine paniculate matter: I.
