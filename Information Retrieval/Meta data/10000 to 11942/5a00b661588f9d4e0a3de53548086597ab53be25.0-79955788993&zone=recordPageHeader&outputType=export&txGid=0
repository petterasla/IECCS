To assess the driving variables regulating redox potential, background parameters (dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, chlorophyll-a, soluble reactive and total phosphorus content of water, coverage and height of submerged macrophytes) and redox potential profiles around the sediment-water interface (SWI) were measured in simulated shallow lake ecosystems. There were two nutrient regimes (enriched and non-enriched) and three temperature scenarios (unheated; +3.5°C; +5°C) installed in the experimental setups, which were constructed to study the effects of global climate change. Temperature did not have any detectable effect on redox potentials, and we presume that nutrient addition had only indirect positive effects through triggering phytoplankton dominance which causes macrophyte absence. When submerged macrophytes were present in high density (80-100% coverage), redox potentials at the SWI varied between 60-215 mV and the mean redox potential was 133 ± 34 mV (mean ± 1 SD). In contrast to this, when phytoplankton dominance was coupled to low macrophyte density (0-20% coverage), the range of redox potentials at the SWI was 160-290 mV and the mean redox potential was 218 ± 34 mV. The results revealed the primary importance of submersed macrophytes; macrophyte coverage determined alone the redox potential of the sediment-water interface by 81%. This study suggests that possible positive effects of macrophytes on redox potential can be suppressed by their negative effects in case of 80-100% coverage and total inhabitation of the water column. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.","Macrophytes; Nutrients; Phosphorus; Redox potential; Temperature","chlorophyll a; climate change; dominance; lake ecosystem; macrophyte; pH; phytoplankton; population density; redox potential; sediment-water interface; shallow water; temperature effect; water column",,,,,,"Aldridge, K.T., Ganf, G.G., Influence of sediment redox potential by three contrasting macrophytes; implications for phosphorus adsorption/desorption (2003) Marine and Freshwater Research, 54 (1), pp. 87-94; Blindow, I., Hargeby, A., Andersson, G., Seasonal changes of mechanisms maintaining clear water in a shallow lake with abundant Chara vegetation (2002) Aquatic Botany, 72, pp. 315-334; Boros, G., Tátrai, I., György A., I., Vári, A., Nagy, S.A., Changes in internal phosphorus loading and fish population as possible causes of water quality decline in a shallow, biomanipulated lake (2009) International Review of Hydrobiolgy, 94, pp. 326-337; Boström, B., Jansson, M., Forsberg, C., Phosphorus release from lake sediments (1982) Archiv Für Hydrobiologie- Beiheft Ergebnisse Der Limnologie, 18, pp. 5-59; Boström, B., Andersen, J., Fleischer, S., Jansson, M., Exchange of phosphorus across the sediment-water interface (1988) Hydrobiologia, 170, pp. 229-244; Christensen, K.K., Andersen, F.O., Influence of Littorella uniflora on phosphorus retention in sediment supplied with artificial porewater (1996) Aquatic Botany, 55, pp. 183-197; Erhard, D., Gross, E.M., Allelopathic activity of Elodea canadensis and Elodea nuttallii against epiphytes and phytoplankton (2006) Aquatic Botany, 85, pp. 203-211; Gomez, E., Fillit, M., Ximenes, M.C., Picot, B., Phosphate mobility at the sediment-water interface of a Mediterranean lagoon (Etang du Mejean), seasonal phosphate variation (1998) Hydrobiologia, 374, pp. 203-216; Hilt, S., Allelopathic inhibition of epiphytes by submerged macrophytes (2006) Aquatic Botany, 85, pp. 252-256; Horppila, J., Nurminen, L., Effects of submerged macrophytes on sediment resuspension and internal phosphorus loading in Lake Hiidenvesi (southern Finland) (2003) Water Research, 37, pp. 4468-4474; Horppila, J., Nurminen, L., Effects if different macrophyte growth forms on sediment and P resuspension in a shallow lake (2005) Hydrobiologia, 545, pp. 167-175; Houghton, J.T., Ding, Y., Griggs, D.J., Noguer, M., Van der Linden, P.J., Dai, X., Maskell, K., Johnson, C.A., (2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis, p. 881. , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Hupfer, M., Lewandowski, J., Oxygen controls the phosphorus release from lake sediments-a long-lasting paradigm in limnology (2008) International Review of Hydrobiology, 93, pp. 415-432; Summary for policymakers 1 (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis, pp. 12-14. , IPCC, In Solomon, S.
