Regression analyses, spatial patterns and cross-correlations on the climatologic and hydrological factors suggested that industrialization processes and related urban heat-island effects during the past 37 years from 1968 to 2005 in South Korea have increased land surface temperatures by 1.267°C, at least for the urban areas, and subsequently increased sea surface temperatures by 0.975°C and decreased salinities by 0.229. The influence of land surface temperature on the sea water temperature reached at least 75-m depth. Regarding the causality in the land-ocean climate changes, air-temperature changes preceded sea water temperature change by 0-2 months in spring and summer, but the sequence could be reversed, possibly because of potential heat held bythe ocean. This study demonstrated that human factors have been driving warming influences on regional sea waters, impacting marine ecosystems and changing dominant fish species in commercial fishery catches of Korea. © Triveni Enterprises, Lucknow (India).","Air temperature; Climate change; Global warming; Korea; Salinity; Urban heat island effect; Water temperature","dissolved oxygen; sea water; air temperature; climate change; global warming; heat island; hydrological change; land surface; marine ecosystem; regression analysis; salinity; sea surface temperature; water temperature; air temperature; article; climate change; controlled study; correlation analysis; environmental impact; fishery; greenhouse effect; hydrology; industrialization; marine environment; meteorology; ocean environment; oceanography; precipitation; regression analysis; salinity; sea surface temperature; South Korea; spring; summer; urban area; water temperature; Animals; Climate; Ecosystem; Fisheries; Fishes; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Industry; Korea; Oceanography; Oxygen; Precipitation; Salinity; Seawater; Temperature; Time Factors; Urbanization; Asia; Eurasia; Far East; Korea",,"Oxygen, 7782-44-7",,,,"Axenrot, T., Hansson, S., Predicting herring recruitment from young-of-the-year densities, spawning stock biomass, and climate (2003) Limnol.
