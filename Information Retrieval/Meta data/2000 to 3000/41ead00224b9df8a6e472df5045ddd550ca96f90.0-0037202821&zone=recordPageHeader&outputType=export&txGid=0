A growing literature reveals that a change in the timing of natural events is occurring in a wide range of locations and affecting a wide range of species. Changes in spring have been those most commonly reported, with the emphasis on an advance in spring linked to an increase in temperature. Detection of change in autumn is hampered by a smaller pool of available data, events that are harder to define (such as leaf coloration), and various influencing environmental factors triggering autumnal phases. Despite this, the general pattern may be towards a delay in autumn. Plant, animal and abiotic responses, especially in spring, are quite similar. Thus, it would appear that winter is being squeezed at both ends, and this effect, of increasing the growing season, should become more pronounced in the face of predicted global warming. © 2002 Royal Meteorological Society.","Autumn; Climate change; Phenology; Spring; Temperature response; Trends","Biodiversity; Environmental impact; Plants (botany); Leaf coloration; Phenology; Climate change; autumn; climate change; phenology; seasonal variation; spring (season); temperature effect",,,,,,"Abu-Asab, M.S., Peterson, P.M., Shetler, S.G., Orli, S.S., Earlier plant flowering in spring as a response to global warming in the Washington, DC, area (2001) Biodiversity and Conservation, 10, pp. 597-612; Ahas, R., Long-term phyto-, ornitho- and ichthyophenological time-series analyses in Estonia (1999) International Journal of Biometeorology, 42, pp. 119-123; Bairlein, F., Winkel, W., Birds and climate change (2001) Climate of the 21st Century: Changes and Risks, pp. 278-282. , Lozan JL, Graßl H, Hupfer P (eds).
