The mammalian fauna, composed of 10,597 identified specimens, shows surprising affinity to the local habitat with little evidence of long-distance transport of faunal elements, thus revealing the faithfulness of a fossil site to the community from which it is derived. The mammals illustrate ecological sensitivity to a series of mesic to xeric climatic excursions in the sagebrush-grassland ecotone during the past 3200 yr. From 3200 cal yr B.P. to a maximum of 1100 cal yr B.P., the species composition of mammals indicates wetter conditions than today. Beginning about 1200 cal yr B.P., the fauna becomes more representative of xeric conditions with maxima in xeric-indicator taxa and minima in mesic-indicator taxa, concordant with the Medieval Warm Period (circa 1000 to 650 yr B.P.). Cooler, wetter conditions which prevailed for most of the Little Ice Age (700 to 100 yr B.P.) in general correspond to a return to a more mesic mammalian fauna. A warm period within the Little Ice Age is documented by a xeric fauna. These data show that mammalian ecological sensitivity to climatic change over this intermediate time scale holds promise for predictions about the impacts of future global warming. © 1996 University of Washington.",,"Artemisia tridentata; Mammalia; fossil mammal; Holocene; Holocene climate; mammal; mammalian fauna; palaeoclimate; palaeoenvironment; USA, Rocky Mountains; USA, Wyoming, Yellowstone National Park",,,,,,"Andrewartha, H.G., Birch, L.C., (1954) The Distribution and Abundance of Animals, , University of Chicago, Chicago; Baker, R.G., Holocene vegetational history of the western United States (1984) Late-Quaternary Environments of the United States, pp. 109-127. , (H.
