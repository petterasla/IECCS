This assessment will only be possible through a coordinated effort that combines all available technologies, that is an approach that builds on satellite image analysis, aerial survey from fixed-wing aircraft, and on the ground observation and measurement. ©iForest - Biogeosciences and Forestry.","Disturbance ecology; Global warming; Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem; Mountain pine beetle; Whitebark pine","Coleoptera; Pinus albicaulis; Pinus mugo; Scolytinae",,,,,,"Carroll, A., Changing the climate, changing the rules: Global warming and insect disturbance in western North American forests (2006) PowerPoint presentation: MTCLIM 2006 Conference, , http://www.fs.fed.us/psw/cirmount/meetings/mtclim/2006/talks/pdf/carroll_talk_mtclim2006.pdf, Mt.
