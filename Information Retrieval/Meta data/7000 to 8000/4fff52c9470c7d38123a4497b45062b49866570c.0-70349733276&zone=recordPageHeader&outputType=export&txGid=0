The tension that sometimes arises because of the different philosophical outlooks of these two modeling groups can be harmful because it tends to fractionate the effort that goes into the investigation of important environmental problems, such as global warming. In an attempt to improve this situation, the paper will outline a new Data-Based Mechanistic (DBM) approach to modeling that tries to meld together the best aspects of these two modeling philosophies in order to develop a unified approach that combines the hypothetico-deductive virtues of good scientific intuition and simulation modeling with the pragmatism of inductive data-based modeling, where more objective inference from data is the primary driving force. In particular, it demonstrates the feasibility of a new method for complex simulation model emulation, in which the methodological tools of DBM modeling are used to develop a reduced dynamic order model that represents the 'dominant modes' of the complex simulation model. In this form, the 'dynamic emulation' model can be compared with the DBM model obtained directly from the analysis of real data and any tensions between the two modeling approaches may be relaxed to produce models that suit multiple modeling objectives. © Springer-Verlag 2008.","Data-based mechanistic modeling; Dynamic emulation model; Hypothetico-deductive; Inductive; Modeling philosophy","Data-based mechanistic modeling; Dynamic emulation model; Hypothetico-deductive; Inductive; Modeling philosophy; Global warming; Ontology; Philosophical aspects; Simulators; database; environmental modeling; global warming; philosophy; simulation; software",,,,,,"Bayarri, M.J., Berger, J.O., Cafeo, J., Garcia-Donato, G., Liu, F., Palomo, J., Parthasarathy, R.J., Walsh, D., Computer model validation with functional output (2007) Ann Stat, 35, pp. 1874-1906; Bayarri, M.J., Berger, J.O., Paulo, R., Sacks, J., Cafeo, J.A., Cavendish, J., Lin, C.-H., Tu, J., A framework for validation of computer models (2007) Technometrics, 49, pp. 138-154; Beven, K.J., Young, P.C., Leedal, D.T., Romanowicz, R., Computationally efficient flood water level prediction (with uncertainty) (2008) Proceedings, European Conference on Flood Risk Management, , In Oxford; Box, G.E.P., Jenkins, G.M., (1970) Time Series Analysis Forecasting and Control, , Holden-Day, San Francisco; Conti, S., Gosling, J., Oakley, J., O'Hagan, A., Gaussian process emulation of dynamic computer codes (2007), Mimeo (submitted)Enting, I.G., Lassey, K.R., (1993) Projections of Future CO 2, , Technical Report 27, Division of Atmospheric Research, CSIRO, Melbourne, Australia; Goodwin, G.C., Payne, R.L., (1977) Dynamic System Identification: Experiment Design and Data Analysis, , Academic Press, New York; Gu, C., (2002) Smoothing Spline ANOVA Models, , Springer, Heidelberg; Hastie, T.J., Tibshirani, R.J., (1996) Generalized Additive Models, , Chapman & Hall, London; Higdon, D., Gattiker, J., Williams, B., Rightley, M., Computer model validation using high-dimensional outputs (2007) Bayesian Statistics 8, , In: Bernardo J, Bayarri MJ, Berger JO, Dawid AP, Heckerman D, Smith AFM, West M (eds) Oxford University Press, USA; Jakeman, A.J., Young, P.C., Refined instrumental variable methods of time-series analysis: Part II, multivariable systems (1979) Int J Control, 29, pp. 621-644; Jakeman, A.J., Young, P.C., Recursive filtering and the inversion of ill-posed causal problems (1981) Utilitas Math, 25, pp. 351-376; Kendall, M.G., Stuart, A., (1961) The Advanced Theory of Statistics, 2. , Griffin, London; Konikow, L., Bredehoeft, J., Ground water models cannot be validated (1992) Adv Water Resour, 15, pp. 75-83; Li, G., Wang, S.W., Rabitz, H., Practical approaches to construct rs-hdmr component functions (2002) J Phys Chem, 106, pp. 8721-8733; Li, G., Azarm, S., Farhang-Mehr, A., Diaz, A.R., Approximation of multiresponse deterministic engineering simulations: A dependent metamodeling approach (2006) Struct Multidisc Optim, 31, pp. 260-269; Liaw, C.M., Model reduction of discrete systems using the power decomposition method (1986) Proc Inst Electr Eng, 133 (PART D), pp. 30-34; Ljung, L., (1999) System Identification.
