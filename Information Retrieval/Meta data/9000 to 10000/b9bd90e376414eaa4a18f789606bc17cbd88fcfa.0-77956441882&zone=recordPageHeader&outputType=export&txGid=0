More recently, carbon emissions have greatly accelerated, thus much stronger effects on crops are expected. Here, we revise literature data concerning the physiological effects of CO2 enrichment and temperature rise on crop species. We discuss the main advantages and limitations of the most used CO2-enrichment technologies, the Open-Top Chambers (OTCs) and the Free-Air Carbon Enrichment (FACE). Within the conditions expected for the next few years, the physiological responses of crops suggest that they will grow faster, with slight changes in development, such as flowering and fruiting, depending on the species. There is growing evidence suggesting that C3 crops are likely to produce more harvestable products and that both C3 and C4 crops are likely to use less water with rising atmospheric [CO2] in the absence of stressful conditions. However, the beneficial direct impact of elevated [CO2] on crop yield can be offset by other effects of climate change, such as elevated temperatures and altered patterns of precipitation. Changes in food quality in a warmer, high-CO2 world are to be expected, e.g., decreased protein and mineral nutrient concentrations, as well as altered lipid composition. We point out that studies related to changes in crop yield and food quality as a consequence of global climatic changes should be priority areas for further studies, particularly because they will be increasingly associated with food security. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.","Food quality; Global climatic changes; Global warming; Nitrogen; Photosynthesis; Plant physiology","Atmospheric CO; Carbon emissions; Carbon enrichment; Climatic changes; Crop physiology; Crop yield; Direct impact; Elevated CO; Elevated temperature; Food quality; Food security; Human activities; Lipid composition; Literature data; Mineral nutrient concentration; Physiological effects; Physiological response; Plant physiology; Temperature rise; Global warming; Photosynthesis; Physiological models; Physiology; Crops",,,,,,"Ainsworth, E.A., Beier, C., Calfapietra, C., Ceulemans, R., Durand-Tardif, M., Farquhar, G.D., Next generation of elevated [CO2] experiments with crops: A critical investment for feeding the future world (2008) Plant, Cell and Environment, 31, pp. 1317-1324; Ainsworth, E.A., Davey, P.A., Bernacchi, C.J., Dermody, O.C., Heaton, E.A., Moore, D.J., A metaanalysis of elevated [CO2] effects on soybean (Glycine max) physiology, growth and yield (2002) Global Change Biology, 8, pp. 695-709; Ainsworth, E.A., Leakey, A.D.B., Ort, D.R., Long, S.P., FACE-ing the facts: Inconsistencies and interdependence among field, chamber and modeling studies of elevated [CO2] impacts on crop yield and food supply (2008) New Phytologist, 179, pp. 5-9; Ainsworth, E.A., Long, S.P., What have we learned from 15 years of free air CO2 enrichment (FACE)?
