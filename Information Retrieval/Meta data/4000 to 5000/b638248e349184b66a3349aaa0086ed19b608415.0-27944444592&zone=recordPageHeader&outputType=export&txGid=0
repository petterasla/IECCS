It is mainly based on the climatic proxy that we can study the past climate change. Although many achievements have been obtained, majority of the results are limited to the external characteristics of the proxy due to lagged analysis methods. For example, we judge if the climate is flood/drought or cold/warm through linear trend of the time series, however, we do not know whether it is a natural variation or the result of external forces, the mechanism is not uncovered. Because complexity of the open global climate system, there are different characteristics among the climatic proxies from different region of the world, from which it is difficult to reveal the intrinsic general principles i.e. the globality. For the further study on the past climate change, especially to reveal the rules of the global climate change in past 2000a and predict future climate change, a new method making use of the dynamical lag correlation exponent (named Q index in the text), a dynamics exponent based on the phase-space reconstruction, is introduced in this paper, which can effectively discern the similarities or differences between the dynamics of the two series. With Q index, we analyze the dynamics structure of some typical climatic proxies. The results show that the dynamics of climatic proxies are almost similar, and the regional climate keeps the same change with the global. In other words, regional climate is controlled by the global climate change. Besides, there are two dynamics jump periods (namely 700-900a and 1300-1700a) in past 2000a of the climate system, which may correspond to the periods of the medieval warm period and the little ice age, respectively.","Climatic proxy; Dynamical lag correlation exponent; Dynamics structure; Little ice age; Medieval warm period",,,,,,,,"Wan, S.-Q.; College of Atmospheric Science, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China",,,,,,,,10003290,,WLHPA,,"Chinese","Wuli Xuebao",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-27944444592
