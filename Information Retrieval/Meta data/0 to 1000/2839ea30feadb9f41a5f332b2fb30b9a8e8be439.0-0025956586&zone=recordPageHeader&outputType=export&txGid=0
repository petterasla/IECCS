Most natural disturbances are either directly or indirectly climatically driven and are affected by climate changes, particularly changes to hydrologic regimes. Most anthropogenic disturbances are microscale (10-1 to 106 m2) phenomena, but cumulative impacts associated with large developments, such as the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field, have affected mesoscale regions (106-1010 m2), and global warming could affect the tundra ecosystem at the macroscale level (1010-1012 m2). In the Arctic, recovery of the vegetation following disturbance is particularly closely linked to recovery of the physical system because of the presence of ice-rich permafrost. Maps of terrain sensitivity to disturbance must consider the influence of ground ice and heat flux to the system following disturbance. A three-tiered GIS hierarchy with five sublevels is presented, with examples of typical scientific questions being addressed at each level, scales and types of databases, and linking elements between levels. -from Authors",,"disturbance; geographic information system; landscape ecology; terrestrial ecosystem; USA, Alaska",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025956586
