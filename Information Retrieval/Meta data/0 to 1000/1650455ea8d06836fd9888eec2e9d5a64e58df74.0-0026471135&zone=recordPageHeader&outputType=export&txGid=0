In recognition of this fact, the Oceans and Coastal Areas Programme Activity Centre of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in 1987 established a series of regional teams to examine potential impacts of climate change and sea-level rise on terrestrial and marine ecosystems, on coastal environments, and on the socioeconomic structures of countries throughout the world. Drawing mainly on the work of the South Pacific Task Team, this article provides an overview of interrelated environmental problems and development problems in the Indo-Pacific region and reviews efforts to develop response strategies. The case of the Maldives is highlighted. © 1992.",,"climatic change; coastal environment; developing country; environmental impact; island nation; island state; man-environment relations; policy implication; sea level rise; sea-level rise; Indian Ocean, Maldives; Maldives; Pacific, (South)",,,,,,"Pernetta, The role of professional scientists and scientific organization in development (1984) Waigani Seminar Background Papers, 2, pp. 158-184. , R.J.
