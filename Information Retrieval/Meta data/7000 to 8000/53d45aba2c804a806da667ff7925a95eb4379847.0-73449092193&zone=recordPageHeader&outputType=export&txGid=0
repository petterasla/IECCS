We examined relationships between migrant condition and ENSO during spring migration in Costa Rica. Our study is based on correlating an ENSO index with body-condition metrics of six Nearctic-Neotropic migrant bird species during stopover in Costa Rica over a 10-year period. This study is the first to report correlations between El Niño and changes in condition of multiple migrant species. The condition of one insectivore improved, whereas two frugivores experienced reduced condition during El Niño. Our detected correlations suggest that the ENSO cycle may influence changes in migrant mass; such interactions may ultimately affect demographics of certain frugivorous and insectivorous migrant species. Potential future management considerations are discussed in light of global climate change and our findings. © The American Ornithologists' Union, 2009.","Condition index; Costa Rica; El Niñ; ENSO; O-Southern Oscillation; Spring migration","bird; body condition; climate change; correlation; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; environmental factor; migratory species; Nearctic Region; Neotropical Region; Costa Rica; Aves",,,,,,"ASKINS, R.A., LYNCH, J.F., GREENBERG, R., Population declines in migratory birds in eastern North America (1990) Current Ornithology, 7, pp. 1-57. , D.
