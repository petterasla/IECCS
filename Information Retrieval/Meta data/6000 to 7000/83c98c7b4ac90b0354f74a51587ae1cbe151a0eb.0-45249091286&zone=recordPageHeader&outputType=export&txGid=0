Interannual and decadal-scale variations are prominent features of Arctic climate, complicating the distinction between natural and anthropogenically driven variations. Nevertheless, climate models consistently indicate that the Arctic is the most climatically sensitive region of the Northern Hemisphere, especially near the sea ice margins. The Arctic marine environment has shown changes over the past several decades, and these changes are part of a broader global warming that exceeds the range of natural variability over the past 1000 years. Record minima of sea ice coverage during the past few summers and increased melt from Greenland have important implications for the hydrographic regime of the Arctic marine environment. The recent changes in the atmosphere (temperature, precipitation, pressure), sea ice, and ocean appear to be a coordinated response to systematic variations of the large-scale atmospheric circulation, superimposed on a general warming that is likely associated with increasing greenhouse gases. The changes have been sufficiently large in some sectors (e.g., the Bering/Chukchi Seas) that consequences for marine ecosystems appear to be underway. Global climate models indicate an additional warming of several degrees Celsius in much of the Arctic marine environment by 2050. However, the warming is seasonal (largest in autumn and winter), spatially variable, and closely associated with further retreat of sea ice. Additional changes predicted for 2050 are a general decrease of sea level pressure (largest in the Bering sector) and an increase of precipitation. While predictions of changes in storminess cannot be made with confidence, the predicted reduction of sea ice cover will almost certainly lead to increased oceanic mixing, ocean wave generation, and coastal flooding. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.","Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Climate; Climate change; Precipitation; Sea ice; Subpolar seas; Temperature","rain; sea water; snow; arctic environment; climate; climate change; island; marine environment; melt; Northern Hemisphere; open ocean; precipitation (climatology); sea ice; seasonality; solar radiation; storm; temperature; warming; Arctic; climate; review; season; temperature; Arctic Regions; Climate; Rain; Seasons; Seawater; Snow; Temperature; Arctic Ocean",,,,,,"(2004) Impacts of a warming Arctic: Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, , ACIA [Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK; (2005) Scientific report, , ACIA [Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK; Beesley, J.A., Regional and temporal variations in arctic cloudiness (2001) Sixth Conference on Polar Meteorology and Oceanography, 13-18 May, pp. 81-84. , San Diego, California.
