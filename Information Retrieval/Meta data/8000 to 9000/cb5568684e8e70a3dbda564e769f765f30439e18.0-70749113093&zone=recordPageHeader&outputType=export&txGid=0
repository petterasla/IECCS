However, such control is an energy intensive process that requires reliable energy supply. Concerns about future security of conventional supply, combined with the impact of fossil fuel emissions on global warming, has resulted in renewed emphasis on building energy efficiency. In achieving improved performance, natural ventilation and passive cooling methods are becoming important components of modern architecture in many countries. This editorial reviews some of the issues and barriers associated with natural ventilation and outlines recent progress. It also summarises the European Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) which, again, has an important impact on ventilation methodology in Europe. It is concluded that, for various reasons, natural ventilation is having a difficult time in gaining regulatory acceptance, even although there is strong demand for passive solutions from both private and public bodies. In the United Kingdom it is shown that, although a number of key official agencies strongly support the use of natural ventilation, the current Building Regulations and moves towards zero carbon buildings incorrectly acts against the benefit of natural ventilation. This, it is argued, is because a holistic view of total carbon emissions is not being taken into account. Ultimately it is the absolute CO2 emissions that impact on the environment but this is largely missing from the narrow objectives set by various regulations, standards and calculation techniques.","Air quality energy cycle; Climate impact; EPBD; Indoor air quality standards; Natural ventilation; Passive cooling; Regulations","Climate impacts; Energy cycle; Indoor air quality; Natural ventilation; Passive cooling; Air quality; Building codes; Buildings; Energy efficiency; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Indoor air pollution; Laws and legislation; Quality control; Standards; Wireless telecommunication systems; Ventilation",,,,,,"Bailey, C., Learning from passive action (2009) CIBSE Journal, pp. 29-31. , July, pp; BB101: (2006) Ventilation of School Buildings, Regulations, Standards and Design Guidance UK Government Dept for Children, Schools and FamiliesBornehag, C.G., Sundell, J., Hägerhed-Engman, L., Sigsgaard, T., Association between Ventilation Rates in 390 Swedish Homes and Allergic Symptoms in Children (2005) INDOOR AIR, 5 (4), pp. 275-280; BS Standard 5925: (1991) Code of Practice for ventilation principles and designing for natural ventilation(2009) Successful school design, , CABE: (, Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment UK; Trust, C., Heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), saving energy without compromising comfort (2006), Report CTV003Trust, C., Air conditioning - maximising comfort, minimising energy consumption (2007), Report CTGOO5CEN Standard 13779: (2005) Ventilation for non-residential buildings - performance requirements for ventilation and room-conditioning systems European StandardsCMHC: (1999) Research Highlights.
