Information of the effects of drought on aquatic ecosystems is limited and little is known of the effects on ecosystem functions. Our main objective was to measure the direct effects of drought on leaf litter breakdown by invertebrate shredders in a controlled laboratory experiment. We hypothesized a decreased breakdown at high drought level. Single-species and multi-species treatments with three shredder species (Asellus aquaticus, Limnephilus bipunctatus, and L. flavicornis) were set up in an experiment with three drought level treatments, control, medium, and high drought(6 cm water level,1 cm water level,and water level below sediment surface, respectively). Breakdown measured as leaf litter loss was significantly lower in both medium and high drought treatments compared to the control. Previously, decreased breakdown due to drying has been reported, but attributed to low densities of invertebrate shredders. We show that even when shredders are present, drought decreases the breakdown. Drought treatments also induced earlier pupation for the caddisfly L. flavicornis. Shifts in species phenology due to drought, e.g., earlier emergence, may affect species ability to adult survival and reproduction. Shifts in timing of emergence may also affect terrestrial food webs, where emerging aquatic insects may constitute an important food subsidy. Our knowledge of the complex effects of droughts in aquatic systems is limited with an urgent need of extended knowledge of the ecological effects of droughts on freshwater ecosystem functioning. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Aquatic insect; Decomposition; Emergence; Hydroperiod; Organic matter; Shredders","Aquatic ecosystem; Aquatic insect; Aquatic insects; Aquatic system; Asellus aquaticus; Complex effects; Controlled laboratories; Detritivores; Drought treatment; Ecological effect; Ecosystem functions; Freshwater ecosystem; Global climate changes; Hydroperiods; Leaf litter; Low density; Multi-species; On-stream; Organic matter; Sediment surface; Terrestrial food webs; Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Climate change; Ecosystems; Organic compounds; Sediments; Vegetation; Water levels; Drought; adult; caddisfly; climate change; decomposition; detritivory; drought; emergence; experimental study; freshwater ecosystem; hydroperiod; invertebrate; leaf litter; life cycle; louse; organic matter; phenology; prediction; runoff; stream; survival; Asellus aquaticus; Hexapoda; Invertebrata; Limnephilus bipunctatus; Trichoptera",,,,,,"Acuna, V., Munoz, I., Giorgi, A., Omella, M., Sabater, F., Sabater, S., Drought and postdrought recovery cycles in an intermittent Mediterranean stream: Structural and functional aspects (2005) Journal of the North American Benthological Society, 24, pp. 919-933; Altwegg, R., Predator-induced life-history plasticity under time constraints in pool frogs (2002) Ecology, 83, pp. 2542-2551; Andreasson, J., Bergstrom, S., Carlsson, B., Graham, L.P., Lindstrom, G., Hydrological change - climate change impact simulations for Sweden (2004) Ambio, 33, pp. 228-234; Bjelke, U., Herrmann, J., Processing of two detritus types by lake-dwelling shredders: Species-specific impacts and effects of species richness (2005) Journal of Animal Ecology, 74, pp. 92-98; Boulton, A.J., Parallels and contrasts in the effects of drought on stream macroinvertebrate assemblages (2003) Freshwater Biology, 48, pp. 1173-1185; Boulton, A.J., Lake, P.S., The ecology of 2 intermittent streams in Victoria, Australia.3.
