Since that time, the legislative and regulatory context that prompted extensive research has been in continual flux, leading to ever-new areas even as the original agenda set in the early 1990s has yet to be completed. Critical relationships between transportation behavior and air quality impacts have yet to be clarified, and more data and better analytical tools will be necessary before greater understanding is achieved. The advent of new strategies related to telecommuting, e-commerce, vehicle insurance, car sharing, and ""sustainability"" poses serious questions for the research community. Concurrently, new challenges abound spawned from current and future developments. New air quality standards have redefined the meaning of ""clean"" air. Air toxics loom as the next focus area from the 1990 amendments. New vehicle and fuel standards are being adopted. Greenhouse gases and global warming pose particular challenges for transportation, but radically new vehicle-fuel systems for cars, trucks, and buses show promise that the transportation community can again rise to meet these challenges. Knowing where the greatest air quality problems exist and how best to address them is the stuff of cutting-edge research, which will pose a challenge into the next decade. It is an exciting time to be in transportation and air quality.",,"Air pollution control; Air quality; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Laws and legislation; Strategic planning; Sustainable development; Clean air act; Transportation laws; Motor transportation",,,,,,"(1997) National Air Quality and Emissions Trends Report, 1997, , Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, Environmental Protection Agency; (1998) Strategic Plan for Environmental Research-FHWA 1998-2003, , Offices of Natural Environment and Human Environment, FHWA, U.S. Department of Transportation, April; Shrouds, J.M., (1995) Challenges and Opportunities for Transportation: Implementation of the Clea Air Act Amendments of 1990 and the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act 1991, , Kluwer Academic Publishers, Netherlands; (1997) Our Nation's Highways: Selected Facts and Figures, , Office of Information Management, FHWA, U.S. Department of Transportation; Chatterjee, A., Miller, T.L., Philpot, J.W., Wholley T.F., Jr., Guensler, R., Hartgen, D., Margiotta, R.A., Stopher, P.R., (1997) NCHRP Report 394: Improving Transportation Data for Mobile Source Emission Estimates, , TRB, National Research Council, Washington, D.C; (1995) Special Report 245: Expanding Metropolitan Highways: Implications for Air Quality and Energy Use, , TRB, National Research Council, Washington, D.C; (1999), http://www.epa.gov/oms/models/mobile6/m6awm98p.txt, Office of Mobile Sources, Environmental Protection Agency; http://www.epa.gov/oms/t2models.htm, http://www.epa.gov/orcdizux/lev-nlev.htm.
