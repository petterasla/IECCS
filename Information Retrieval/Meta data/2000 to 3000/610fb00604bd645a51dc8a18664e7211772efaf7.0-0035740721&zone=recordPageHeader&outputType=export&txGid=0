Refrigerator-freezers (RF), as one of the major home appliances, consume about one-fifth of the electricity in a household, and its life expectancy could be as long as 10-15 years. In response to future stricter regulations, several design options were considered for improving the energy efficiency of a conventionally designed domestic RF. The options, such as insulation improvements obtained by using vacuum insulation panels (VIPs), energy saving defrost control, and high-efficiency compressors were examined in a prototype RF. The energy consumption of the original 1997 production refrigerator-freezer was selected as the baseline in order to compare the measured energy savings of each option and the combined options on the prototype refrigerator-freezer. This study has reached a goal to develop a prototype that has an energy consumption rate of 20% less than the baseline model.","Polyurethane; Refrigerator; Thermal insulation; Vacuum insulation panel","Compressors; Defrosting; Domestic appliances; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Insulating materials; Greenhouse gases; Refrigerators; energy efficiency; polyurethane; refrigerator; thermal insulation",,,,,,"Fisher, S.K., Total equivalent warming impact: A measure of the global warming impact of CFC alternatives in refrigerating equipment (1993) Int.
