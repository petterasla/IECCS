Oxygen-poor conditions have far-reaching impacts on ecosystems because important mobile macroorganisms avoid or cannot survive in hypoxic zones. Climate models predict declines in oceanic dissolved oxygen produced by global warming. We constructed 50-year time series of dissolved-oxygen concentration for select tropical oceanic regions by augmenting a historical database with recent measurements. These time series reveal vertical expansion of the intermediate-depth low-oxygen zones in the eastern tropical Atlantic and the equatorial Pacific during the past 50 years. The oxygen decrease in the 300- to 700-m layer is 0.09 to 0.34 micromoles per kilogram per year. Reduced oxygen levels may have dramatic consequences for ecosystems and coastal economies.",,"dissolved oxygen; oxygen; climate modeling; dissolved oxygen; global warming; hypoxia; marine atmosphere; measurement method; tropical environment; article; Atlantic Ocean; coastal waters; global climate; greenhouse effect; Indian Ocean; marine environment; oxygen concentration; Pacific Ocean; priority journal; sea; time series analysis; tropics; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Tropical); Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Equatorial)",,"oxygen, 7782-44-7",,,,"Bange, H.W., Naqvi, S.W., Codispoti, L.A., (2005) Prog.

To ameliorate potential spatial bias due to recent sparser sampling, the meridional conductivity temperature depth and bottle sections used after 2000 were longitudinally centered within each area. Inspection of data distributions suggests that reported trends are not based on geographical shifts of data locations inside the investigation areas or seasonal shifts as a function of time, except as noted in the textSuspect data for 1989 were removed from Fig. 2D (offset from the surface to 1000 m), for 1963 from Fig. 2E (stations only in the southern part of the box), and for 1986 from Fig. 2F (oxygen increased from 400 m to a maximum at 1000 m)Linear trends and their 95% confidence intervals were estimated as in (23), using annual 300- to 700-m averages of the objectively mapped fields. Degrees of freedom for the confidence intervals were determined from integral time scales as in (24)Wunsch, C., (1996) The Ocean Circulation Inverse Problem, , Cambridge Univ.
