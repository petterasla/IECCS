The steps are self-financing and practicable, in that they are based on existing technologies. They involve agreement to create a new international agency charged with formulating and policing a global carbon pricing regime; a complementary step involving global monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions utilizing satellite resources; taking steps to compensate developing countries for preserving rainforest as carbon sinks; the dismantling of newly created trade barriers holding back global trade in biofuels; global promotion of a transition to renewable sources of electricity through facilitation of grid interconnections with independent power producers; a global moratorium on the building of new coal-fired power stations; and recycling of carbon revenues to promote uptake of renewable energy sources in developing countries, particularly Brazil, India and China. Taken as a group, it is argued that these steps are both necessary and sufficient. They call for institutional innovations at a global level that are politically difficult but feasible, given the magnitude of the problems addressed. © 2007.","Carbon pricing; Greenhouse gas emissions; Renewable energy sources","Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Energy policy; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Renewable energy resources; Societies and institutions; Global monitoring; Greenhouse gas emissions; International agency; Global warming; carbon emission; developing world; environmental protection; global warming; greenhouse gas; renewable resource",,,,,,"Adamson, S., Sagar, A., Managing climate risks using a tradable contingent security approach (2002) Energy Policy, 30 (1), pp. 43-51; Aldy, J.E., Orszag, P.R., Stiglitz, J.E., (2001) Climate Change: An Agenda for Global Action, , AEI-Brookings Joint Center for Regulatory Studies, Washington, DC; Aldy, J.E., Barrett, S., Stavins, R.N., Thirteen plus one: a comparison of global climate policy architectures (2003) Climate Policy, 3, pp. 373-397; Baranzini, A., Goldemberg, J., Speck, S., A future for carbon taxes (2000) Ecological Economics, 32, pp. 395-412; Barrett, S., Towards a better climate treaty (2002) World Economics, 3 (2), pp. 35-45; Barrett, S., (2005) Environment and Statecraft: The Strategy of Environmental Treaty-Making (with new Afterword), , Oxford University Press, New York; Bell, R.G., What to do about climate change (2006) Foreign Affairs, pp. 105-114; Berndes, G., Hoogwijk, M., Broek, R.v.d., The contribution of biomass in the future global energy supply: a review of 17 studies (2003) Biomass and Bioenergy, 25, pp. 1-28; Böhringer, C., Climate politics from Kyoto to Bonn: from little to nothing?
