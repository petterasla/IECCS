On average, Engelmann spruce populations were polymorphic at 80% of 24 isozyme loci, with 2.4 alleles per locus and expected heterozygosity of 0.255. The respective means for four populations of blue spruce were 42.7%, 1.6 alleles, and 0.138. Of total diversity, 14.7% was among populations in Engelmann spruce and 8.6% in blue spruce. In Engelmann spruce, numbers of alleles increased from south to north. Recent bottlenecks were indicated in the three southernmost populations of Engelmann spruce and in the northernmost population of blue spruce. Cluster analysis divided Engelmann spruce into a northern group and a Southwestern group; however, populations from Utah were distributed among both clusters. Genetic distance was correlated with geographic distance between northern populations but not between Southwestern populations, where drift predominated over gene flow. In two Engelmann spruce populations from Utah, multilocus outcrossing rates were 0.951 (±0.016) and 0.940 (±0.071). At Flys Peak, Arizona, the southernmost location of Engelmann spruce, outcrossing was also high, 0.899 (±0.017). Thus, inbreeding coefficients observed for parental (-0.104 to 0.047) and filial (0.011 to 0.026) generations were tow. Although Engelmann spruce seemed genetically robust, the evidence of bottlenecks in the southern extreme of its range suggested future problems in an era of global warming. © 2006 NRC.","Bottlenecks; Climate change; Diversity; Genetic drift; Selfing","Climate change; Genes; Plants (botany); Bottlenecks; Diversity; Genetic drift; Selfing; Biodiversity; climate change; cluster analysis; evergreen tree; gene flow; genetic drift; genetic structure; genetic variation; heterozygosity; inbreeding; polymorphism; population bottleneck; Biodiversity; Climates; Genes; Plants; Arizona; Chiricahua Mountains; Flys Peak; North America; United States; Utah; Picea; Picea engelmannii; Picea pungens",,,,,,"Review and atlas of palaeovegetation: Preliminary land ecosystem maps of the world since the last glacial maximum (1997) North America; comprising the USA, Canada, Greenland and 'Beringia, , http://www.esd.ornl.gov/projects/qen/new_na.html, Adams, J.M, and Faure, H, Editors, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tenn.
