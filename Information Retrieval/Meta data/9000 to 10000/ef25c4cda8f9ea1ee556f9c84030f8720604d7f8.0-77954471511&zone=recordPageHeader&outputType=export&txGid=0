In the American Southwest, increasing aridity is predicted to cause declines in stream base flows and water tables. Another potential outcome of climate change is increased flood intensity. Changes in these stream flow conditions may independently affect vegetation or may have synergistic effects. Our goal was to extrapolate vegetation response to climate-linked stream flow changes, by taking advantage of the spatial variation in flow conditions over a 200 km length of the San Pedro River (Arizona). Riparian vegetation traits were contrasted between sites differing in low-flow hydrology (degree of stream intermittency) and flood intensity (stream power of the 10-year recurrence flood). Field data indicate that increased stream intermittency would cause the floodplain plant community to shift from hydric pioneer trees and shrubs (Populus, Salix, Baccharis) towards mesic species (Tamarix). This shift in functional type would produce changes in vegetation structure, with reduced canopy cover and shorter canopies at drier sites. Among herbaceous species, annuals would increase while perennials would decrease. If flood intensities increased, there would be shifts towards younger tree age, expansion of xeric pioneer shrubs (in response to flood-linked edaphic changes), and replacement of herbaceous perennials by annuals.Woody stem density would increase and basal area would decrease, reflecting shifts towards younger forests. Some effects would be compounded: Annuals were most prevalent, and tree canopies shortest, at sites that were dry and intensely flooded. Vegetational changes would feedback onto hydrologic and geomorphic processes, of importance for modeling. Increased flood intensity would have positive feedback on disturbance processes, by shifting plant communities towards species with less ability to stabilize sediments. Feedbacks between riparian vegetation and stream lowflow changes would be homeostatic, with reduced evapotranspiration rates ameliorating declines in base flows arising from increased aridity. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Climate change; Flood disturbance; Populus; Riparian vegetation; Semiarid; Stream intermittency; Tamarix","baseflow; climate change; deciduous tree; flood frequency; flooding; flow pattern; hydrology; riparian vegetation; semiarid region; spatial variation; streamflow; Arizona; San Pedro River; United States; Baccharis; Populus; Salix; Tamarix",,,,,,"Amlin, N.M., Rood, S.B., Comparative tolerances of riparian willows and cottonwoods to water-table decline (2002) Wetlands, 22, pp. 338-346; Arnell, N.W., Effects of IPCC SRES emissions scenarios on river runoff: A global perspective (2003) Hydrology and Earth Systems Sciences, 7, pp. 619-641; Auble, G.T., Scott, M.L., Friedman, J.M., Use of individualistic streamflow-vegetation relations along the Fremont River, Utah, USA to assess impacts of flow alteration on wetland and riparian areas (2005) Wetlands, 25, pp. 143-154; Bagstad, K.J., Stromberg, J.C., Lite, S.J., Response of herbaceous riparian plants to rain and flooding on the San Pedro River, Arizona, USA (2005) Wetlands, 25, pp. 210-223; Baillie, M.N., Hogan, J.F., Ekwurzel, B., Wahi, A.K., Eastoe, C.J., Quantifying water sources to a semiarid riparian ecosystem, San Pedro River, Arizona (2007) Journal of Geophysical Research-Biogeosciences, 112 (G3), pp. S02; Baird, K., Stromberg, J., Maddock, T., Linking riparian dynamics and groundwater: An eco-hydrologic approach to modeling groundwater and riparian vegetation (2005) Environmental Management, 36, pp. 551-564; Baker, W.L., Macro-and micro-scale influences on riparian vegetation in western Colorado (1989) Annals of The Association of American Geographers, 79, pp. 65-78; Baker, W.L., Egbert, S.L., Frazier, G.F., A spatial model for studying the effects of climatic change on the structure of landscapes subject to large disturbances (1991) Ecological Modelling, 56, pp. 109-125; Barnett, T.P., Pierce, D.W., Hidalgo, H.G., Bonfils, C., Santer, B.D., Das, T., Bala, G., Nozawa, T., Human-induced changes in the hydrology of the western United States (2008) Mirin AA, 319, pp. 1080-1083; Bendix, J., Among-site variation in riparian vegetation of the southern California transverse ranges (1994) American Midland Naturalist, 132, pp. 136-151; Bendix, J., Stream power influence on southern Californian riparian vegetation (1999) Journal of Vegetation Science, 10, pp. 243-252; Bendix, J., Hupp, C.R., Hydrological and geomorphological impacts on riparian plant communities (2000) Hydrological Processes, 14, pp. 2977-2990; Bloschl, G., Ardoin-Bardin, S., Bonell, M., Dorninger, M., Goodrich, D., Gutknecht, D., Matamoros, D., Szolgay, J., At what scales do climate variability and land cover change impact on flooding and low flows?
