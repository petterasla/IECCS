These data suggest that neither the sensitivity nor the variability of the climate are fully captured in some climate-change projections, such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Summary for Policymakers. Because larger, faster and less-expected climate changes can cause more problems for economies and ecosystems, the palaeoclimatic data suggest the hypothesis that the future may be more challenging than anticipated in ongoing policy making. Large changes have occurred repeatedly with little net forcing. Increasing carbon dioxide concentration appears to have globalized deglacial warming, with climate sensitivity near the upper end of values from general circulation models (GCMs) used to project human-enhanced greenhouse warming; data from the warm Cretaceous period suggest a similarly high climate sensitivity to CO 2. Abrupt climate changes of the most recent glacial-interglacial cycle occurred during warm as well as cold times, linked especially to changing North Atlantic freshwater fluxes. GCMs typically project greenhouse-gas-induced North Atlantic freshening and circulation changes with notable but not extreme consequences; however, such models often underestimate the magnitude, speed or extent of past changes. Targeted research to assess model uncertainties would help to test these hypotheses.","Abrupt climate change; Climate sensitivity; Global warming; Last Glacial Maximum; Palaeoclimatology; Younger Dryas","carbon dioxide; Arctic; astronomy; climate; computer simulation; conference paper; greenhouse effect; methodology; paleontology; sea; sensitivity and specificity; temperature; theoretical model; Arctic Regions; Carbon Dioxide; Climate; Computer Simulation; Evolution, Planetary; Greenhouse Effect; Models, Theoretical; Oceans and Seas; Paleontology; Sensitivity and Specificity; Temperature",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9",,,,"Ágústsdóttir, A.M., (1998) Abrupt Climate Changes and the Effects of North Atlantic Deepwater Formation: Results from the GENESIS Global Climate Model and Comparison with Data from the Younger Dryas Event and the Event at 8200 Years BP and the Present, , PhD thesis, The Pennsylvania State University, PA, USA; Ágústsdóttir, A.M., Alley, R.B., Pollard, D., Peterson, W., Ekman transport and upwelling from wind stress from GENESIS climate model experiments with variable North Atlantic heat convergence (1999) Geophys.
