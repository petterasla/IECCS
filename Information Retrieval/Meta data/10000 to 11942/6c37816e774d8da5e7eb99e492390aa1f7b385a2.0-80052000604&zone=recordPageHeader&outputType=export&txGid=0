The year-to-year retreat of Northern Hemisphere sea ice extent is faster in summer than winter, which has been identified as one of the most striking features of satellite observations as well as of state-of-the-art climate model projections. This is typically understood to imply that the sea ice cover is most sensitive to climate forcing in summertime, and previous studies have explained this by calling on factors such as the surface albedo feedback. In the Southern Hemisphere, however, it is the wintertime sea ice extent that retreats fastest in climate model projections. Here, it is shown that the interhemispheric differences in the model projections can be attributed to differences in coastline geometry, which constrain where sea ice can occur. After accounting for coastline geometry, it is found that the sea ice changes simulated in both hemispheres in most climate models are consistent with sea ice retreat being fastest in winter in the absence of landmasses. These results demonstrate that, despite the widely differing rates of ice retreat among climate model projections, the seasonal structure of the sea ice retreat is robust among the models and is uniform in both hemispheres. © 2011 American Meteorological Society.","Climate change; Climate models; General circulation models; Sea ice; Seasonal cycle","Climate forcings; General circulation model; Northern Hemispheres; Satellite observations; Sea ice extent; Sea-ice cover; Seasonal cycle; Southern Hemisphere; Surface albedo; Computer simulation; Global warming; Landforms; Oceanography; Sea ice; Climate models; climate change; climate forcing; climate modeling; general circulation model; global warming; ice cover; ice retreat; Northern Hemisphere; sea ice; Southern Hemisphere",,,,,,"Arzel, O., Fichefet, T., Goosse, H., Sea ice evolution over the 20th and 21st centuries as simulated by current AOGCMs (2006) Ocean Modell., 12, pp. 401-415; Boe, J.L., Hall, A., Qu, X., September sea-ice cover in the Arctic Ocean projected to vanish by 2100 (2009) Nat.
