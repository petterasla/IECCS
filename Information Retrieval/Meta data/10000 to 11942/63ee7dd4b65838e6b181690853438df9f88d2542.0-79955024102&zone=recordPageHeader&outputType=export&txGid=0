A long-term fertilizer experiment in Chinese double rice-cropping systems initiated in 1990 was used in this study to gain an insight into a complete greenhouse gas accounting of GWP and GHGI. The six fertilizer treatments included inorganic fertilizer [nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer (NP), nitrogen and potassium fertilizer (NK), and balanced inorganic fertilizer (NPK)], combined inorganic/organic fertilizers at full and reduced rate (FOM and ROM), and no fertilizer application as a control. Methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes were measured using static chamber method from November 2006 through October 2009, and the net ecosystem carbon balance was estimated by the changes in topsoil (0-20cm) organic carbon (SOC) density over the 10-year period 1999-2009. Long-term fertilizer application significantly increased grain yields, except for no difference between the NK and control plots. Annual topsoil SOC sequestration rate was estimated to be 0.96tCha-1yr-1 for the control and 1.01-1.43tCha-1yr-1 for the fertilizer plots. Long-term inorganic fertilizer application tended to increase CH4 emissions during the flooded rice season and significantly increased N2O emissions from drained soils during the nonrice season. Annual mean CH4 emissions ranged from 621kgCH4ha-1 for the control to 1175kgCH4ha-1 for the FOM plots, 63-83% of which derived from the late-rice season. Annual N2O emission averaged 1.15-4.11kgN2O-Nha-1 in the double rice-cropping systems. Compared with the control, inorganic fertilizer application slightly increased the net annual GWPs, while they were remarkably increased by combined inorganic/organic fertilizer application. The GHGI was lowest for the NP and NPK plots and highest for the FOM and ROM plots. The results of this study suggest that agricultural economic viability and GHGs mitigation can be simultaneously achieved by balanced fertilizer application. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Carbon dioxide; GHGI; GWP; Long-term fertilizer experiment; Methane; Nitrous oxide; Rice paddy; Soil organic carbon","carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; crop production; cropping practice; experimental study; fertilizer application; global warming; greenhouse gas; methane; net ecosystem production; nitrous oxide; organic carbon; rice; soil organic matter; yield response",,,,,,"Adhya, T.K., Bharati, K., Mohanty, S.R., Ramakrishnan, B., Rao, V.R., Sethunathan, N., Wassmann, R., Methane emission from rice fields at Cuttack, India (2000) Nutrient Cycling in Agroecosystems, 58, pp. 95-105; Akiyama, H., Yagi, K., Yan, X., Direct N2O emissions from rice paddy fields (2005) Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 19, pp. GB105. , summary of available data., doi: DOI: 10.1029/2004GB002378; Bouwman, A.F., (2001) Global Estimates of Gaseous Emissions from Agricultural Land, , FAO, Rome, Italy; Bouwman, A.F., Boumans, L.J.M., Batjes, N.H., Emissions of N2O and NO from fertilized fields (2002) Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 16, pp. 1058-1070. , summary of available measurement data; Cai, Z., A category for estimate of CH4 emission from rice paddy fields in China (1997) Nutrient Cycling in Agroecosystems, 49, pp. 171-179; Cai, Z., Shan, Y., Xu, H., Effects of nitrogen fertilization on CH4 emissions from rice fields (2007) Soil Science and Plant Nutrition, 53, pp. 353-361; Cai, Z., Tsuruta, H., Minami, K., Methane emissions from rice fields in China (2000) Journal of Geophysical Research, 105 (D13), pp. 17231-17242. , measurements and influencing factors; Cai, Z., Xing, G., Yan, X., Xu, H., Tsuruta, H., Yagi, K., Minami, K., Methane and nitrous oxide emissions from rice paddy fields as affected by nitrogen fertilisers and water management (1997) Plant and Soil, 196, pp. 7-14; Cole, C.V., Flach, K., Lee, J., Sauerbeck, D., Stewart, B., Agricultural sources and sinks of carbon (1993) Water, Air, and Soil Pollution, 70, pp. 111-122; Dumanski, J., Desjardins, R.L., Tarnocai, C., Monreal, D., Gregorich, E.G., Kirkwood, V., Campbell, C.A., Possibilities for future carbon sequestration in Canadian agriculture in relation to included oat and alfalfa in the rotation had the greatest land use changes (1998) Climatic Change, 40, pp. 81-103; Follett, R.F., Soil management concepts and carbon sequestration in cropland soils (2001) Soil and Tillage Research, 61, pp. 77-92; Forster, P., Ramaswamy, V., Artaxo, P., Changes in atmospheric constituents and in radiative forcing (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis.
