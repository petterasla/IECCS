The limited hydraulic retention in the biogas reactor (typically 15 d) does not allow full degradation of the organic waste. Storage of anaerobically digested municipal organic waste can therefore be a source of methane (CH4) emission that may contribute significantly to the potential global warming impact from the waste treatment system. This study provides a model for quantifying the CH4 production from stored co-digested municipal organic waste and estimates the production under typical Danish climatic conditions, thus quantifying the potential global warming impact from storage of the digested municipal organic waste before its use on agricultural land. Laboratory batch tests on CH4 production as well as temperature measurements in eight full-scale storage tanks provided data for developing a model estimating the CH4 production in storage tanks containing digested municipal organic waste. The temperatures measured in separate storage tanks on farms receiving digested slurry were linearly correlated with air temperature. In storage tanks receiving slurry directly from biogas reactors, significantly higher temperatures were measured due to the high temperatures of the effluent from the reactor. Storage tanks on Danish farms are typically emptied in April and have a constant inflow of digested material. During the warmest months the content of digested material is therefore low, which limits the yearly CH4 production from storage. © ASA, CSSA, SSSA.",,"Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Degradation; Effluent treatment; Global warming; Temperature; Waste management; Hydraulic retention; Inflow; Municipal organic waste; Waste treatment system; Methane; biogas; methane; agriculture; air temperature; article; climate; degradation; Denmark; effluent; greenhouse effect; organic waste; reactor; waste management; Anaerobiosis; Fermentation; Methane; Organic Chemicals; Temperature",,"methane, 74-82-8; Methane, 74-82-8; Organic Chemicals",,,,"Davidsson, Å., Jansen, J.C., Gruvberger, C., Hansen, T.L., Christensen, T.H., Methane yield in source-separated organic fraction of municipal solid waste-thermophilic anaerobic digestion of waste from seven full-scale sorting systems (2006) Waste Manage, , in press; Hansen, T.L., Jansen, J.C., Davidsson, Å., Christensen, T.H., Effects of pre-treatment technologies on quantity and quality of source-sorted municipal organic waste for biogas recovery (2006) Waste Manage, , in press; Hansen, T.L., Schmidt, J.E., Angelidaki, I., Marca, E., Jansen, J.C., Mosbæk, H., Christensen, T.H., Method for determination of methane potentials of solid organic waste (2004) Waste Manage., 24, pp. 393-400; Hansen, T.L., Spliid, H., Jansen, J.C., Davidsson, Å., Christensen, T.H., Composition of source-sorted municipal organic waste collected in Danish cities (2006) Waste Manage., , in press; Husted, S., Seasonal variation in methane emission from stored slurry and solid manures (1994) J.
