These changes may lead to increases in soil freezing because of lack of an insulating snow cover and changes in soil water dynamics during the important snowmelt period. In this study, we manipulated snow depth by removing snow for two winters, simulating the late development of the snowpack as may occur with global warming, to explore the relationships between snow depth, soil freezing, soil moisture, and infiltration. We established four sites, each with two paired plots, at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF) in New Hampshire, U.S.A. and instrumented all eight plots with soil and snow thermistors, frost tubes, soil moisture probes, and soil lysimeters. For two winters, we removed snow from the designated treatment plots until February. Snow in the reference plots was undisturbed. The treatment winters (1997/1998 and 1998/1999) were relatively mild, with temperatures above the seasonal norm and snow depths below average. Results show the treated plots accumulated significantly less snow and had more extensive soil frost than reference plots. Snow depth was a strong regulator of soil temperature and frost depth at all sites. Soil moisture measured by time domain reflectometry probes and leaching volumes collected in lysimeters were lower in the treatment plots in March and April compared to the rest of the year. The ratio of leachate volumes collected in the treatment plots to that in the reference plots decreased as the snow ablation seasons progressed. Our data show that even mild winters with low snowfall, simulated by snow removal, will result in increased soil freezing in the forests at the HBEF. Our results suggest that a climate shift toward less snowfall or a shorter duration of snow on the ground will produce increases in soil freezing in northern hardwood forests. Increases in soil freezing will have implications for changes in soil biogeochemical processes.","Frozen soil; Infiltration; Snow cover","biogeochemistry; climate change; forest soil; frozen ground; infiltration; snow cover; United States",,,,,,"Berg, R., Johnson, T., Revised procedure for pavement design under seasonal frost conditions (1983) CRREL Special Report 83-27, , U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory, Hanover, NH, 129 pp; Bilskie, J., (2000) Personal Communication, , Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, Utah; Brooks, P.D., Williams, M.W., Schmidt, S.K., Inorganic nitrogen and microbial biomass dynamics before and during snowmelt (1998) Biogeochem., 43, pp. 1-15; Brooks, P.D., Campbell, D.H., Tonnessen, K.H., Heuer, K., Natural variability in N export from headwater catchments: Snow cover controls on ecosystem N retention (1999) Hydrol.
