This diversion launched a series of continuing legal controversies involving Illinois as a defendant against claims by the federal government, various lake states, and Canada who wanted the diversion stopped or drastically reduced. During the past 96 years extended dry periods have lowered the lake levels. Using these dry periods as surrogates for future conditions, their effects on the past controversies were examined as analogs for what might occur as a result of climate change from an enhanced Greenhouse effect. The results reveal that changing socioeconomic factors including population growth will likely cause increased water use, and Chicago will seek additional water from the Great Lakes. New priorities for water use will emerge as in the past. Drier future conditions will likely lead to enhanced diversions from the Great Lakes to serve interests in and outside the basin. Future lower lake levels (reflecting a drier climate) will lead to conflicts related to existing and proposed diversions, and these conflicts would be exacerbated by the consequences of global warming. In any event, a warmer, drier climatic regime will challenge existing laws and institutions for dealing with Great Lakes water issues. © 1996 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,"climate change; future prospect; lake level; sewage; urban supply; water demand; water diversion; water management; USA, Great Lakes, Lake Michigan; USA, Illinois, Chicago",,,,,,"Ackermann, W.C., Implications of the Maris Report', Proceedings (1968) Great Lakes Water Resources Conference, pp. 343-361. , Toronto, American Society of Civil Engineers, New York; Assel, R.A., Implications of CO2 Global Warming on Great Lakes Ice Cover (1991) Climatic Change, 18, pp. 377-395; Botts, L., The West May Reach for Great Lakes Water (1981) Great Lakes Communicator, 11, pp. 6-7; Cain, L.P., (1969) The Sanitary District of Chicago: A Case Study of Water Use and Conservation, p. 591. , Northwestern University, Evanston, IL; Cain, L.P., (1978) Sanitation Strategy for A Lakefront Metropolis, p. 106. , Northern Illinois University Press, DeKalb; Government's Response to UC Report on Further Regulation of the Great Lakes (1977) Communiqué No. 12, 12, p. 3. , Ottawa; Carroll, J.E., (1983) Environmental Diplomacy, p. 382. , The University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor; Changnon, S.A., Hydrologic Applications of Weather and Climate Information (1981) J.
