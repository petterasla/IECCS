The model included an enhanced definition of habitat indices, movements, and accessibility of tuna predators to different vertically migrant and non-migrant micronekton functional groups. The simulations covered the Pacific basin (model domain) at a 2°×2° geographic resolution. The structure of the model allows an evaluation from multiple data sources, and parameterization can be optimized by adjoint techniques and maximum likelihood using fishing data. A first such optimized parameterization was obtained for bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) in the Pacific Ocean using historical catch data for the last 50years and a hindcast from a coupled physical-biogeochemical model driven by the NCEP atmospheric reanalysis. The parameterization provided very plausible biological parameter values and a good fit to fishing data from the different fisheries, both within and outside the time period used for optimization. We then employed this model to forecast the future of bigeye tuna populations in the Pacific Ocean. The simulation was driven by the physical-biogeochemical fields predicted from a global marine biogeochemistry - climate simulation. This global simulation was performed with the IPSL climate model version 4 (IPSL-CM4) coupled to the oceanic biogeochemical model PISCES and forced by atmospheric CO2, from historical records over 1860-2000, and under the SRES A2 IPCC scenario for the 21st century (i.e. atmospheric CO2 concentration reaching 850ppm in the year 2100). Potential future changes in distribution and abundance under the IPCC scenario are presented but without taking into account any fishing effort. The simulation showed an improvement in bigeye tuna spawning habitat both in subtropical latitudes and in the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) where the surface temperature becomes optimal for bigeye tuna spawning. The adult feeding habitat also improved in the ETP due to the increase of dissolved oxygen concentration in the sub-surface allowing adults to access deeper forage. Conversely, in the Western Central Pacific the temperature becomes too warm for bigeye tuna spawning. The decrease in spawning is compensated by an increase of larvae biomass in subtropical regions. However, natural mortality of older stages increased due to lower habitat values (too warm surface temperatures, decreasing oxygen concentration in the sub-surface and less food). This increased mortality and the displacement of surviving fish to the eastern region led to stable then declining adult biomass at the end of the century. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Adjoint techniques; Adult biomass; Atmospheric CO; Atmospheric reanalysis; Biogeochemical models; Biological parameter; Climate model; Climate simulation; Dissolved oxygen concentrations; Eastern tropical pacific; Fishing effort; Global marines; Global simulation; Hindcasts; Historical records; Model domains; Multiple data sources; Oxygen concentrations; Pacific ocean; Population dynamics models; Potential impacts; Sub-surfaces; Subtropical latitudes; Subtropical regions; Surface temperatures; Thunnus obesus; Time-periods; Warm surface; Atmospheric temperature; Biogeochemistry; Climate models; Dissolved oxygen; Ecosystems; Fisheries; Functional groups; Global warming; Maximum likelihood; Oceanography; Optimization; Parameterization; Surface properties; Tropics; Weather forecasting; Computer simulation; abundance; biogeochemistry; biomass; breeding site; carbon dioxide; catch statistics; climate modeling; dissolved oxygen; ecosystem dynamics; ecosystem modeling; feeding behavior; fishing effort; forecasting method; functional group; global warming; habitat type; historical record; maximum likelihood analysis; micronekton; movement; optimization; parameterization; perciform; population distribution; population dynamics; sea surface temperature; spawning; Pacific Ocean; Scombridae; Thunnus obesus",,,,,,"Aumont, O., Orr, J.C., Monfray, P., Madec, G., Maier-Reimer, E., Nutrient trapping in the equatorial Pacific: the ocean circulation solution (1999) Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 13, pp. 351-369; Aumont, O., Bopp, L., Globalizing results from ocean in situ iron fertilization studies (2006) Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 20, pp. GB2017; Bard, Y., (1974) Nonlinear Parameter Estimation, , Academic Press, New York, USA; Behrenfeld, M.J., O'Malley, R.T., Siegel, D.A., McClain, C.R., Sarmiento, J.L., Feldman, G.C., Milligan, A.J., Boss, E.S., Climate-driven trends in contemporary ocean productivity (2006) Nature, 444, pp. 752-755; Behrenfeld, M.J., Falkowski, P.G., A consumer's guide to phytoplankton primary productivity models (1997) Limnology and Oceanography, 42, pp. 1479-1491; Bopp, L., LeQuéré, C., Heimann, M., Manning, A.C., Monfray, P., Climate-induced oceanic oxygen fluxes: implications for the contemporary carbon budget (2002) Global Biogeochemical Cycles, p. 16. , doi:10.10292001GB001445; Bopp, L., Monfray, P., Aumont, O., Dufresne, J.L., Le Treut, H., Madec, G., Terray, L., Orr, J.C., Potential impact of climate change on marine export production (2001) Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 15, pp. 81-99; Bopp, L., Aumont, O., Cadule, P., Alvain, S., Gehlen, M., Response of diatoms distribution to global warming and potential implications: a global model study (2005) Geophysical Research Letters, 32 (19), pp. L19606; Boyd, P.W., Doney, S.C., Modeling regional responses by marine pelagic ecosystems to global climate change (2002) Geophysical Research Letter, 29 (16), p. 1806; Brill, R.W., A review of temperature and oxygen tolerance studies of tunas pertinent to fisheries oceanography, movement models and stock assessments (1994) Fisheries Oceanography, 3, pp. 204-216; Carton, J.A., Chepurin, G., Cao, X., Giese, B.S., A simple ocean data assimilation analysis of the global upper ocean 1950-1995.
