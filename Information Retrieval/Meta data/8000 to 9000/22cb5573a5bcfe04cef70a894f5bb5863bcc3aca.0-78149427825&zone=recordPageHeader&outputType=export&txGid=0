The spread and population density of E. crassipes will be favored by global warming. The aim here was to identify compounds that underlie the effects on microbes. The entire plant of E. crassipes was collected from El Zomor canal, River Nile (Egypt), washed clean, then air dried. Plant tissue was extracted three times with methanol and fractionated by thin layer chromatography (TLC). The crude methanolic extract and five fractions from TLC (A-E) were tested for antimicrobial (bacteria and fungal) and anti-algal activities (green microalgae and cyanobacteria) using paper disc diffusion bioassay. The crude extract as well as all five TLC fractions exhibited antibacterial activities against both the Gram positive bacteria; Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus faecalis; and the Gram negative bacteria; Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Growth of Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger were not inhibited by either E. crassipes crude extract nor its five fractions. In contrast, Candida albicans (yeast) was inhibited by all. Some antialgal activity of the crude extract and its fractions was manifest against the green microalgae; Chlorella vulgaris and Dictyochloropsis splendida as well as the cyanobacteria; Spirulina platensis and Nostoc piscinale. High antialgal activity was only recorded against Chlorella vulgaris. Identifications of the active antimicrobial and antialgal compounds of the crude extract as well as the five TLC fractions were carried out using gas chromatography combined with mass spectroscopy. The analyses showed the presence of an alkaloid (fraction A) and four phthalate derivatives (Fractions B-E) that exhibited the antimicrobial and antialgal activities. © 2010 Shanab et al.",,"16,17,20,21 tetradehydro 16 (hydroxymethyl) 18,19 secoyohimban 19 oic acid methyl ester; alkaloid; amphotericin B; antiinfective agent; Eichhornia crassipes extract; herbaceous agent; methanol; methyl dioctyl phthalate; phthalic acid 2 ethylhexyl monoester; phthalic acid diisooctyl ester; phthalic acid dioctyl ester; plant extract; tetracycline; unclassified drug; antiinfective agent; plant extract; allelopathy; antifungal activity; antimicrobial activity; article; Aspergillus flavus; Aspergillus niger; Bacillus subtilis; bacterial strain; Candida albicans; Chlorella vulgaris; controlled study; disk diffusion; drug screening; drug structure; Egypt; Eichhornia; Enterococcus faecalis; Escherichia coli; fungal strain; gas chromatography; growth inhibition; mass spectrometry; minimum inhibitory concentration; nonhuman; Nostoc; Nostoc piscinale; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; Spirulina platensis; Staphylococcus aureus; thin layer chromatography; water hyacinth; Eichhornia; infrared spectroscopy; isolation and purification; mass fragmentography; microbiological examination; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; physiology; algae; Aspergillus flavus; Aspergillus niger; Bacillus subtilis; Candida albicans; Chlorella vulgaris; Cyanobacteria; Dictyochloropsis; Eichhornia crassipes; Enterococcus faecalis; Escherichia coli; Negibacteria; Nostoc piscinale; Posibacteria; Spirulina platensis; Staphylococcus aureus; Anti-Infective Agents; Chromatography, Thin Layer; Eichhornia; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Plant Extracts; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared",,"amphotericin B, 1397-89-3, 30652-87-0; methanol, 67-56-1; phthalic acid 2 ethylhexyl monoester, 4376-20-9; phthalic acid diisooctyl ester, 27554-26-3; phthalic acid dioctyl ester, 117-84-0; tetracycline, 23843-90-5, 60-54-8, 64-75-5, 8021-86-1; Anti-Infective Agents; Plant Extracts",,"Sigma, United States",,"Gao-Lei, Bo, L., The study of a specious invasive plant, water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes): Achievements and challenges (2004) Acta-Phytoecologica-Sinica, 28, pp. 735-752; Dandelot, S., Robles, C., Pech, N., Cazaubon, A., Verlaque, R., Allelopathic potential of two invasive alien Ludwigia spp (2008) Aquatic Botany, 88, pp. 311-316; Khattab, A.F., The problem of water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) in Egypt and methods of management (1988) International workshop on water hyacinth, Lagos, pp. 303-313; Awad, H.E.A., (2008) Ecology and Adaptation of water hyacinth in the Nile Delta Ecosystem, p. 116. , M.SC., thesis, Botany Dept.
