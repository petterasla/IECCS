The success of mitigation initiatives depends on the long-term net balance between carbon gains and losses. The biodiversity of ecological communities, including composition and variability of traits of plants and soil organisms, can alter this balance in several ways. This influence can be direct, through determining the magnitude, turnover rate, and longevity of carbon stocks in soil and vegetation. It can also be indirect through influencing the value and therefore the protection that societies give to ecosystems and their carbon stocks. Biodiversity of forested ecosystems has important consequences for long-term carbon storage, and thus warrants incorporation into the design, implementation, and regulatory framework of mitigation initiatives. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

(2009) Biogeosciences, 6, pp. 297-307. , This study examines the links between plant traits and ecosystem properties at large spatial scale in the Amazon. They show that biomass and coarse wood production have different sensitivities to functional composition of vegetation, and that, at this coarse spatial scale, coarse wood production depends more strongly on environmental factors than on plant functional traits; Lal, R., Soil carbon sequestration for sustaining agricultural production and improving the environment with particular reference to Brazil (2005) J Sustain Agric, 26, pp. 23-42; Jobbágy, E., Jackson, R.B., The vertical distribution of soil organic carbon and its relation to climate and vegetation (2000) Ecol Appl, 10, pp. 423-436; Jandl, R., Lindner, M., Vesterdal, L., Bauwens, B., Baritz, R., Hagedorn, F., Johnson, D.W., Byrne, K.A., How strongly can forest management influence soil carbon sequestration?

It includes a discussion of positive and negative aspects as compared to large-scale reforestation programs; Gullison, R.E., Frumhoff, P.C., Canadell, J.G., Field, C.B., Nepstad, D.C., Hayhoe, K., Avissar, R., Jones, C.D., Tropical forests and climate policy (2007) Science, 316, pp. 985-986; Malhi, Y., Roberts, J.T., Betts, R.A., Killeen, T.J., Li, W.H., Nobre, C.A., Climate change, deforestation, and the fate of the Amazon (2008) Science, 319, pp. 169-172; Fischlin, A., Midgley, G., Price, J., Leemans, R., Gopal, B., Turley, C., Rounsevell, M., Velichko, A., Ecosystems, their properties, goods, and services (2007) Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability.

Comprehensive worldwide analysis of forests state and trends, and adaptation and mitigation options in the face of global change; Lewis, S.L., López-González, G., Sonke, B., Affum-Baffoe, K., Baker, T.R., Ojo, L.O., Phillips, O.L., Comiskey, J.A., Increasing carbon storage in intact African tropical forests (2009) Nature, 457, pp. 1003-1006. , Comparative measurement of monitoring plots provides evidence of increasing aboveground carbon storage in old-growth tropical forests throughout Africa, much as has been shown in Amazonia. This points to these forests increasingly functioning as a carbon sink, likely as a result of global change phenomena; Luyssaert, S., Schulze, E.-D., Borner, A., Knohl, A., Hessenmoller, D., Law, B.E., Ciais, P., Grace, J., Old-growth forests as global carbon sinks (2008) Nature, 455, pp. 213-215. , Analysis of forest carbon-flux estimates shows that forest net carbon balance including soils is usually positive in forest between 15 and 800 years of age. This indicates that undisturbed old-growth forests can continue to accumulate carbon for centuries. Together with Ref. [18••], this contradicts the long-standing view that old-growth forests are carbon neutral and thus highlights the importance of considering them in climate change mitigation strategies; (2007) Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability.
