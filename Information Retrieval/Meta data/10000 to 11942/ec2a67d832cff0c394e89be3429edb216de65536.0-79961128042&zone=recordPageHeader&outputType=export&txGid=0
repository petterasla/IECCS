Global-scale crop yields were calculated using iGAEZ model for the period of 1990-1999. Through comparing simulated yields and FAO statistics, iGAEZ has demonstrated a very good ability to reproduce realistic crop yields on a global scale. We also predicted the impact of global warming on crop yields from the 1990s to 2090s by projecting five GCM outputs for AR4 under SRES A1B scenarios. According to the result, temperature rise will make many cultivated areas (eastern part of USA, India, eastern China, Africa) less productive. On the other hand, the regions with cold weather under current climate condition (Canada, northern Europe, northeastern China) become suitable for crop productivity under future climate scenario. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Crop yields; GCM; IGAEZ; Irrigation; SRES A1B","Agro-ecological zones; Cereals production; Climate change scenarios; Climate condition; Cold weather; Crop condition; Crop productivity; Crop yield; Eastern China; Future climate; GCM; Global scale; Green beans; Growth cycle; IGAEZ; Optimum criteria; Potential change; SRES A1B; Sweet potato; Temperature rise; Crops; Global warming; Climate models; cereal; climate effect; crop production; crop yield; estimation method; global warming; growth response; irrigation; temperature effect; yield response; Canada; China; Northern Europe; Glycine max; Ipomoea batatas; Manihot esculenta; Solanum tuberosum; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",,,,,,"Döll, P., Siebert, S., A digital map of irrigated areas (2000) International Commission on Irrigation and Drainage, 49 (2), pp. 55-66; Döll, P., Siebert, S., Global modeling of irrigation water requirements (2002) Water Resources Research, 38 (4), p. 1037. , DOI:10.1029/2000WR 900130; Donald, O., Ingco, D., Duncan, C., (1997) The world food outlook, pp. 44-51. , Cambridge University Press:; Report on the agro-ecological zones project.
