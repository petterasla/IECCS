The International Panel of Climate Change stated that there would be a steady increase in the ambient temperature during the end of the 21st century. This increase will impact the built environment, particularly the requirements of energy consumption in residential buildings. In this case, there is a need to measure sustainable planning practices in building construction projects. Research has shown a relationship between planning and better project performance and between more sustainable planning and better project performance. This paper presents global warming and energy consumption on residential buildings for environmental sustainability.
