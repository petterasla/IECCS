Few studies, however, have investigated this highly dynamic response at relevant temporal and spatial scales. A combination of leaf and whole-tree measurements and stand-level extrapolations were used to assess how stomatal conductance, canopy transpiration and conductance, and evapotranspiration might be affected by future, higher CO2 concentrations. Midday measurements of stomatal conductance for leaves sampled in a 12-yr-old sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua) stand exposed to free-air CO2 enrichment were up to 44% lower at elevated than at ambient CO2 concentrations, whereas canopy conductance, averaged over the growing season, was only 14% lower in stands exposed to CO2 enrichment. The magnitude of this response was dependent on vapor pressure deficit and soil water potential. Annual estimates of evapotranspiration showed relatively small reductions due to atmospheric CO2 enrichment. These data illustrate that the hydrological response of a closed-canopy plantation to elevated CO2 depends on the temporal and spatial scale of observation. They emphasize the importance of interacting variables and confirm that integration of measurements over space and time reduce what, at the leaf level, might otherwise appear to be a large and significant response.","Canopy transpiration; Evapotranspiration; Forest water use; Global change; Liquidambar styraciflua (sweetgum); Sap velocity; Transpiration","carbon dioxide enrichment; forest canopy; hydrological response; stomatal conductance; Liquidambar; Liquidambar styraciflua",,,,,,"Baker, J.T., Allen Jr., L.H., Assessment of the impact of rising carbon dioxide and other potential climate changes on vegetation (1994) Environmental Pollution, 83, pp. 223-235; Baumgartner, A., Reichel, E., (1975) The World Water Balance, , New York, USA: Elsevier; Beerling, D.J., Heath, J., Woodward, F.I., Mansfield, T.A., Drought-CO2 interactions in trees: Observations and mechanisms (1996) New Phytologist, 134, pp. 235-242; Bremer, D.J., Ham, J.M., Owensby, C.E., Effect of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide and open-top chambers on transpiration in a tallgrass prairie (1996) Journal of Environmental Quality, 25, pp. 691-701; Curtis, P.S., A meta-analysis of leaf gas exchange and nitrogen in trees grown under elevated carbon dioxide (1996) Plant, Cell & Environment, 19, pp. 127-137; Curtis, P.S., Wang, X., A meta-analysis of elevated CO2 effects on woody plant mass, form, and physiology (1998) Oecologia, 113, pp. 299-313; DeLucia, E.H., Thomas, R.B., Photosynthetic responses to CO2 enrichment of four hardwood species in a forest understory (2000) Oecologia, 122, pp. 11-19; Drake, B.G., Gonzàlez-Meler, M.A., Long, S.P., More efficient plants: A consequence of rising atmospheric CO2?
