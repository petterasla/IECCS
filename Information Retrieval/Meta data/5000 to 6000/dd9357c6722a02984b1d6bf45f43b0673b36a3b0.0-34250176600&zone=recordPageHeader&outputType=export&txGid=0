Results indicate that E. prunastri can tolerate a temperature of 40°C for 24 h, but for longer periods a reduction in chlorophyll b is apparent, suggesting that chlorophyll b could be used as a valuable parameter to detect changes caused by prolonged exposure to such temperatures. Exposure of E. prunastri to a temperature of 80°C had strongly negative effects on the content of photosynthetic pigments, causing both inhibition of chlorophyll synthesis and chlorophyll degradation to phaeophytin; slow acclimation was not capable of preventing such damage. Damage to cell membranes, as indicated by changes in electrical conductivity of the medium, proved to be a useful and simple tool for measuring damage caused by high temperatures. Besides the effects of temperature, results also indicate that exposure to a prolonged dark period has an important negative influence on the chlorophyll a/b ratio, suggesting that lichens could be profitably used not only to monitor climate changes, but also to monitor the effects of global dimming. © 2007 Società Botanica Italiana.","Cell membranes; Global dimming; Global warming; Heat stress; Photosynthetic pigments","Evernia prunastri",,,,,,"Awasthi, D.D., Agrawal, M.R., An enumeration of lichens from the tropical and subtropical regions of Darjeeling District, India (1970) J Ind Bot Soc, 49, pp. 122-136; Barnes, J.D., Balaguer, L., Manrique, E., Elvira, S., Davison, A.W., A reappraisal of the use of DMSO for the extraction and determination of chlorophylls a and b in lichens and higher plants (1992) Env Exp Bot, 32, pp. 85-100; Bjerke, J.A., Zielke, M., Solheim, B., Long-term impacts of simulated climatic change on secondary metabolism, thallus structure and nitrogen fixation activity in two cyanolichens from the Arctic (2003) New Phytol, 159, pp. 361-367; Brown, D.H., Hooker, T.N., The significance of acidic lichen substances in the estimation of chlorophyll and phaeophytin in lichens (1977) New Phytol, 78, pp. 617-624; Buck, G.W., Brown, D.H., The effect of desiccation on cation location in lichens (1979) Ann Bot, 44, pp. 265-277; Culberson, C.F., Culberson, W.L., Johnson, A., Thermally induced chemical artifacts in lichens (1977) Phytochemistry, 16, pp. 127-130; Demmig-Adams, B., Maguas, C., Adams III, W.W., Meyer, A., Kilian, E., Lange, O.L., Effect of high light on the efficiency of photochemical energy conversion in a variety of lichen species with green and blue-green phycobionts (1990) Planta, 180, pp. 400-409; Esseen, P.-A., Renhorn, K.-E., Edge effects on an epiphytic lichen in fragmented forests (1998) Conserv Biol, 12, pp. 1307-1317; Galun, M., (1988) Handbook of lichenology, 2. , CRC Press: Boca Raton, Florida; Gauslaa, Y., Solhaug, K.A., Differences in the susceptibility to light stress between epiphytic lichens of ancient and young boreal forest stands (1996) Funct Ecol, 10, pp. 344-354; Gauslaa, Y., Solhaug, K.A., High-light damage in air dried thalli of the old forest lichen Lobaria pulmonaria-interactions of irradiance, exposure duration and high temperature (1999) J Exp Bot, 50, pp. 697-705; Houghton, J.T., Ding, Y., Griggs, D.J., Nouger, M., van der Linden, P.J., Dai, X., (2001) Contribution of Working Group I to the Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, , Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis, Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press; Howarth, C.J., Pollock, C.J., Peakock, J.M., Development of a laboratory-based method for assessing seedling thermotolerance in pearl millet (1997) New Phytol, 137, pp. 129-139; Insarov, G., Insarova, I., Assessment of lichen sensitivity to climate change (1996) Israel J Plant Sci, 44, pp. 309-334; Insarov, G., Schroeter, B., Lichen monitoring and climate change (2002) Monitoring with lichens-monitoring lichens, pp. 183-201. , Nimis PL, Scheidegger C, Wolseley PA, editors, The Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Publishers. pp; Insarov, G., Semenov, S., Insarova, I., A system to monitor climate change with epilithic lichens (1999) Env Monit Assess, 55, pp. 279-298; Kappen, L., Response to extreme environments (1973) The lichens, pp. 311-380. , Ahmadjian V, Hale ME, editors, London, New York & San Francisco: Academic Press. pp; Kershaw, K.A., (1985) Physiological ecology of lichens, 220. , Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, UK; Lange, O.L., Hitze-und Trockenresistenz der Flechten in Beziehung zu ihrer Verbreitung (1953) Flora (Jena), 140, pp. 39-97; Liu, Y., Cao, T., Glime, J.M., The changes of membrane permeability of mosses under high temperature stress (2003) Bryologist, 106, pp. 53-60; Marques, A.P., Freitas, M.C., Wolterbeek, H.T., Steinebach, O.M., Verburg, T., De Goeij, J.J.M., Cell-membrane damage and element leaching in transplanted Parmelia sulcata lichen related to ambient SO2, temperature, and precipitation (2005) Env Sci Technol, 39, pp. 2624-2630; MacFarlane, J.D., Kershaw, K.A., Thermal sensitivity in lichens (1978) Science, 201, pp. 739-741; MacFarlane, J.D., Kershaw, K.A., Physiological-environmental interactions in lichens.
