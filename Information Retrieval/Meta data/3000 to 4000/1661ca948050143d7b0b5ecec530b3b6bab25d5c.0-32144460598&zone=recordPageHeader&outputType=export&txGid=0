Evidences have shown that global warming has accelerated over the past 20 a and the 1990s was the warmest decade in the instrumental records since 1861. Trends of various clouds amounts over this period are analyzed by employing the linear regression method. The results show that global mean total cloud amounts, in general, have tended to reduce over the past 20 a. But there are slightly increasing by about 2% before 1987 and decreasing by about 4% since then. Cloudiness trends of both low and high clouds decrease while increase for the middle cloud. And there exist remarkable discrepancies in different regions. The preliminary analyses suggest that it is likely that the cloud change occurring over the past 20 a is a positive feedback to global warming.","Cloud amount; Global warming; ISCCP; Trend of cloud",,,,,,,"Angell, J.K., Variation in United States cloudiness and sunshine duration between 1950 and the drought year of 1988 (1990) J.
