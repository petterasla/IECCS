This is because of the slowness of effective policy developments in the wake of lack of real public support and commitments which has increased pessimism in relation to: prospects for raising the efficiency of energy use quickly; prospects for expanding renewable energy resource utilization quickly; and curbing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change. Further discussions on these issues are presented.",,"Climate change; Economics; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Societies and institutions; Climate convention; European community; Renewable energy resources",,,,,,,"Jefferson, J.M.; World Energy Council, London, United Kingdom","Sayigh A.A.M.",,"Elsevier Sci Ltd, Exeter, United Kingdom","Proceedings of the 1998 World Renewable Energy Congress V.
