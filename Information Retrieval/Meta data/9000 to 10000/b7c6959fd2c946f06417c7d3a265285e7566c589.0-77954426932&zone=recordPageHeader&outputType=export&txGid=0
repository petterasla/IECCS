A decision support system (DSS) has been developed to quantify inputs, outputs and balance of N in soil; GHG emission and REN with the prominent N management technologies in rice. This DSS, named InfoNitro (Information on Nitrogen Management Technologies in Rice), integrated analytical and expert knowledge with databases on bio-physical, agronomic and socio-economical features to establish input-output relationships related to N management in rice. Sixteen technologies, which differed in terms of water regime, method of N application, forms of N and tools of fertilizer recommendation were analysed for their REN, N losses, GHG emission and economic return in Haryana, a rice growing region in India. In the current farmers' practice, REN was 32.7%, which increased up to 40.8% with various technologies except in mid-season drainage and alternate flooding technologies where it decreased up to 29.3%. Loss of N through leaching, volatilization and denitrification in the farmers' practice (67.5 kg N ha-1) decreased up to 40.5 kg N ha-1 except in mid-season drainage and alternate flooding technologies where it increased. The technologies also reduced global warming potential (GWP) by 1 to 9%. However, the technologies except no tillage, mid-season drying and alternate flooding reduced the net income of the farmers. When the environmental cost (cost of N loss and GWP) was included net income with various technologies was either at par or more than the farmers' practice. The marginal abatement cost of N loss was Rs.8 to 134 kg-1 N and for GWP was Rs.766 to 4854 Mg-1 CO2 eq. Resource conserving technology was the most cost effective strategy to reduce N loss and GHG emission whereas integrated N management cost high for mitigating GHG emission. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Conservation agriculture; Global warming potential; Marginal abatement cost; Net return; Recovery efficiency of N","abatement cost; agricultural management; agronomy; carbon emission; conservation management; cost-benefit analysis; decision support system; denitrification; drainage network; fertilizer application; flooding; global warming; greenhouse gas; household income; leaching; mitigation; nitrogen; resource management; rice; volatilization; zero tillage; Haryana; India",,,,,,"Aggarwal, P.K., Sujith, K., Vashisth, A.K., Hoanh, C.T., van Keulen, H., Kalra, N., Pathak, H., Roetter, R.P., Balancing food demand (2001) Land use analysis and planning for sustainable food security: With an illustration for the state of Haryana, India, pp. 33-60. , In: Aggarwal PK, Roetter RP, Kalra N, van Keulen H, Hoanh CT, van Laar HH (eds),Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi; International Rice Research Institute, Los Banos; Wagningen University and Research Center, Wagningen; Aulakh, M.S., Khera, T.S., Doran, J.W., Bronson, K.F., Denitrification, N2O and CO2 fluxes in rice-wheat cropping system as affected by crop residues, fertilizer N and legume green manure (2001) Biol Fertil Soils, 34, pp. 375-389; Banerjee, B., Pathak, H., Aggarwal, P.K., Effects of dicyandiamide, farmyard manure and irrigation on ammonia volatilization from an alluvial soil in rice (Oryza sativa L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cropping system (2002) Biol Fertil Soils, 36, pp. 207-214; Bijay-Singh, F., Bronson, K.F., Yadvinder-Singh, K., Khera, T.S., Pasuquin, E., Nitrogen-15 balance as affected by rice-straw management in a rice-wheat rotation in northwest India (2001) Nutr Cycl Agroecosyst, 59, pp. 227-237; Bijay-Singh, F., Gajri, P.R., Timsina, J., Yadvinder-Singh, K., Dhillon, S.S., Some issues on water and nitrogen dynamics in rice-wheat sequences on flats and beds in the Indo-Gangetic plains (2002) Modelling irrigated cropping systems, with special attention to rice-wheat sequences and raised bed planting, CSIRO Land and Water Tech, pp. 1-15. , In: Humphreys E, Timsina J (eds),Report 25/02.
