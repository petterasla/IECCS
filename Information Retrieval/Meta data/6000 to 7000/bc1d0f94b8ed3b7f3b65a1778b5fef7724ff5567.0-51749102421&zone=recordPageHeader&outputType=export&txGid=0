This article provides an environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) of a typical commercial office building in Thailand. Almost all commercial office buildings in Thailand follow a similar structural, envelope pattern as well as usage patterns. Likewise, almost every office building in Thailand operates on electricity, which is obtained from the national grid which limits variability. Therefore, the results of the single case study building are representative of commercial office buildings in Thailand. Target audiences are architects, building construction managers and environmental policy makers who are interested in the environmental impact of buildings. Materials and methods: In this work, a combination of input-output and process analysis was used in assessing the potential environmental impact associated with the system under study according to the ISO14040 methodology. The study covered the whole life cycle including material production, construction, occupation, maintenance, demolition, and disposal. The inventory data was simulated in an LCA model and the environmental impacts for each stage computed. Three environmental impact categories considered relevant to the Thailand context were evaluated, namely, global warming potential, acidification potential, and photo-oxidant formation potential. A 50-year service time was assumed for the building. Results: The results obtained showed that steel and concrete are the most significant materials both in terms of quantities used, and also for their associated environmental impacts at the manufacturing stage. They accounted for 24% and 47% of the global warming potential, respectively. In addition, of the total photo-oxidant formation potential, they accounted for approximately 41% and 30%; and, of the total acidification potential, 37% and 42%, respectively. Analysis also revealed that the life cycle environmental impacts of commercial buildings are dominated by the operation stage, which accounted for approximately 52% of the total global warming potential, about 66% of the total acidification potential, and about 71% of the total photo-oxidant formation potential, respectively. The results indicate that the principal contributor to the impact categories during the operation phase were emissions related to fossil fuel combustion, particularly for electricity production. Discussion: The life cycle environmental impacts of commercial buildings are dominated by the operation stage, especially electricity consumption. Significant reductions in the environmental impacts of buildings at this stage can be achieved through reducing their operating energy. The results obtained show that increasing the indoor set-point temperature of the building by 2°C, as well as the practice of load shedding, reduces the environmental burdens of buildings at the operation stage. On a national scale, the implementation of these simple no-cost energy conservation measures have the potential to achieve estimated reductions of 10.2% global warming potential, 5.3% acidification potential, and 0.21% photo-oxidant formation potential per year, respectively, in emissions from the power generation sector. Overall, the measures could reduce approximately 4% per year from the projected global warming potential of 211.51 Tg for the economy of Thailand. Conclusions: Operation phase has the highest energy and environmental impacts, followed by the manufacturing phase. At the operation phase, significant reductions in the energy consumption and environmental impacts can be achieved through the implementation of simple no-cost energy conservation as well as energy efficiency strategies. No-cost energy conservation policies, which minimize energy consumption in commercial buildings, should be encouraged in combination with already existing energy efficiency measures of the government. Recommendations and perspectives: In the long run, the environmental impacts of buildings will need to be addressed. Incorporation of environmental life cycle assessment into the current building code is proposed. It is difficult to conduct a full and rigorous life cycle assessment of an office building. A building consists of many materials and components. This study made an effort to access reliable data on all the life cycle stages considered. Nevertheless, there were a number of assumptions made in the study due to the unavailability of adequate data. In order for life cycle modeling to fulfill its potential, there is a need for detailed data on specific building systems and components in Thailand. This will enable designers to construct and customize LCAs during the design phase to enable the evaluation of performance and material tradeoffs across life cycles without the excessive burden of compiling an inventory. Further studies with more detailed, reliable, and Thailand-specific inventories for building materials are recommended. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Embodied energy; Environmental impact; Life cycle assessment; Office building; Primary energy consumption; Thailand","fossil fuel; acidification; article; building; building material; combustion; cost; economic aspect; energy conservation; greenhouse effect; hospital service; life cycle; methodology; occupation; photooxidation; priority journal; reliability; temperature; Thailand; work environment",,,,,,"Abeysundra, U.G.Y., Babel, S., Gheewala, S.H., A decision making matrix with life cycle perspective of materials for roofs in Sri Lanka (2007) Mater des, 28, pp. 2478-2487. , 9; Adalberth, K., Energy use during the life cycle of buildings: A method (1997) Build Environ, 32, pp. 317-320. , 4; Adalberth, K., Energy use during the life cycle of single unit dwellings: Examples (1997) Build Environ, 32, pp. 321-329. , 4; (2004) ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55-2004 Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy, 26p. , ASHRAE Atlanta GA, American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-conditioning Engineers Inc, (Accessed, 31 March 2007); Aun, C.S., Energy efficiency: Designing low energy buildings using energy 10 (2004) Pertubuhan Arkitek Malaysia CPD Seminar 7th August 2004, , http://www.pam.org.my/Library/cpd_notes/Energy-Efficiency.pdf, (accessed March 2006); Ayuni, M., (2004) Promotion of Energy Efficiency and Conservation, , http://www.aseanenergy.org/download/projects/promeec/2004-2005/inception/ indonesia/promeec-bali24-25agustus%202004%20(new%20versionke-2).ppt, (accessed March 2006); Baldo, G.L., Rollino, S., Stimmeder, G., Fieschi, M., The use of LCA to develop eco-label criteria for hard floor coverings on behalf of the European flower (2002) Int J Life Cycle Assess, 7, pp. 269-275. , 5; (2005) Construction Permission by Type, , http://www.bma.go.th, (Jan 1988 to Aug 2005), (accessed April 2006); Beatriz, R., Almudena, H., Teresa, M., Gumersindo, F., Life cycle inventory of particleboard: A case study in the wood sector (2006) Int J Life Cycle Assess, 11, pp. 106-113. , 2; Buchanan, A.H., Levine, S.B., Wood based building materials and atmospheric carbon emissions (2000) Environ Sci Policy, 2, pp. 427-437; Bullard, C., Herendeen, R., The energy cost of goods and services (1975) Energy Policy, 3, pp. 268-278. , 4; (2000) Designing with Vision: A Technical Manual for Materials Choices in Sustainable Construction.
