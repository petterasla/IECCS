Krasser has a disjunct and narrow distribution in south-eastern Australian cool temperate rainforest. To assess the conservation-genetic priorities for this species, the genetic diversity of 20 populations sampled from the largest remnant patches at northern and southern distributional extremes, the McPherson and Barrington ranges (a total of 146 individuals), was investigated by using inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR). Regeneration in northern regions of N. moorei has been documented to be predominantly by vegetative means, but our results indicate little evidence of clonality outside the multi-stemmed rings of trees. In addition, genetic diversity was considerably higher in the northern (McPherson, h = 0.1613) than in the southern range (Barrington, h = 0.1159), and genetic differentiation was significantly positively correlated with geographic distance in the former region, but not the latter. Total intraspecific variation was moderate, as measured by Shannon's diversity index, I = 0.2719, and Nei's gene diversity, h = 0.1672, and is considered at the high end of spectrum for estimates of narrow endemic species. An analysis of molecular variation indicated that the majority of genetic variation is partitioned among individuals within population (60%; P < 0.001), rather than among populations within regions (10%; P < 0.001). However, a large and significant component of the measured diversity was partitioned between northern and southern regions (29%; P < 0.001). Several hypotheses are outlined to explain these differences and management implications are discussed. However, given the narrow range, poor dispersal mechanism and restriction to cool temperate rainforest, the continued existence of N. moorei is most threatened by environmental instability and habitat loss resulting from global climate change. In this context the northern regions of the species are most at risk and extinction of such populations would lead to a significant loss of genetic variation for the species as a whole. © CSIRO 2005.",,"conservation genetics; conservation status; genetic variation; rainforest; Australasia; Australia; Eastern Hemisphere; World; Nothofagus moorei",,,,,,"Bale, C.L., Williams, J.B., Composition and classification of Nothofagus moorei communities in northern NSW (1993) Australian Systematic Botany, 6, pp. 429-440; Carpenter, R.J., Hill, R.S., Greenwood, D.R., Partridge, A.D., Banks, M.A., No snow in the mountains: Early Eocene plant fossils from Hotham Heights, Victoria, Australia (2004) Australian Journal of Botany, 52, pp. 685-718. , doi: 10.1071/BT04032; Dettmann, M.E., Pocknall, D.T., Romero, E.J., Zamaloa, M., Nothofagidites Erdtman ex Potonie, 1960; a catalogue of species with notes on the paleogeographic distribution of Nothofagus (southern beech) (1990) New Zealand Geological Survey Paleontological Bulletin, 60, pp. 1-79; Esselman, E.J., Jianqiang, L., Crawford, D.J., Winduss, J.L., Wolfe, A.D., Clonal diversity in the rare Calamagrostis porteri ssp. insperata (Poaceae): Comparative results for allozymes and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers (1999) Molecular Ecology, 8, pp. 443-451. , doi: 10.1046/j.1365-294X.1999.00585.x; Floyd, A.G., (1990) Australian Rainforests in New South Wales - Vols 1 and 2, 1-2. , Surrey Beatty: Sydney; Hamrick, J.L., Godt, M.J.W., Sherman-Broyles, S.L., Factors influencing levels of genetic diversity in woody plant species (1992) New Forests, 6, pp. 95-124. , doi: 10.1007/BF00120641; Hewitt, G., The genetic legacy of the Quaternanry ice ages (2000) Nature, 405, pp. 907-913. , doi: 10.1038/35016000; Hill, R.S., Nothofagus: Evolution from a southern perspective (1992) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 7, pp. 190-194. , doi: 10.1016/0169-5347(92)90071-I; Hill, R.S., Biogeography, evolution and palaeoecology of Nothofagus (Nothofagaceae): The contribution of fossil record (2001) Australian Journal of Botany, 49, pp. 321-332. , doi: 10.1071/BT00026; Hill, R.S., Dettmann, M.E., Origin and diversification of the genus Nothofagus (1996) The Ecology and Biogeography of Nothofagus Forests, pp. 11-24. , Eds T Veblen, RS Hill, J Read Yale University Press: London; Howard, T.M., Southern closed forests (1981) Australian Vegetation, pp. 102-120. , Ed.
