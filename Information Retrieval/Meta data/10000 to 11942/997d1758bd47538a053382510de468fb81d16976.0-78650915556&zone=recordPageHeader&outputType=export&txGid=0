The important area of electric lighting, currently dominated by decades-old incandescent and fluorescent sources, is being taken over by white light emitting diodes, which are solid state devices with much greater energy savings. Replacement of current inefficient lighting by these LEDs will result in reduction of global carbon dioxide emissions, a major cause of global warming, among other things. WLEDs hold the potential, in the field of photonics, to be as transformational as the transistor was in electronics. This core device has the potential to revolutionize how we use light, including not only for illumination, but also for communications, sensing, navigation, imaging, and many more applications. In this tutorial we highlight some of the potentials. © 2006 IEEE.",,"Carbon dioxide emissions; Energy saving; Sustainable energy; White light emitting diodes; Wireless application; Carbon dioxide; Electric lighting; Energy conservation; Global warming; Light emitting diodes; Wireless telecommunication systems; Solid state devices",,,,,,"Gfeller, F., Bapst, U., Wireless in-house data communication via diffuse infrared radiation (1979) Proc.
