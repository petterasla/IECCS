But it is clear that the North will vote only limited funds to facilitate the working of the Conventions, perhaps US$2 billion over the coming three years. Against the scale of the problems this is an inadequate sum. However, there are opportunities for tapping into other sources of funds, and for using official transfers as a lever for yet other funds. Additionally, enormous scope exists for reducing global environmental problems through the adoption of more sensible economic policies. The deployment of imaginative policies to 'capture' environmental value can make a substantial difference to the global environment. © 1995.",,"economic policy; environmental economics; financial provision; global change",,,,,,"J Stevens, The Economics of Collective Choice, Westview Press, BoulderGarret Hardin's ‘tragedy of the commons’ confused open access and common property.

Biological diversity is a private good in so far as its uses are competitive (eg ecotourism versus local and international hunting), and a public good in so far as it generates some kind of ‘primary value’ upon which other values depend; Garret Hardin's ‘tragedy of the commons’ confused open access and common property. The ‘tragedy’ of mutual overuse and destruction relates to open access not common propertyAn example of a primary value would be the link between diversity and ecological stability — C P Perrings and D W Pearce, ‘Biodiversity conservation and economic development’, in C Perrings et al (eds), Biodiversity Loss: Ecological and Economic Issues, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, forthcoming. Note that an attempt to get a similar convention on conserving the world's forests was not successful at Rio. In contrast, a convention on desertification — interpreted as dryland degradation — has been negotiated (1994)OECD, (1991) OECD Environmental Data: Compendium 1991, , OECD, Paris; Indeed, the USA did not originally sign the Biodiversity Convention for this reason, and other countries, notably the United Kingdom, also had qualms about signing.
