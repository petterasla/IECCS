As a result, more environmentally benign alternative ABAs are being sought by the foam-blowing industry. This study examined the life cycle of HCFC-22, hydrofluorocarbon-134a (HFC-134a), and cyclopentane, which are currently used or considered as potential alternative ABAs in the manufacture of rigid polyurethane foams that serve as insulation in a model North American refrigerator. The raw material extraction/ refining, manufacturing, use, and disposal stages of the life cycle of each ABA were considered, and their resulting relative impacts on ozone depletion and global warming were compared. The manufacturing, use, and disposal stages were determined to affect ozone depletion and global warming to the largest extent, emphasizing the need for a greater focus on pollution prevention opportunities in these stages. The HFC-134a life cycle yields no impact on ozone depletion and a significantly decreased global warming impact compared with its predecessor, HCFC-22, and a tradeoff of slightly higher global warming impact and fewer added safety concerns compared with its more flammable counterpart, cyclopentane.",,"Environmental protection; Global warming; Ozone; Polyurethanes; Refrigerators; Auxiliary blowing agents (ABA); Air pollution; chlorofluorohydrocarbon; cyclopentane; fluorinated hydrocarbon; norflurane; ozone; polyurethan; article; environmental impact; foam; greenhouse effect; life cycle; pollution; priority journal; refrigerator; Psidium guajava",,"cyclopentane, 287-92-3; norflurane, 811-97-2; ozone, 10028-15-6; polyurethan, 61789-63-7",,,,"(2000) Polyurethane End Use Markets U.S. and Canada 1998 and Projected 2000, , http://www.polyurethane.org/; (1991) Handbook for Reducing and Eliminating Chlorofluorocarbons in Flexible Polyurethane Foams, , 21A-4002; Office of Air and Radiation: Washington, DC; (1996) Best Management Practices for Pollution Prevention in the Slabstock and Molded Flexible Polyurethane Foam Industry, , EPA/625/R-96/005; Office of Research and Development: Cincinnati, OH; Woods, G., (1987) The ICI Polyurethanes Book, , Wiley & Sons, Inc.: New York; Molina, M.J., Rowland, F.S., Stratospheric sink for chlorofluoromethanes: Chlorine atom-catalysed destruction of ozone (1974) Nature, 249, pp. 810-812; Protection of stratospheric ozone; listing of substitutes in the foam sector, final rule; 40 CFR part 82 (2002) Fed.
