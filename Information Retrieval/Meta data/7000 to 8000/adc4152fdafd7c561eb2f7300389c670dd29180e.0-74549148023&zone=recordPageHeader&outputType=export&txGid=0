Olive (Olea europaea) is of eco-social importance in the Mediterranean where it was domesticated. This drought-resistant crop and its major pest, the olive fly (Bactrocera oleae), have tight biological links that make them a suitable model system for climate change studies in the Mediterranean. Here a physiologically based weather-driven demographic model of olive and olive fly is used to analyze in detail this plant-pest system in Sardinia under observed weather (10 years of daily data from 48 locations), three climate warming scenarios (increases of 1, 2 and 3 °C in average daily temperature), and a 105-year climate model scenario for the Alghero location (e.g. 1951-2055). GRASS GIS is used to map model predictions of olive bloom dates and yield, total season-long olive fly pupae, and percent fruit attacked by the fly. Island wide simulation data are summarized using multivariate regression. Model calibration with field bloom date data were performed to increase simulation accuracy of olive flowering predictions under climate change. As climate warms, the range of olive is predicted to expand to higher altitudes and consolidate elsewhere, especially in coastal areas. The range of olive fly will extend into previously unfavorable cold areas, but will contract in warm inland lowlands where temperatures approach its upper thermal limits. Consequently, many areas of current high risk are predicted to have decreased risk of fly damage with climate warming. Simulation using a 105-year climate model scenario for Alghero, Sardinia predicts changes in the olive-olive fly system expected to occur if climate continued to warm at the low rate observed during in the past half century. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Agroecosystem analysis; Climate change; GIS; Mediterranean basin; Multitrophic interactions; Olive; Olive fly; Physiologically based models; Population ecology; Sardinia","accuracy assessment; calibration; computer simulation; crop plant; fly; GIS; global warming; multiple regression; multivariate analysis; numerical model; physiology; population ecology; tritrophic interaction; Alghero; Italy; Mediterranean Sea; Sardinia; Sassari; Bactrocera oleae; Olea europaea",,,,,,"Araujo, M.B., Luoto, M., The importance of biotic interactions for modelling species distributions under climate change (2007) Global Ecology and Biogeography, 16, pp. 743-753; Besnard, G., Casas, R.R.D., Vargas, P., Plastid and nuclear DNA polymorphism reveals historical processes of isolation and reticulation in the olive tree complex (Olea europaea) (2007) Journal of Biogeography, 34, pp. 736-752; Bongi, G., Freezing avoidance in olive tree (Olea europaea L.): from proxies to targets of action (2002) Advances in Horticultural Science, 16, pp. 117-124; Chessa, P.A., Delitala, A.M.S., Objective analysis of daily extreme temperatures of Sardinia (Italy) using distance from the sea as independent variable (1997) International Journal of Climatology, 17, pp. 1467-1485; (2004) Void-filled seamless SRTM data V1, , http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org, CIAT Available at (accessed March 30, 2006); Cossu, A., Battaglini, A., Bindi, M., Cambiamenti climatici e caratteristiche produttive di un'area ad alta vocazione viticola in Sardegna (2004) Informatore Agrario, 60, pp. 85-88; Cossu, Q.A., Bodini, A., (2007) Tendenza degli eventi estremi di pioggia in Sardegna: analisi di un'area critica per gli eventi alluvionali, , 101 Convegno nazionale di agrometeorologia - AIAM 2007 Crotone, 29-30 maggio 2007; Davis, A.J., Jenkinson, L.S., Lawton, J.H., Shorrocks, B., Wood, S., Making mistakes when predicting shifts in species range in response to global warming (1998) Nature, 391, pp. 783-786; Deutsch, C.A., Tewksbury, J.J., Huey, R.B., Sheldon, K.S., Ghalambor, C.K., Haak, D.C., Martin, P.R., Impacts of climate warming on terrestrial ectotherms across latitude (2008) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, 105, pp. 6668-6672; Diffenbaugh, N.S., Pal, J.S., Giorgi, F., Gao, X., Heat stress intensification in the Mediterranean climate change hotspot (2007) Geophysical Research Letters, 34, pp. L11706. , doi: 10.1029/2007 GL030000; (2000) Corine land cover 2000, , http://terrestrial.eionet.europa.eu/CLC2000, European Environment Agency (EEA) Available at (accessed September 1, 2006); (2008) Impacts of Europe's changing climate: 2008 indicator-based assessment, p. 246. , European Environment Agency EEA Report No 4/2008.
