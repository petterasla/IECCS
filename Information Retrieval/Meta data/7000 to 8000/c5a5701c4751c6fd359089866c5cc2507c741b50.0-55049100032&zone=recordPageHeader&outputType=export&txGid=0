Determining the relative importance and magnitude of uncertainty of NPP model inputs is important for proper carbon reporting over larger areas and time periods. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of the boreal ecosystem productivity simulator (BEPS) model in mountainous terrain using an established montane forest test site in Kananaskis, Alberta, in the Canadian Rocky Mountains. Model runs were based on forest (land cover, leaf area index (LAI), biomass) and climate-water inputs (solar radiation, temperature, precipitation, humidity, soil water holding capacity) derived from digital elevation model (DEM) derivatives, climate data, geographical information system (GIS) functions, and topographically corrected satellite imagery. Four sensitivity analyses were conducted as a controlled series of experiments involving (i) NPP individual parameter sensitivity for a full growing season, (ii) NPP independent variation tests (parameter μ ± 1σ), (iii) factorial analyses to assess more complex multiple-factor interactions, and (iv) topographic correction. The results, validated against field measurements, showed that modeled NPP was sensitive to most inputs measured in the study area, with LAI and forest type the most important forest input, and solar radiation the most important climate input. Soil available water holding capacity expressed as a function of wetness index was only significant in conjunction with precipitation when both parameters represented a moisture-deficit situation. NPP uncertainty resulting from topographic influence was equivalent to 140 kg C ha-1 year -1. This suggested that topographic correction of model inputs is important for accurate NPP estimation. The BEPS model, designed originally for flat boreal forests, was shown to be applicable in mountainous terrain given appropriate image terrain corrections using the SCS+C approach. Rocky Mountain carbon dynamics were simulated with average annual NPP of Kananaskis forests estimated at 4.01 t C ha-1 year-1 and compared favourably with the field plot estimate of 4.24 t C ha-1 year-1 for this area.",,"Biomass; Carbon; Climate change; Climatology; Electromagnetic waves; Forestry; Geomorphology; Landforms; Models; Moisture; Photosynthesis; Probability density function; Remote sensing; Renewable energy resources; Satellite imagery; Sensitivity analysis; Soil moisture; Soil testing; Soils; Solar radiation; Solar system; Space optics; Sun; Surface properties; Surveying; Underwater soils; Watersheds; A carbons; Accurate; Alberta; Available water holding capacities; Biophysical parameters; Boreal ecosystems; Boreal forests; Canadian rocky mountains; Carbon dynamics; Climate datum; Digital Elevation models; Factorial analyses; Field measurements; Forest managements; Forest types; Geographical information systems; Global climate changes; Growing seasons; Key components; Land covers; Leaf area indexes; Model inputs; Montane forests; Mountainous terrains; Net Primary productivities; Parameter sensitivities; Productivity models; Relative importances; Rocky mountains; Soil water holdings; Study areas; Systematic evaluations; Terrain corrections; Terrestrial carbon cycles; Time periods; Topographic corrections; Geologic models; Biomass; Carbon; Ecosystems; Mathematical Models; Meteorology; Moisture Content; Optical Measurement; Productivity; Satellites; Soil; Sun Light",,,,,,"Amthor, J.S., Chen, J.M., Clein, J.S., Frolking, S.E., Goulden, M.L., Grant, R.F., Kimball, J.S., Wofsy, S.C., Boreal forest CO2 exchange and evapotranspiration predicted by nine ecosystem process models: Intermodel comparisons and relationships to field measurements (2001) Journal of Geophysical Research, 106, pp. 33-623. , 33 648; Archibald, J.H., Klappstein, G.D., and Corns, I.G.W. 1996.
