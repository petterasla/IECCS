The authors suggest international carbon-emission offsets (ICEOs) as a means by which international markets, under a policy umbrella such as a multilateral climate-protection treaty, could trade carbon-saving services. Such a market would provide a currency for rewarding actions that reduce global carbon emissions, allowing carbon emitters to seek the least expensive ways to reduce emissions. This currency would transfer cash and/or debt relief from industrialized nations to developing nations, allowing the developing nations to profit from the use of clean energy technologies and the protection, rather than depletion, of tropical forests. -from Authors",,"carbon dioxide emissions; climate protection; environmental services market",,,,,,,,"Myers N.",,"Kluwer",,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027062588
