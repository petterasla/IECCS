This is essential for implementing carbon crediting programs for ameliorating the effects of global warming. Although none of the developed models was powerful in predicting SOC, a stepwise regression model was selected since it provided the lowest validation root mean square error (RMSE) of 10.4metric tons per hectare (ton/ha). Using this model, a SOC map for the basin was constructed by applying map algebra. The total SOC content to 0.2 m depth of the basin was calculated to be 9,423,986.4 metric tons with SOC density of26.3 ton/ha. This study suggested that, in semi-arid environments and using the statistical modeling techniques that were tested, TM-based SOC models cannot be used for implementing carbon crediting programs; however, they can estimate total surface SOC pools in large areas to within a few percent error. © 2011 American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.",,"Developed model; Map algebra; Natural surface; Root mean square errors; Semi-arid environments; Soil organic carbon; Statistical modeling; Stepwise regression; Thematic mappers; Global warming; Lakes; Regression analysis; Soil testing; Surface testing; Organic carbon; data set; emissions trading; error analysis; global warming; incentive; numerical model; organic soil; regression analysis; semiarid region; soil carbon; soil organic matter; thematic mapping; Jordan; Zarqa Basin",,,,,,"Agbu, P.A., Fehrenbacher, D.J., Jansen, I.J., Soil property relationships with SPOT satellite digital data in east centralIllinois (1990) Soil Science Society of America Journal, 54, pp. 807-812; (2006) Esri, Inc, , ArcMap, Esri ArcMap® 9.2; Blake, G.R., Hartge, K.H., (1986) Bulk Density, Methods of Soil Analysis: Part 1, pp. 363-375. , (A.
