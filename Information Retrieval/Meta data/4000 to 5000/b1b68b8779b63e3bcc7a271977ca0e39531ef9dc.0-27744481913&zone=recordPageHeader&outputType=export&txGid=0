The LCA method has been used to assess the environmental impact of various products from domestic articles like plastic trays to large buildings. However, few LCA studies on domestic lumber have been conducted because of regional and other differences in forestry methods, distribution, etc. In this study, to obtain basic knowledge on the environmental impact of sugi lumber products, we investigated energy consumption, amount of waste, and volume of product in processes from felling to sawmilling. From the obtained data, emissions of environmental load substances were quantified and evaluated by LCA. The main results obtained are as follow: CO 2, CO, NOx, and SO 2 were emitted in large quantities from the sawmill subprocess. This is probably due to the large electricity consumption of sawmill equipment. The amount of CO 2 emissions depends on the yield of the sawmill and the distance from market of the sawmill. Therefore, effective means to reduce the CO 2 emissions were suggested as follow: the sawmill equipment can be rationalized to improve the yield in sawmill subprocess, and the sawmilling line can be made more highly effective; in addition, it is important to plan construction of sawmills so that the distance from the sawmill to the market will be shortest. Global warming and acidification comprise almost the entire result of the impact assessment of both sawmills. The substances that contributed to global warming and acidification were CO 2, NOx, SO 2, and CH 4, and each substance was emitted most in the sawmill subprocess. Overall, this study showed that the sawmill subprocess has the greatest role in the environmental load of lumber products.",,"Cryptomeria japonica",,,,,,"(2003) LCA Guidance of Buildings, 2 nd Ed., , Architectural Institute of Japan publication, Tokyo; (2002) Forest and Forestry, 575, pp. 4-13. , Japan; (2003) Forest and Forestry, 589, pp. 4-12. , Japan; (2004) Wood Industry Handbook, 4 th Ed., , Maruzen publication, Tokyo; Hiroshima Prefecture Forestry Guild Association Q&A about Wood, , http://www.mokuren.org/mori/index_3.htm; (1999) Introduction to LCA Practical Business, 2 nd Ed., , Japan Environmental Management For Industry publication, Tokyo; Jönsson, Å., Tillman, A.-M., Svensson, T., Life Cycle Assessment of Flooring Materials: Case (1997) Building and Environment, 32 (3), pp. 245-255; Klvac, R., Ward, S., Owende, P.M.O., Lyons, J., (2003) Scandinavian Journal of Forest Research, 18, pp. 176-183; Kurayoshi, I., Terashima, Y., (1992) Japan Society of Waste Management Experts 3 rd Annual Conference Proceedings, pp. 43-46; (1998) All of LCA, 3 rd Ed., , Kogyo Chosakai publication, Tokyo; (2005) Forestry Practical Business, 3 rd Ed., , Asakura publication, Tokyo","Ohuchi, T.; Division of Biomaterial Science, Department of Forest and Forest Products Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka 812-8581, Japan; email: tohuchi@agr.kyushu-u.ac.jp",,,,,,,,00236152,,,,"English","J.
