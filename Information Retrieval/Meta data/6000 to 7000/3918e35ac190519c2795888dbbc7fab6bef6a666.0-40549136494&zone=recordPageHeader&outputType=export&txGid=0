As a countermeasure, next-generation vehicles for a recycling-based society that are energy-efficient, compact, light, low-cost and reliable need to spread in the society. In this study, we will explain the basic philosophy of how to approach next-generation energy-saving technologies for automobiles, the current status and technological issues of internal combustion engines (ICE), hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), electric vehicles (EVs), and fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) with the latest examples. © 2008 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.
