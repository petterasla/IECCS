They are also likely to be one of the most sensitive components of the terrestrial biosphere to global climate change. An understanding of relationships between wetland persistence and climate is imperative for predicting, mitigating and adapting to the impacts of future climate change on wetland extent and function. We investigated whether mire wetlands had contracted, expanded or remained stable during 1960-2000. We chose a study area encompassing a regional climatic gradient in southeastern Australia, specifically to avoid confounding effects of water extraction on wetland hydrology and extent. We first characterized trends in climate by examining data from local weather stations, which showed a slight increase in precipitation and marked decline in pan evaporation over the relevant period. Remote sensing of vegetation boundaries showed a marked lateral expansion of mires during 1961-1998, and a corresponding contraction of woodland. The spatial patterns in vegetation change were consistent with the regional climatic gradient and showed a weaker co-relationship to fire history. Resource exploitation, wildland fires and autogenic mire development failed to explain the observed expansion of mire vegetation in the absence of climate change. We therefore conclude that the extent of mire wetlands is likely to be sensitive to variation in climatic moisture over decadal time scales. Late 20th-century trends in climatic moisture may be related primarily to reduced irradiance and/or reduced wind speeds. In the 21st century, however, net climatic moisture in this region is projected to decline. As mires are apparently sensitive to hydrological change, we anticipate lateral contraction of mire boundaries in coming decades as projected climatic drying eventuates. This raises concerns about the future hydrological functions, carbon storage capacity and unique biodiversity of these important ecosystems. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Climate change; Evaporation; Global dimming; Greenhouse effect; Hydrological change; Landscape change; Mire wetlands; Peatlands; Remote sensing; Vegetation dynamics","biodiversity; carbon sequestration; climate change; decadal variation; ecosystem response; global change; greenhouse effect; hydrological change; landscape change; peatland; remote sensing; trend analysis; twentieth century; vegetation dynamics; wetland; woodland; Australia",,,,,,"Almquist-Jacobson, H., Foster, D.R., Toward an integrated model for raised-bog development: theory and field evidence (1995) Ecology, 76, pp. 2503-2516; Anderson, R.L., Foster, D.R., Motzkin, G., Integrating lateral expansion into models of peatland development in temperate New England (2003) Journal of Ecology, 91, pp. 68-76; Bond, W.J., van Wilgen, B., (1996) Fire and Plants, , Chapman and Hall, London; Bullock, A., Acreman, M., The role of wetlands in the hydrological cycle (2003) Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 7, pp. 358-389; Clymo, R.S., The limits to peat bog growth (1984) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, 303, pp. 605-654; Crawley, M.J., (1993) GLIM for Ecologists, , Blackwell, Oxford; Ellis, C.J., Tallis, J.H., Climatic control of blanket mire development at Kentra Moss, North-East Scotland (2000) Journal of Ecology, 88, pp. 869-889; Freeman, C., Evans, C.D., Monteith, D.T., Reynolds, B., Fenner, N., Export of organic carbon from peat soils (2001) Nature, 412, p. 785; Freeman, C., Fenner, N., Ostle, N.J., et al, Export of dissolved organic carbon under elevated carbon dioxide levels (2004) Nature, 430, pp. 195-198; Gill, A.M., Catling, P.C., Fire regimes in Australian heathlands and their effects on plants and animals (2002) Flammable Australia: The Fire Regimes and Biodiversity of a Continent, pp. 351-369. , Bradstock RA, Williams JE, Gill AM., Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Gore, A.J.P., (1983) Mires: Swamp, Bog, Fen and Moor.
