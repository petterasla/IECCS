Our analyses of global climate model experiments and observational data reveal that many areas of the globe are likely to permanently move into such a climate space over the next four decades, should greenhouse gas concentrations continue to increase. In contrast to the common perception that high-latitude areas face the most accelerated response to global warming, our results demonstrate that in fact tropical areas exhibit the most immediate and robust emergence of unprecedented heat, with many tropical areas exhibiting a 50% likelihood of permanently moving into a novel seasonal heat regime in the next two decades. We also find that global climate models are able to capture the observed intensification of seasonal hot conditions, increasing confidence in the projection of imminent, permanent emergence of unprecedented heat. © 2011 The Author(s).",,"20th century; Gas concentration; Global climate model; Heat regime; Hot conditions; Human system; Observational data; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Climate models; climate effect; climate modeling; decadal variation; global warming; greenhouse gas; seasonality; twentieth century; twenty first century",,,,,,"Ashfaq, M., Suppression of south Asian summer monsoon precipitation in the 21st century (2009) Geophys Res Lett, 36, p. 1704. , doi:10.1029/2008GL036500; Battisti, D.S., Naylor, R.L., Historical warnings of future food insecurity with unprecedented seasonal heat (2009) Science, 323 (5911), pp. 240-244; Carter, T.R., New assessment methods and the characterisation of future conditions (2007) Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, pp. 133-171. , M.
