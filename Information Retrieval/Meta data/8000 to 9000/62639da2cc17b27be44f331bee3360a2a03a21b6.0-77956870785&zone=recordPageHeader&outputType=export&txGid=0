These multidecadal physical-biological affinities inspired a closer look at AMOC influences on bottom-up control of NA and South Atlantic Ocean (SA) pelagic ecosystem variability. Various ocean models associate changes in the AMOC with sea surface temperature (SST) differences in the western subpolar NA and SA represented as the Atlantic Dipole SST Anomaly (ADSA) index. The Extended Reconstructed SST version 2 (ERSSTv2) dataset for 2° quadrangles from 1890 to 2007 was used here to represent Atlantic Ocean SST patterns and to gauge 20th century AMOC variability using an Atlantic Dipole SST (ADS) index, an un-normalized version of ADSA index. Temperature-phosphate (T-PO4) linear regressions were used to convert temperature to phosphate concentration ([PO4]). The interannual stability of T-PO4 linear regressions first was examined using 26 Bermuda area T-PO4 datasets between 1958 and 2001. Within the constraints provided by the Bermuda analysis, climatological T-PO4 linear regressions based on GEOSECS-derived slopes and NODC-derived X-intercepts supported the conversion of monthly Atlantic Ocean ERSSTv2 temperatures for each 2° quadrangle to monthly surface [PO4]. A representative annual surface phosphate utilization (SPU) was calculated for each 2° quadrangle by subtracting monthly minimum surface [PO4] from monthly maximum surface [PO4] to determine the annual surface [PO4] ranges from 1890 to 2007. Annual average SST tended to increase and overall annual average SPU tended to decrease through the 20th century in both the NA and SA, but the NA exhibited more temporal variability. An Atlantic Dipole Phosphate Utilization (ADPU) index related to the ADS index was calculated for each year from 1890 to 2007. The ADS and ADPU indices were inversely correlated with about 57% of the variability in the ADPU index explained by the ADS index. The ADPU index exhibited three distinct cycles through the 20th century. Cross-correlation analysis showed that the NAO led the ADS and ADPU indices by about 14 years. Differences in annual average SPU for each Atlantic Ocean 2° quadrangle between the three high and four low years of the ADPU cycles yielded six maps that, when averaged, clearly exhibited reversed east-west patterns distributed in alternating latitudinal bands in both the NA and SA. The east-west patterns spatially corresponded to the NA and SA surface circulation and temporally resembled NA patterns previously associated with the NAO. AMOC variability, mediated by Kelvin and Rossby waves associated with changes in both deep and surface arm circulation, likely contributed to meridional continuity of phosphate-classified, NA, and SA pelagic ecosystem variability, including fisheries, through the 20th century. Based on the results, future global warming influences on the AMOC, well short of shutdown, likely will have complex pelagic ecosystem impacts throughout the Atlantic Ocean. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","AMOC; Bipolar; ERSST; Fisheries; Multidecadal; NAO; Nutrient; Thermohaline","AMOC; Bipolar; ERSST; Multidecadal; NAO; Thermohaline; Atmospheric pressure; Atmospheric temperature; Deceleration; Fisheries; Flow of water; Global warming; Linear regression; Nutrients; Ocean currents; Ecosystems; bottom-up control; ecosystem dynamics; fish; meridional circulation; North Atlantic Oscillation; overturn; paleoecology; pelagic ecosystem; phosphate; sea surface temperature; thermohaline circulation; twentieth century; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Atlantic Ocean (South)",,,,,,"Alheit, J., Bakun, A., Population synchronies within and between ocean basins: apparent teleconnections and implications as to physical-biological linkage mechanisms (2010) Journal of Marine Systems, 79, pp. 267-285; Alvarez-Garcia, F., Latif, M., Biastoch, A., On multidecadal and quasi-decadal North Atlantic variability (2008) Journal of Climate, 21, pp. 3433-3452; Antoine, D., Morel, A., Gordon, H.R., Banzon, V.F., Evans, R.H., Bridging ocean color observations of the 1980s and 2000s in search of long-term trends (2005) Journal of Geophysical Research, 110, pp. C06009; Behrenfeld, M.J., O'Malley, R.T., Siegel, D.A., McClain, C.R., Sarmiento, J.L., Feldman, G.C., Milligan, A.J., Boss, E.S., Climate-driven trends in contemporary ocean productivity (2006) Nature, 444, pp. 752-755; Biastoch, A., Boning, C.W., Lutjeharms, J.R.E., Agulhas leakage dynamics affects decadal variability in Atlantic overturning circulation (2008) Nature, 456, pp. 489-492; Bindoff, N.L., Willebrand, J., Artale, V., Cazenave, A., Gregory, J., Gulev, S., Hanawa, K., Unnikrishnan, A., Observations: oceanic climate change and sea level (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis, Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, pp. 385-432. , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, S.
