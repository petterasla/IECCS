Although the popular conception is that geoengineering can re-establish a 'natural' pre-industrial climate, such a scheme would itself inevitably lead to climate change, due to the different temporal and spatial forcing of increased CO<inf>2</inf> compared to reduced solar radiation. We investigate the magnitude and nature of this climate change for the first time within a fully coupled General Circulation Model. We find significant cooling of the tropics, warming of high latitudes and related sea ice reduction, a reduction in intensity of the hydrological cycle, reduced ENSO variability, and an increase in Atlantic overtuming. However, the changes are small relative to those associated with an unmitigated rise in CO<inf>2</inf> emissions. Other problems such as ocean acidification remain unsolved by sunshade geoengineering.
