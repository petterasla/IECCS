Also, it cannot help the environmental specialist to choose the most environmentally sustainable scenario or process, proceeding from the whole life cycle of the object, because it is usually performed only for the use phase of an object. This study also aims to show possibilities for applying LCA methodology, as accepted in the ISO standards series 14040, and as applied to Russian conditions. The main purpose was to investigate a possibility of using the existing environmental impact assessment as the inventory stage in the LCA. As the minor goal, normalisation and weighting factor data for the Russian Federation were calculated on the basis of energy consumption extrapolation. In this paper, the environmental impacts are associated with a sewage wastewater facility. The inventory analysis is performed with data obtained from the MosvodokanalNIIproject (Moscow Research Institute for sewage wastewater treatment facilities) and supplemented with the SimaPro 5.0 database (the Netherlands). The environmental impact categories included and discussed in this study are eutrophication, global warming, landfill, acidification, ozone layer depletion and photochemical ozone creation. This study was performed for several design alternatives or scenarios of the wastewater facility. According to the LCA performed in this study, the most environmentally sustainable scenario is that which has the most effective and complicated treatment of sewage water and sludge.","Case studies; Life cycle impact assessment; Normalisation factors; Russian Federation; Sewage wastewater treatment facility; Weighting factors","acidification; article; building material; calculation; data analysis; data base; energy consumption; environmental economics; environmental impact; environmental monitoring; eutrophication; greenhouse effect; inventory control; landfill; life cycle; methodology; money; Netherlands; ozone layer; photochemistry; priority journal; Russian Federation; sewage treatment; sludge; standardization; water management",,,,,,"Bengtsson, M., Ludin, M., (1997) Life Cycle Assessment of Wastewater Systems, , Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden; Bjurklund, A., (1998) Environmental Systems Analysis of Waste Management With Emphasis on Substance Flow and Environmental Impact, , Report 211/, Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Stockholm; Blonk, T.J., (1996) Feasibility of Operationalisation of Depletion of Abiotic Resources in LCA via the Key Resources Energy and Land, , Amsterdam, The Netherlands; (1997), Russian State Committee for Statistics, Moscow, Russian FederationEggels, P.G., (1996) Het Zuiveren van Stedelijk Afvalwater in Het Licht Van Duurzame Milieuhygiënische Ontwikkeling, , STOWA. 96-15, The Netherlands; Goedcoop, M., Spriensma, R., (2000) The Eco-indicator 99.
