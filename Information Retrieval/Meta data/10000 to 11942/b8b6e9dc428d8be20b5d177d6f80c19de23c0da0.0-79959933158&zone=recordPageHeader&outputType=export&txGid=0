This paper provides a method for estimating the lake water storage based on historical meteorological records from 1976 to 2009, remote sensing images scattered in this period, in situ bathymetric survey, and GIS techniques, and presents a comprehensive 34-year analysis of intra-annual and inter-annual variations of Nam Co Lake water storage. The multi-year mean water storage of Nam Co Lake is 842.36×108m3, with the maximum water depth of about 98m. During 1976-2009, the lake water storage increased from 786.06×108m3 to 870.30×108m3, with a tendency value of 2.67×108m3/a; the lake area enlarged from 1927.48km2 to 2015.12km2, with a tendency value of 2.71km2/a. The lake area fluctuations annually, increasing from April of each year until late September and early October, then decreasing until March of the next year. Climate change has a significant impact on the water storage variation of the lake. A general pattern of warming temperature is evident with the regional annual mean air temperature increasing significantly by 0.404°C/10a. Preliminary analysis indicates that the enlarging status of Nam Co Lake water storage is closely related to increasing of precipitation and stream runoff especially coming from the input of glacial meltwater. By combining this data with other research, it can be presented that under the trend of global warming, on Tibetan Plateau, the inland lakes which depend on the rainfall and river supply in the basin are shrinking, while the lakes which depend on glacial meltwater supply are enlarging. Climate change is an important factor promoting the lake variation. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Nam Co Lake; Remote sensing; Tibetan Plateau; Water storage","Annual mean; Bathymetric survey; Central Tibetan plateau; General patterns; Glacial meltwater; In-situ; Interannual variation; Lake areas; Lake waters; Meteorological records; Nam Co Lake; Preliminary analysis; Remote sensing images; Significant impacts; Tibetan Plateau; Trend detection; Water depth; Water level variations; Water storage; Water storage variation; Bathymetry; Glacial geology; Global warming; Hydrographic surveys; Image reconstruction; Remote sensing; Water levels; Lakes; air temperature; annual variation; bathymetric survey; environmental factor; estimation method; GIS; global warming; lake water; meltwater; meteorology; precipitation intensity; rainfall; remote sensing; research work; runoff; water depth; water level; water management; China; Nam Co; Xizang",,,,,,"Allen, R.G., Pereira, L.S., Raes, D., Smith, M., Crop Evapotranspiration Guidelines for Computing Crop Water Requirements (1998), http://www.fao.org/docrep/X0490E/x0490e00.htm, FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper 56.
