Box 59997, Nairobi, Kenya","Kenya's heavy dependence on petroleum has had an adverse effect on its economy, making it difticult to achieve its development goals. Furthermore, the use of fossilfuels is accompanied by emissions of large quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere-a process that is enhancing the greenhouse effect and subsequent global warming and climate change. This article gives an analysis of the Kenya's current energy scene and discuses its alternative energy resources. Although renewable energies are at present not viable substitutes for oil, the development and exploitation of these energy resources will nor only reinforce conservation measures bur also promote new trends in technology development. © 1992 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,"Economics; Energy utilization; Biomass; Environmental protection; Solar energy; Alternative energy resources; Gross domestic product (GDP); Conventional energy resources; Energy consumption; Kenya; Renewable energy resources; Energy resources",,,,,,"Butcra, F.M., (1989) Renewable Energy Sources in Development Countries, Successes and Failures in Technology Transfer and Diffusion, , Rome: ENEA; (1990) Kenya Economic Survey of 1990, , Nairobi: Government Press; (1989) Kenya Economic Survey of 1989, , Nairobi: Government Press; Curran, S.C., Curran, J.S., (1979) Energy and Human Needs, , Edinburgh: Scottish Academy Press; (1986) Energy Conservation in Kenya: Experience of the Kenya Renewable Energy Development Project, , Nairobi: Energy Development International; Othieno, H., Energy conservation as the basis for appropriate technology development for kenya (1989) International Journal of Energy Exploration and Exploitation, 7 (2), pp. 103-115; (1986) The State of the environment—environment and Health, , United Nations Environmental Protectorate","Othieno, H.; Appropriate Technology Workshops, P.O.
