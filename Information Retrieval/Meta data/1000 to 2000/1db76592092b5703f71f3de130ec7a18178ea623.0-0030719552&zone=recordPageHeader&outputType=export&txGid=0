The geochemistry and mineralogy of endogenic calcium carbonate deposited in deep water, and stratigraphic studies of shore-zone deposits, provide evidence of millennial-scale lake-level fluctuations that had amplitudes of about 50 m between 30 and 10 ka. Falling-lake events occurred at 21, 18.5-19, 17.5, 16-15.5, 14-13, and 10 ka (radiocarbon years) svnchronously with the terminations of Heinrich events H1 and H2 and other smaller scale iceberg-rafting events (a, b, c, and Younger Dryas) in the North Atlantic Ocean. The Lake Bonneville results thus support other climate records that suggest that late Pleistocene millennial-scale climate change was global in extent. The size and shape of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, which determined the mean positions of storm tracks, may have been the primary control on late Pleistocene water budgets of Great Basin lakes.",,"climate change; global change; Heinrich event; iceberg rafting; lake level change; Pleistocene; USA, Great Basin, Lake Bonneville",,,,,,"Allen, B.D., Anderson, R.Y., Evidence from western North America for rapid shifts in climate during the last glacial maximum (1993) Science, 260, pp. 1920-1923; Antevs, E., Climatic changes and pre-White man (1948) University of Utah Bulletin, 38, pp. 168-191. , The Great Basin with emphasis on glacial and postglacial times; Benson, L.V., Thompson, R.S., The physical record of lakes in the Great Basin (1987) Geology of North America, K-3, pp. 241-260. , Ruddiman, W.
