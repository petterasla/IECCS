We report an intercomparison, using two different radiative transfer methods, aimed at clarifying the forcing values for HFC-23 and HFC-134a, as well as HFC-227ea and HFC-32. The calculated global, annual mean radiative forcings differed by 12% or less and are within the expected errors in the radiative forcing estimates.
