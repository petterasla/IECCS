Firstly, historical observed data sets covering 1961-2007 were analyzed to detect extreme events and their decade-by-decade trends. Extreme events and their changes are quite different over the 7 sub-regions, owing to their different local climate. Secondly, the extremes of each sub-region detected from the simulation of RegCM3 for the baseline period 1980-1999 were applied to the projection in the years 2001-2050, based on the IPCC SRES A1B and A2 scenarios, to reveal the changing trend of extremes in the future. The RegCM3 projections indicate that, in general, hot summer days will increase and cold winter nights will decrease as a consequence of global warming. The rainy season heavy rainfall events tend to decrease for all sub-regions except for 2, in northwest and south-central Vietnam. Strong opposite projected changes in precipitation extremes over the southern half of Vietnam seem to be linked to changes in southwesterly air flow from the Bay of Bengal and the number of strong tropical cyclones coming from the South China Sea and the NW Pacific. © Inter-Research 2011.","Detection; Extreme events; RegCM; Regional climate model; Scenarios; Vietnam","Extreme events; RegCM; Regional climate model; Scenarios; Viet Nam; Computer simulation; Global warming; Rain; Storms; Climate models; airflow; climate conditions; climate modeling; climate prediction; data set; extreme event; global warming; historical record; precipitation intensity; rainfall; regional climate; trend analysis; tropical cyclone; Viet Nam",,,,,,"Alexander, L.V., Zhang, X., Peterson, T.C., Caesar, J., Global observed changes in daily climate extremes of temperature and precipitation (2006) J Geophys Res, 111, pp. DO5109; Anthes, R., Hsie, E., Kuo, Y.H., (1987) Description of the Penn State/NCAR Mesoscale Model Version 4 (MM4), , Tech Rep NCAR/TN-282, National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder, CO; Bell, J.L., Sloan, L.C., Snyder, M.A., Regional changes in extreme climatic events: A future climate scenario (2004) Journal of Climate, 17 (1), pp. 81-87; Dickinson, R.E., Henderson-Sellers, A., Kennedy, P.J., (1993) Bio Sphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme (BATS) Version 1e As Coupled to the NCAR Community Climate Model, , National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder, CO; Diffenbaugh, N.S., Ashfaq, M., Intensification of hot extremes in the United States (2010) Geophys Res Lett, 37, pp. L15701. , doi:10.1029/2010GL043888; Endo, N., Matsumoto, J., Lwin, T., Trends in precipitation extremes over Southeast Asia (2009) Sci Online Lett Atmos, 5, pp. 168-171; Francis, D., Hengeveld, D., (1998) Extreme Weather and Climate Change, , Canada Minister of Supply and Services, Climate and Water Productions Division, Ottawa; Ghosh, S., Luniya, V., Gupta, A., Trend analysis of Indian summer monsoon rainfall at different spatial scales (2009) Atmos Sci Lett, 10, pp. 285-290. , doi:10.1002/asl.235; Giorgi, F., Regional climate modeling: Status and perspectives (2006) Journal De Physique.
