In evaluation of the environmental consequences of this heat production, the typical approach has been to assume that other (fossil) fuels could be saved on a 1:1 basis (e.g. 1GJ of waste heat delivered substitutes for 1GJ of coal-based heat). This paper investigates consequences of waste-based heat substitution in two specific Danish district heating networks and the energy-associated interactions between the plants connected to these networks. Despite almost equal electricity and heat efficiencies at the waste incinerators connected to the two district heating networks, the energy and CO2 accounts showed significantly different results: waste incineration in one network caused a CO2 saving of 48kg CO2/GJ energy input while in the other network a load of 43kg CO2/GJ. This was caused mainly by differences in operation mode and fuel types of the other heat producing plants attached to the networks. The paper clearly indicates that simple evaluations of waste-to-energy efficiencies at the incinerator are insufficient for assessing the consequences of heat substitution in district heating network systems. The paper also shows that using national averages for heat substitution will not provide a correct answer: local conditions need to be addressed thoroughly otherwise we may fail to assess correctly the heat recovery from waste incineration. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Denmark; District heating networks; Energy inputs; Energy recovery; Environmental consequences; Fuel types; Heat efficiency; Heat production; Heat recovery; Heat-producing; Local conditions; Municipal solid waste incinerations; Operation mode; Waste incinerator; Waste to energy; Computer system recovery; District heating; Energy conversion; Energy efficiency; Heating; Heating equipment; Metal recovery; Refuse incinerators; Solid wastes; Waste heat; Waste incineration; carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; natural gas; carbon dioxide; energy efficiency; heat production; heating; incineration; municipal solid waste; article; biomass; controlled study; Denmark; energy conservation; energy cost; energy recovery; energy resource; incineration; municipal solid waste; priority journal; renewable energy; Air Pollutants; Carbon Dioxide; Conservation of Energy Resources; Denmark; Efficiency; Environment; Incineration; Power Plants; Denmark",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; natural gas, 8006-14-2; Air Pollutants; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9",,,,"Astrup, T., (2009), Estimating contents of biogenic and fossil carbon in municipal solid waste.
