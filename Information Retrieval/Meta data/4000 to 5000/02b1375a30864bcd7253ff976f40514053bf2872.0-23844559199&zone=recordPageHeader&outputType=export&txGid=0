One defines an intergenerational game where each generation has a random life duration and transfers the control of the economic system to the next generation at the end of its life. The payoff to a generation is a discounted sum of the expected consumption by the whole infinite sequence of generations, starting with the current one. The equilibrium is characterized by a dynamic programming equation; a unique solution is proved to exist; a numerical technique is proposed and implemented on a continuous time simplified version of the model DICE94. The results show the influence of this form of altruism on the asymptotic steady states of the economy subject to a global climate change effect. © 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.","Climate change policies; Cost-benefit analysis; Discounting; Intergenerational equilibrium; Intergenerational equity; Stochastic game; Turnpike solutions",,,,,,,"Ainslie, G., Haslam, N., Hyperbolic discounting (1992) Choice over Time, , Loewenstein and Elster (eds.).
