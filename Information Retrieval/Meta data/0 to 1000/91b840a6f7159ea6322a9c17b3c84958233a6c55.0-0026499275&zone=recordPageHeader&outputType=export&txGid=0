Some 92.6-96.7, 94.7-99.9, and 87.0-89.0% of hatchlings produced in 1986, 1987, and 1988, respectively, were females. These skewed sex ratios were consistent with the fact that for most of the season, sand temperatures were above the pivotal level for loggerhead turtles. Measurements of beach temperatures at the depth of turtle nests were extended to cover 5 yr. These temperatures were commonly above the pivotal level. The strongly female-biased hatchling sex ratio found in this population may complicate conservation efforts, since global warming might be expected to skew the sex ratio still further toward females. -from Authors",,"conservation; global warming; loggerhead; sex ratio; temperature; turtle; USA, Florida, Cape Canaveral; Caretta caretta",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00084301,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026499275
