Opportunities for reserve creation are quickly being lost as new areas are opened to deforestation though highway construction and other developments. Leakage, or the effects that a reserve or other mitigation project provokes outside of the project boundaries, is critical to a proper accounting of net carbon benefits. Protected areas in the Amazon have particularly great potential mitigation benefits over an extended time horizon. Over a 100-year time frame, virtually no unprotected forest is likely to remain, meaning that potential leakages (both leakage to the vicinity of the reserves and that displaced by removing protected areas from the land-grabbing market) should not matter much because any short-term leakage would be ""recovered"" eventually. The effect of the value attributed to time greatly influences the impact of leakage on benefits credited to reserves. Simple assumptions regarding leakage scenarios illustrate the benefits of reserves and the critical areas where agreement is necessary to make this option a practical component of mitigation efforts. The stakes are too high to allow further delays in reaching agreement on these issues. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2009.","Avoided deforestation; Brazil; Deforestation; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Kyoto protocol; Mitigation; REDD; Reduced emissions","carbon; deforestation; global warming; greenhouse effect; human activity; Kyoto Protocol; leakage; mitigation; nature reserve; Amazonas [Brazil]; Brazil; South America",,,,,,"Fearnside, P.M., Global warming response options in Brazil's forest sector: Comparison of project-level costs and benefits (1995) Biomass Bioenergy, 8, pp. 309-322. , doi:10.1016/0961-9534(95)00024-0; Fearnside, P.M., Land-tenure issues as factors in environmental destruction in Brazilian Amazonia: The case of southern Pará (2001) World Dev, 29, pp. 1361-1372. , doi:10.1016/S0305-750X(01)00039-0; Fearnside, P.M., Time preference in global warming calculations: A proposal for a unified index (2002) Ecol Econ, 41, pp. 21-31. , doi:10.1016/S0921-8009(02)00004-6; Fearnside, P.M., Why a 100-year time horizon should be used for global warming mitigation calculations (2002) Mitig Adapt Strategies Glob Chang, 7, pp. 19-30. , doi:10.1023/A:1015885027530; Fearnside, P.M., The roles and movements of actors in the deforestation of Brazilian Amazonia (2008) Ecol Soc, 13, p. 23. , http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol13/iss1/art23/, Available at; Fearnside, P.M., On the value of temporary carbon: A comment on Kirschbaum (2008) Mitig Adapt Strategies Glob Chang, 13, pp. 207-210. , doi:10.1007/s11027-007-9112-7; Fearnside, P.M., The value of protected areas in avoiding climate change in Amazonia (2008) Updating of Priority Areas for Conservation, Sustainable Use and Sharing of the Biodiversity Benefits-Amazon Biome, pp. 8-11. , R.
