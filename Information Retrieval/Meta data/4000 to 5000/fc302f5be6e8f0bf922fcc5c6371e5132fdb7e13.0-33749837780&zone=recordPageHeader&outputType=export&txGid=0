Six globally coupled atmosphere-ocean models' outputs under the SRES A2 greenhouse gas and aerosol emission scenario, provided by the IPCC Data Distribution Center and the Hadley Center for Climate Prediction and Research, are then systematically examined. It follows that the above EASM weakening is not closely related to synchronizing anthropogenic global warming, and, therefore, it should be qualitatively natural change process. Over the 21st century, the EASM intensity is likely increased slightly by continually intensified greenhouse effect relative to the late 20th century.","East Asian summer monsoon; Global warming; Interdecadal weakening; Natural change",,,,,,,"Huang, R.H., Advances in the characteristics, mechanism, and prediction of climatic disaster in China (1999) Bulletin of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (in Chinese), (3), pp. 188-192; Van, Z.W., Ji, J.J., Yeh, T.C., Northern hemispheric summer climatic jump in the 1960s, part I - Rainfall and temperature (1990) Science in China, Ser.
