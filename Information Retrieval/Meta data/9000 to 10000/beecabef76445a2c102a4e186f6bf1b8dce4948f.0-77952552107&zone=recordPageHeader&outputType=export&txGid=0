Its position relative to major Asian climate systems makes it sensitive to global climate change. The lake has been the subject of numerous paleoenvironmental investigations including dating of shoreline features around the lake basin. Here we report new age estimates of shoreline features, geomorphic exposures and archaeological sites that contribute to the development of a lake-level history for Qinghai Lake and a landscape model of the Qinghai Lake Basin. Lake highstands above 3230. m (∼36. m above the modern lake level) appear to date to late MIS 5, ∼70-110. ka. The lake has had much more modest highstands since then: no evidence of MIS 3 lake stands higher than modern were found, and early Holocene highstands are no more than ∼12. m above modern. If the age of highstands greater than 3230. m is confirmed through future work, then the Qinghai Lake Basin hydrologic balance prior to ∼70. ka was dramatically different than after that time, including during the Holocene. A simple hydrologic balance model provides insights into the combination of precipitation, evaporation, and runoff generation needed to sustain the lake at 3260. m, the highest shoreline observed. A range of factors may explain the difference, primarily the relative strength of the East Asian monsoon. The basin was apparently subject to extensive alluviation during MIS 3, interrupted by widespread erosion and development of cryogenic features before and during the last glacial maximum (LGM). Loess that presently drapes much of the lower basin landscape began to be deposited after the LGM, ∼16-18. ka. The landscape model outlined here has implications for archaeological visibility of early human occupation of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.",,"archaeology; basin evolution; geomorphology; Holocene; human settlement; hydrological modeling; lake level; landscape evolution; Last Glacial Maximum; paleoenvironment; paleohydrology; China; Qinghai; Qinghai Lake; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",,,,,,"Aitken, M.J., Bowman, S.G.E., Thermoluminescent dating: Assessment of alpha particle contribution (1975) Archaeometry, 17, pp. 132-138; Aldenderfer, M.S., Moving up in the world: Archaeologists seek to understand how and when people came to occupy the Andean and Tibetan plateaus (2003) American Scientist, 91, pp. 542-550; Aldenderfer, M.S., Modelling plateau peoples: The early human use of the world's high plateaux (2006) World Archaeology, 38, pp. 357-370; An, Z., Kukla, G.J., Porter, S.C., Jule, X., Magnetic susceptibility evidence of monsoon variation on the Loess Plateau of central China during the last 130,000 years (1991) Quaternary Research, 36, pp. 29-36; An, Z.S., Porter, S.C., Kutzbach, J.E., Wu, X.H., Wang, S.M., Liu, X.D., Li, X.Q., Zhou, W.J., Asynchronous Holocene optimum of the East Asian monsoon (2000) Quaternary Science Reviews, 19, pp. 734-762; An, Z., Kutzbach, J.E., Prell, W.L., Porter, S.C., Evolution of Asian monsoons and phased uplift of the Himalaya-Tibetan plateau since Late Miocene times (2001) Nature, 411, pp. 62-66; Balescu, S., Lamothe, M., The blue emission of K-feldspar coarse grains and its potential for overcoming TL age (1992) Quaternary Science Reviews, 11, pp. 45-51; Benn, D.I., Owen, L.A., The role of the Indian summer monsoon and the mid-latitude westerlies in Himalayan glaciation: review and speculative discussion (1998) Journal of the Geological Society, 155, pp. 353-363; Brantingham, P., Gao, X., Peopling of the northern Tibetan Plateau (2006) World Archaeology, 38, pp. 387-414; Brantingham, P.J., Gao, X., Olsen, J.W., Ma, H., Rhode, D., Zhang, H., Madsen, D.B., A short chronology for the peopling of the Tibetan Plateau (2007) Developments in Quaternary Science, 9, pp. 129-150. , Elsevier, Amsterdam, D.B.
