Study findings reveal deep concern among federal, state and local experts and decision makers about adverse impacts at the local level. A large majority of respondents recognize the increasing likelihood of dynamic, potentially irreversible, socioeconomic and ecological repercussions for the Florida Keys. However, very few experts and decision makers report that their respective agencies have developed formal adaptation plans. Respondents identify significant institutional and social barriers to adaptation and convey their support for a host of strategic measures to facilitate adaptation on an urgent basis. The implications of our findings are discussed in the context of enhancing adaptive capacity and resilience in the Florida Keys and beyond. Information generated from this study can provide functional guidance for improving decision-support systems and promoting adaptation policies. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Adaptive capacity; Decision makers; Florida keys; Formal adaptation; Global climate changes; Local experts; Climate change; Decision making; Decision support systems; Ecology; Surveys; Behavioral research; climate change; decision making; decision support system; elite politics; socioeconomic status; vulnerability; Florida [United States]; Florida Keys; United States",,,,,,"Ackerman, F., Stanton, E.A., The costs of inaction: what we'll pay if global warming continues unchecked (2008)Adger, W.N., Arnell, N.W., Tompkins, E.L., (2005) Global Environmental Change, 15, pp. 75-86; Adger, W.N., Hughes, T.P., Folke, C., Carpenter, S.R., Rockström, J., (2005) Science, 309, pp. 36-1039; American Psychological Association (APA), Psychology and global climate change: addressing a multifaceted phenomenon and set of challenges (2009), Task force on the interface between psychology and global climate changeBarnett, J., Adger, W.N., (2003) Climatic Change, 61, pp. 321-337; Bender, M.A., Knutson, T.R., Tuleya, R.E., Sirutis, J.J., Vecchi, G.A., Garner, S.T., (2010) Science, 327, pp. 454-458; Berkes, F., (2007) Natural Hazards, 41, pp. 283-295; Berkhout, F., Hertin, J., Gann, D.M., (2006) Climatic Change, 78, pp. 135-156; Bigano, A., Bosello, F., Roson, R., Tol, R.S.J., (2008) Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change, 13, pp. 765-791; Bostrom, A., (1997) Duke Environmental Law and Policy Forum, 8, pp. 101-113; Brinkley, D., (2009) The wilderness warrior: Theodore Roosevelt and the crusade for America, , HarperCollins Publishers, New York; Bruckner, A.W., Hourigan, T.F., (2002) Proceedings of the 9th international coral reef symposium, Bali; Burton, I., Huq, S., Lim, B., Pilifosova, O., Schipper, E.L., (2002) Climate Policy, 2, pp. 145-159; Cameron, T.A., (2005) Journal of Risk and Uncertainty, 30, pp. 63-97; Donahue, S., Acosta, A., Akins, L., Ault, J., Bohnsack, J., The state of coral reef ecosystems of the Florida Keys (2008) The State of Coral Reef Ecosystems of the US and Pacific Freely Associated States: 2008.
