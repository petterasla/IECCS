The temperature rise is estimated by a gas transfer flux. It is very difficult to measure and estimate the gas transfer rate resulting from the air-sea interaction because of very high Schmidt number (Sc) turbulent fluid flow with free surface deformation. On the other hand, the utilization of high Prandtl number (Pr) fluid flows, like a Flibe, with free surface as a coolant in an advanced magnetic fusion reactor and as a chamber protection scheme in an inertial confinement fusion reactor have been considered. From the perspective of thermofluid research, it would be very important to discuss on some common aspects between fusion nuclear technology and global warming problem. Since the thermal diffusivities of high Pr or Sc fluids are very small, when the high temperature or concentration regions appear on the free surface caused by plasma radiation or carbon-dioxide gas absorption, respectively, the scalar transport from the free surface to the bulk flow must be very slow compared with the fluid motion. In this paper, some common aspects between the heat transfer of high Pr free surface flow in fusion engineering and the mass transfer of high Sc free surface flow in the global warming problem are discussed. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.
