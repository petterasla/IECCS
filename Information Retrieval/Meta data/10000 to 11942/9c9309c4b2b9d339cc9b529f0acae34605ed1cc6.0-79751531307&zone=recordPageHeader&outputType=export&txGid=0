Ocean Drive, Dania Beach, FL 33004, United States","The corals of the Persian/Arabian Gulf are better adapted to temperature fluctuations than elsewhere in the Indo-Pacific. The Gulf is an extreme marine environment displaying the highest known summer water temperatures for any reef area. The small and shallow sea can be considered a good analogue to future conditions for the rest of the world's oceans under global warming. The fact that corals can persist in such a demanding environment indicates that they have been able to acclimatize and selectively adapt to elevated temperature. The implication being that colonies elsewhere may be able to follow suit. This in turn provides hope that corals may, given sufficient time, similarly adapt to survive even in an impoverished form, under conditions of acidification-driven lowering of CaCO3 saturation state, a further consequence of raised atmospheric CO2. This paper demonstrates, however, that the uniquely adapted corals of the Gulf may, within the next three centuries, be threatened by a chronic habitat shortage brought about by the dissolution of the lithified seabed on which they rely for colonisation. This will occur due to modifications in the chemical composition of the Gulf waters due to climate change. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Coral habitat; Global change; Marine hardground; Persian/Arabian Gulf","Achilles' heel; Atmospheric CO; Chemical compositions; Colonisation; Coral habitat; Elevated temperature; Global change; Gulf waters; Marine environment; Marine hardground; Persian/Arabian Gulf; Saturation state; Shallow sea; Temperature fluctuation; Water temperatures; Chemical modification; Dissolution; Global warming; Ecosystems; calcium carbonate; carbon dioxide; acclimation; adaptation; colonization; coral; global ocean; global warming; habitat use; marine environment; survival; water temperature; acidification; article; atmosphere; chemical composition; climate change; controlled study; coral; coral reef; greenhouse effect; marine environment; Saudi Arabia; species habitat; temperature acclimatization; water temperature; Acclimatization; Animals; Anthozoa; Calcium Carbonate; Carbon Dioxide; Geologic Sediments; Global Warming; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Oceans and Seas; Seasons; Seawater; Temperature; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Arabian Sea; Indian Ocean; Persian Gulf; Anthozoa",,"calcium carbonate, 13397-26-7, 13701-58-1, 14791-73-2, 471-34-1; carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Calcium Carbonate, 471-34-1; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Water Pollutants, Chemical",,,,"Abuzinada, A.H., Barth, H.-J., Krupp, F., Böer, B., Al Abdessalaam, T.H., (2008) Protecting the Gulf's Marine Ecosystems from Pollution, , Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel; Baker, A.C., Starger, C.J., McClanahan, T.R., Glynn, P.W., Coral reefs: corals' adaptive response to climate change (2004) Nature, 430, p. 741; Budd, A.F., Pandolfi, J.M., Evolutionary novelty is concentrated at the edge of coral species distributions (2010) Science, 328, pp. 1558-1561; Buddemeier, R.W., Wilkinson, C.R., (1994) Global Climate Change and Coral Reefs: Implications for People and Reefs, p. 107. , IUCN, Gland (Switzerland); Caldeira, K., Wickett, M.E., Oceanography: anthropogenic carbon and ocean pH (2003) Nature, 425, p. 365; Grammer, G.M., Ginsburg, R.N., Swart, P.K., McNeill, D.F., Jull, A.J.T., Prezbindowski, D.R., Rapid growth rates of syndepositional marine aragonite cements in steep marginal slope deposits, Bahamas and Belize (1993) Journal of Sedimentary Research, 63, pp. 983-989; Hughes, T.P., Baird, A.H., Bellwood, D.R., Card, M., Connolly, S.R., Folke, C., Grosberg, R., Roughgarden, J., Climate change, human impacts, and the resilience of coral reefs (2003) Science, 301, pp. 929-933; Johnson, D.P., Risk, M.J., Fringing reef growth on a terrigenous mud foundation, Fantome Island, central Great Barrier reef, Australia (1987) Sedimentology, 34, pp. 275-287; Kleypas, J.A., Buddemeier, R.W., Archer, D., Gattuso, J.-P., Langdon, C., Opdyke, B.N., Geochemical consequences of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide on coral reefs (1999) Science, 284, pp. 118-120; Kobluk, D.R., Risk, M.J., Micritization and carbonate-grain binding by endolithic algae (1977) AAPG Bulletin, 61, pp. 1069-1082; Lewis, E., Wallace, D.W.R., (1998), Program developed for CO2 system calculations.
