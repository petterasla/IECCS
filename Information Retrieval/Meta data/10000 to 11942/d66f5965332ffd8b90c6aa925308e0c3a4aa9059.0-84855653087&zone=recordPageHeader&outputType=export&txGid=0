This article estimates the health costs associated with six climate change-related events that struck the United States between 2000 and 2009. The six case studies came from categories of climate change-related events projected to worsen with continued global warming-ozone pollution, heat waves, hurricanes, infectious disease outbreaks, river flooding, and wildfires. We estimate that the health costs exceeded $14 billion, with 95 percent due to the value of lives lost prematurely. Actual health care costs were an estimated $740 million. This reflects more than 760,000 encounters with the health care system. Our analysis provides scientists and policy makers with a methodology to use in estimating future health costs related to climate change and highlights the growing need for public health preparedness. © 2011 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.",,"air pollution; article; climate change; fire; flood tide; greenhouse effect; health care cost; heat; hurricane; mortality; United States; Climate Change; Databases, Factual; Disasters; Disease Outbreaks; Environmental Pollution; Fires; Floods; Health Care Costs; History, 21st Century; Humans; Mortality; United States",,,,,,"(2009) Global climate change impacts in the United States: a state of knowledge report, , US Global Change Research Program.
