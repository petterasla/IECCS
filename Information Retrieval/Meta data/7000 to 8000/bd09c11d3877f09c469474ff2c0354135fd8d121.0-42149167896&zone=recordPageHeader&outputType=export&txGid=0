Therefore, it is crucial to understand how Sphagnum vegetation in peat bogs will respond to global warming. We performed a greenhouse experiment to study the effect of four temperature treatments (11.2, 14.7, 18.0 and 21.4°C) on the growth of four Sphagnum species: S. fuscum and S. balticum from a site in northern Sweden and S. magellanicum and S. cuspidatum from a site in southern Sweden. In addition, three combinations of these species were made to study the effect of temperature on competition. We found that all species increased their height increment and biomass production with an increase in temperature, while bulk densities were lower at higher temperatures. The hollow species S. cuspidatum was the least responsive species, whereas the hummock species S. fuscum increased biomass production 13-fold from the lowest to the highest temperature treatment in monocultures. Nutrient concentrations were higher at higher temperatures, especially N concentrations of S. fuscum and S. balticum increased compared to field values. Competition between S. cuspidatum and S. magellanicum was not influenced by temperature. The mixtures of S. balticum with S. fuscum and S. balticum with S. magellanicum showed that S. balticum was the stronger competitor, but it lost competitive advantage in the highest temperature treatment. These findings suggest that species abundances will shift in response to global warming, particularly at northern sites where hollow species will lose competitive strength relative to hummock species and southern species. © 2008 The Author(s).","Bog; Cover change; Global warming; Greenhouse; Species composition","nitrogen; phosphorus; potassium; carbon sequestration; comparative study; global warming; growth response; height; intraspecific competition; moss; nutrient availability; phytomass; temperature effect; article; biomass; comparative study; greenhouse effect; growth, development and aging; metabolism; Sphagnopsida; Sweden; temperature; wetland; Biomass; Greenhouse Effect; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Potassium; Sphagnopsida; Sweden; Temperature; Wetlands; Sphagnum; Sphagnum balticum; Sphagnum cuspidatum; Sphagnum fuscum; Sphagnum magellanicum",,"nitrogen, 7727-37-9; phosphorus, 7723-14-0; potassium, 7440-09-7; Nitrogen, 7727-37-9; Phosphorus, 7723-14-0; Potassium, 7440-09-7",,,,"Abramoff, M.D., Magelhaes, P.J., Ram, S.J., Image processing with imageJ (2004) Biophotonics Int, 11, pp. 36-42; Alexandersson, H., Karlström, C., Larsson-Mccann, S., (1991) Temperature and Precipitation in Sweden 1961-90.
