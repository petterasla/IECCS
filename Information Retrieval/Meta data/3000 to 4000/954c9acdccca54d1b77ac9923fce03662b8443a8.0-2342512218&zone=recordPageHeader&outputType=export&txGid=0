These species are biological control agents of Lantana camara L. (Verbenaceae), with a leaf-mining larval phase and free-living, leaf-chewing adults. Plants grown at elevated CO2 had enhanced above-ground biomass, thicker leaves, reduced nitrogen concentration, and increased C:N ratios. Under the high temperature treatment, plants grown at ambient CO2 suffered wilting and premature leaf loss, despite daily watering; this effect was ameliorated at elevated CO2. The wilting of plants in the ambient CO 2/high temperature treatment reduced the emergence success of the beetles, particularly O. championi. Development time was accelerated by approximately 10-13 days at the higher temperature, but was not affected by CO2. Neither CO2 nor temperature affected adult beetle weight. Consumption rates of free-living beetles were not affected by either CO2 or temperature. By contrast, in the short-term trials using excised foliage, beetles given no choice between ambient and elevated CO 2-grown foliage, consumed more from ambient plants. When beetles were offered a choice between foliage grown at the two CO2 levels, O. championi did not display a significant preference but O. scabripennis consumed more ambient CO2-grown foliage when feeding at the lower temperature. This study indicates that under future conditions of higher temperatures, amelioration of water stress in host plants growing in elevated CO2 may benefit some endophagous insects by reducing premature leaf loss. Under some circumstances, this benefit may outweigh the deleterious effects of lower leaf nitrogen. Our results also indicate that foliage consumption under elevated CO2 by mobile, adult insects on whole plants may not be significantly increased, as was previously indicated by short-term experiments using excised foliage.","Biological control agents; Chrysomelidae; Coleoptera; Elevated CO2; Global warming; Lantana; Octotoma; Temperature; Verbenaceae","beetle; biological control; carbon dioxide enrichment; developmental biology; feeding behavior; global warming; plant-herbivore interaction; water stress; weed control; wilting; Chrysomelidae; Coleoptera; Hexapoda; Insecta; Lantana; Lantana camara; Octotoma scabripennis; Verbenaceae",,,,,,"Aranwela, N., Sanson, G., Read, J., Methods of assessing leaf-fracture properties (1999) New Phytologist, 144, pp. 369-393; Arnone III, J.A., Zaller, J.G., Zandt, H., Körner, C., Leaf quality and insect herbivory in model tropical plant communities after long-term exposure to elevated atmospheric CO2 (1995) Oecologia, 104, pp. 72-78; Auerbach, M., Relative impact of interactions within and between trophic levels during an insect outbreak (1991) Ecology, 72, pp. 1599-1608; Auerbach, M., Simberloff, D., Rapid leaf-miner colonization of introduced trees and shifting sources of herbivore mortality (1988) Oikos, 52, pp. 41-50; Auerbach, M., Simberloff, D., Oviposition site preference and larval mortality in a leaf-mining moth (1989) Ecological Entomology, 14, pp. 131-140; Bezemer, T.M., Jones, T.H., Plant-insect herbivore interactions in elevated atmospheric CO 2: Quantitative analyses and guild effects (1998) Oikos, 82, pp. 212-222; Broughton, S., Review and evaluation of Lantana biocontrol programs (2000) Biological Control, 17, pp. 272-286; Buse, A., Good, J.E.G., Synchronization of larval emergence in winter moth (Operophtera brumata L.) and budburst in pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) under simulated climate change (1996) Ecological Entomology, 21, pp. 335-343; Connor, E.F., Taverner, M.P., The evolution and adaptive significance of the leaf-mining habit (1997) Oikos, 79, pp. 6-25; Cotrufo, M.F., Ineson, P., Scott, A., Elevated CO2 reduces the nitrogen concentration of plant tissues (1998) Global Change Biology, 4, pp. 43-54; Coviella, C.E., Trumble, J.T., Effects of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide on insect-plant interactions (1999) Conservation Biology, 13, pp. 700-712; Dury, S.J., Good, J.E.G., Perrins, C.M., Buse, A., Kaye, T., The effects of increasing CO2 and temperature on oak leaf palatability and the implications for herbivorous insects (1998) Global Change Biology, 4, pp. 55-61; Ewert, F., Pleijel, H., Phenological development, leaf emergence, tillering and leaf area index, and duration of spring wheat across Europe in response to CO2 and ozone (1999) European Journal of Agronomy, 10, pp. 171-184; Hamerlynck, E.P., Huxman, T.E., Loik, M.E., Smith, S.D., Effects of extreme high temperature, drought and elevated CO2 on photosynthesis of the Mojave Desert evergreen shrub, Larrea tridentata (2000) Plant Ecology, 148, pp. 183-193; Harley, K.L.S., The suitability of Octotoma scabripennis Guer. and Uroplata girardi Pic (Col.
