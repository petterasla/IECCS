The objective of this life cycle assessment (LCA) study is to develop LCA models for energy systems in order to assess the potential environmental impacts that might result from meeting energy demands in buildings. The scope of the study includes LCA models of the average electricity generation mix in the USA, a natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power plant, a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cogeneration system; a microturbine (MT) cogeneration system; an internal combustion engine (ICE) cogeneration system; and a gas boiler. Methods. LCA is used to model energy systems and obtain the life cycle environmental indicators that might result when these systems are used to generate a unit energy output. The intended use of the LCA analysis is to investigate the operational characteristics of these systems while considering their potential environmental impacts to improve building design using a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) optimization model. Results. The environmental impact categories chosen to assess the performance of the energy systems are global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential (AP), tropospheric ozone precursor potential (TOPP), and primary energy consumption (PE). These factors are obtained for the average electricity generation mix, the NGCC, the gas boiler, as well as for the cogeneration systems at different part load operation. The contribution of the major emissions to the emission factors is discussed. Discussion. The analysis of the life cycle impact categories indicates that the electrical to thermal energy production ratio has a direct influence on the value of the life cycle PE consumption factors. Energy systems with high electrical to thermal ratios (such as the SOFC cogeneration systems and the NGCC power plant) have low PE consumption factors, whereas those with low electrical to thermal ratios (such as the MT cogeneration system) have high PE consumption factors. In the case of GWP, the values of the life cycle GWP obtained from the energy systems do not only depend on the efficiencies of the systems but also on the origins of emissions contributing to GWP. When evaluating the life cycle AP and TOPP, the types of fuel as well as the combustion characteristics of the energy systems are the main factors that influence the values of AP and TOPP. Conclusions. An LCA study is performed to evaluate the life cycle emission factors of energy systems that can be used to meet the energy demand of buildings. Cogeneration systems produce utilizable thermal energy when used to meet a certain electrical demand which can make them an attractive alternative to conventional systems. The life cycle GWP, AP, TOPP and PE consumption factors are obtained for utility systems as well as cogeneration systems at different part load operation levels for the production of one kWh of energy output. Recommendations and Perspectives. Although the emission factors vary for the different energy systems, they are not the only factors that influence the selection of the optimal system for building operations. The total efficiencies of the system play a significant part in the selection of the desirable technology. Other factors, such as the demand characteristics of a particular building, influence the selection of energy systems. The emission factors obtained from this LCA study are used as coefficients of decision variables in the formulation of an MILP to optimize the selection of energy systems based on environmental criteria by taking into consideration the system efficiencies, emission characteristics, part load operation, and building energy demands. Therefore, the emission factors should not be regarded as the only criteria for choosing the technology that could result in lower environmental impacts, but rather one of several factors that determine the selection of the optimum energy system. © 2007 ecomed publishers (Verlagsgruppe Hüthig Jehle Rehm GmbH).","Building energy systems; Cogeneration; Electrical energy system; Energy demands in buildings; Internal combustion engine (ICE) cogeneration system; Microturbine (MT) cogeneration system; Modeling energy systems; Natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power plant","fuel; natural gas; acidification; article; building; electric power plant; electricity; energy consumption; energy resource; environmental factor; environmental impact; greenhouse effect; life cycle assessment; priority journal; system analysis",,"natural gas, 8006-14-2",,,,"Arivalagan, A., Raghavendra, B.-G., Rao, A.-K., Integrated energy optimization model for a cogeneration based energy supply system in the process industry (1995) Electrical Power & Energy Systems, 17, pp. 227-233; Benelmir, R., Feidt, M., Energy Cogeneration Systems and Energy Management Strategy (1998) Energy Conversion and Management, 39, pp. 1791-1802; Marechal, F., Kalitventzeff, B., Process integration: Selection of the optimal utility system (1998) Computers Chem Eng, 22, pp. S149-S156; Kamimura, K., Mukai, T., Nishi, Y., Yokoyama, R.-K.-I., Development of an Optimal Operational Planning System Using an Object-Oriented Framework for Energy Supply Plants (1999) Sixth International IBPSA Conference, Building Simulation, , Kyoto, Japan; Riensche, E., Stimming, U., Unverzagt, G., Optimization of a 200 kW SOFC cogeneration power plant.
