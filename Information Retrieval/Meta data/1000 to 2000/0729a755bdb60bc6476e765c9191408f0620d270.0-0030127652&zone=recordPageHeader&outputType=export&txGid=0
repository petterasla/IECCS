Hydrogen and hydrogen enriched fuels can provide an improvement in the future. If hydrogen is produced from renewable sources, it will also contribute to the reduction of global warming. Due to the superior properties of hydrogen , with respect to efficiency and environmental characteristics, when burned in specially adapted combustion engines, gas turbines and fuel cells, the present EQHHPP phase focuses on hydrogen applications in future potential markets related to the transport sector. The overall goal of the demonstration phase of the EQHHPP is to advance hydrogen applications. Studies on hydrogen safety, regulations and acceptability, and on socio-economic aspects of hydrogen use, will support the technological development and demonstration activities. In that framework, various demonstration projects were started in 1992, with funds coming from the European Commission, from the Government of Québec and from industry and research centres. The demonstration projects mainly concern the utilization of hydrogen in airborne and urban transportation, the time frame being 1992 to 1997.",,"Air quality; Economic and social effects; Global warming; Hydrogen fuels; Internal combustion engines; Renewable energy resources; Combustion engines; Environmental characteristics; Hydrogen production; Socio economic aspects; Hydrogen",,,,,,"Gretz, J., Drolet, B., Kluyskens, D., Sandmann, F., Ullmann, O., Phase II and phase III.O of the 100 MW Euro-Québec hydro-hydrogen pilot project (1992) Proc. 9th World Hydrogen Energy Conference, , Paris; Price, R.O., Liquid hydrogen - An alternative aviation fuel?
