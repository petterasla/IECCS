Here we evaluate the observed warming trend using a 1,000-year time series of global temperature obtained from a mathematical model of the coupled ocean-atmosphere-land system. We find that the model approximately reproduces the magnitude of the annual to interdecadal variation in global mean surface air temperature. But throughout the simulated time series no temperature change as large as 0.5 °C per century is sustained for more than a few decades. Assuming that the model is realistic, these results suggest that the observed trend is not a natural feature of the interaction between the atmosphere and oceans. Instead, it may have been induced by a sustained change in the thermal forcing, such as that resulting from changes in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and aerosol loading.",,"air temperature; article; greenhouse effect; priority journal; coupled ocean-atmosphere-land system; global warming; model assessment; natural variability",,,,,,,"Stouffer, R.J.; Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Lab/NOAA, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08542, United States",,,,,,,,00280836,,NATUA,,"English","NATURE",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028182096
