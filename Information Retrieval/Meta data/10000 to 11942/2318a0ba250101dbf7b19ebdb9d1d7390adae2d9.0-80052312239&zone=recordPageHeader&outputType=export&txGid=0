CH 4 uptake in the first year after clear-cutting (-4.5 ± 0.2 μg C m -2 h -1) was three times lower than during the pre-harvest period (-14.2 ± 1.3 μg C m -2 h -1). In contrast, selective cutting did not significantly reduce CH 4 uptake. Annual mean uptake rates were -1.18 kg C ha -1 yr -1 (spruce control), -1.16 kg C ha -1 yr -1 (selective cut site) and -0.44 kg C ha -1 yr -1 (clear-cut site), respectively. Substantial seasonal and inter-annual variations in CH 4 fluxes were observed as a result of significant variability of weather conditions, demonstrating the need for long-term measurements. Our findings imply that a stepwise selective cutting instead of clear-cutting may contribute to mitigating global warming by maintaining a high CH 4 uptake capacity of the soil. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Clear-cutting;
