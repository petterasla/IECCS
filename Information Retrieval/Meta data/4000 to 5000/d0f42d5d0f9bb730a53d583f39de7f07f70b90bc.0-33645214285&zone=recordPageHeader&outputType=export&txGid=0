Committed sea level rise by 2100 is about an order of magnitude more, percentage-wise, compared to sea level rise simulated in the twentieth century. This increase in the model is produced only by thermal expansion of seawater, and does not take into account melt from ice sheets and glaciers, which could at least double that number. Several tenths of a degree of additional warming occurs in the model for the next 200 yr in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) B1 and A1B scenarios after stabilization in the year 2100, but with twice as much sea level rise after 100 yr, and doubling yet again in the next 100 yr to 2300. At the end of the twenty-first century, the warming in the tropical Pacific for the A2, A1B, and B1 scenarios resembles an El Niño-like response, likely due to cloud feedbacks in the model as shown in an earlier version. Greatest warming occurs at high northern latitudes and over continents. The monsoon regimes intensify somewhat in the future warmer climate, with decreases of sea level pressure at high latitudes and increases in the subtropics and parts of the midlatitudes. There is a weak summer midlatitude soil moisture drying in this model as documented in previous models. Sea ice distributions in both hemispheres are somewhat over-extensive, but with about the right ice thickness at the end of the twentieth century. Future decreases in sea ice with global warming are proportional to the temperature response from the forcing scenarios, with the high forcing scenario, A2, producing an ice-free Arctic in summer by the year 2100. © 2006 American Meteorological Society.",,"Climate change; Computer simulation; Glaciers; Greenhouse effect; Sea level; Seawater; Thermal expansion; Community climate system model version 3 (CCSM3); Greenhouse gases (GHGs); Sea level pressure; Climatology; climate change; climate modeling; El Nino; global warming; greenhouse gas; ice thickness; sea level change; twenty first century; Arctic",,,,,,"Ammann, C.M., Meehl, G.A., Washington, W.M., Zender, C., A monthly and latitudinally varying volcanic forcing dataset in simulations of 20th century climate (2003) Geophys.
