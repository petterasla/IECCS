Since 2001, households have been able to source-separate waste into six fractions of dry recyclables and food waste sorting. The current system was evaluated using the EASEWASTE life cycle assessment tool. Current status is compared with an ideal scenario in which households display perfect source-separation behaviour and a scenario without any material recycling. Results show that current recycling provides substantial environmental benefits compared to a non-recycling alternative. The environmental benefit varies greatly between recyclable fractions, and the recyclables currently most frequently source-separated by households are often not the most beneficial from an environmental perspective. With optimal source-separation of all recyclables, the current net contribution to global warming could be changed to a net-avoidance while current avoidance of nutrient enrichment, acidification and photochemical ozone formation could be doubled. Sensitivity analyses show that thetype of energy substituted by incineration of non-recycled waste, as well as energy used in recycling processes and in the production of materials substituted by waste recycling, is of high relevance for the attained results. © The Author(s) 2011.","Life-cycle assessment; producer responsibility; property close collection; recycling; solid household waste; source-separation","Current status; Current system; Domestic property; Environmental benefits; Food waste; Household solid waste; Household waste; Life cycle assessment tools; Life-cycle assessments; Material recycling; Nutrient enrichments; Photochemical ozone; producer responsibility; property close collection; Recyclables; Recycling process; Residential areas; source-separation; Waste recycling; Energy conversion; Environmental impact; Environmental impact assessments; Global warming; Incineration; Life cycle; Ozone; Rating; Recycling; Sensitivity analysis; Solid wastes; Waste incineration; energy use; environmental impact assessment; global warming; incineration; life cycle analysis; municipal solid waste; nutrient enrichment; optimization; ozone; recycling; sensitivity analysis; separation; waste treatment; acidification; air pollution; article; case study; domestic waste; energy recovery; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; greenhouse effect; landfill; life cycle assessment; organic waste; ozone layer; photochemistry; priority journal; recycling; residential area; sensitivity analysis; solid waste; solid waste management; Sweden; water pollution; Environment; Family Characteristics; Global Warming; Humans; Recycling; Refuse Disposal; Risk Assessment; Safety Management; Sweden; Waste Products; Sweden",,"Waste Products",,,,"(2008) Environmental Report 2008, , Ardagh AB, Limmared, Sweden;; Bernstad, A., La Cour Jansen, J., Aspegren, H., (2009) Proceedings from Twelfth International Waste Management and Landfill Symposium, , 5-9 October 2009.
