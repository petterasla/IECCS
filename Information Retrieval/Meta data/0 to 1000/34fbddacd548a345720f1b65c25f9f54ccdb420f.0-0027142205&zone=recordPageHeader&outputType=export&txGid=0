This cloche system was used in a manipulation experiment near Ny Ålesund, Spitsbergen, Svalbard. An average warming of 2.8 deg. C. was produced over a 60 day growing season, well within the range predicted by present climate models. The elevation effect is shown to be consistent over the diel cycle and throughout the short arctic summer season. Several advantages over previous designs of manipulation unit are highlighted. © 1993 Springer-Verlag GmbH & Co.
