The sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii (Diadematidae) has recently undergone poleward range expansion to relatively cool, macroalgal dominated rocky reefs of eastern Tasmania (southeast Australia). As in its historic environment, C. rodgersii in the extended range is now found in association with a simplified 'barrens' habitat grazed free of macroalgae. The new and important role of this habitat-modifier on reef structure and associated biodiversity was clearly demonstrated by completely removing C. rodgersii from incipient barrens patches at an eastern Tasmanian site and monitoring the macroalgal response relative to unmanipulated barrens patches. In barrens patches from which C. rodgersii was removed, there was a rapid proliferation of canopy-forming macroalgae (Ecklonia radiata and Phyllospora comosa), and within 24 months the algal community structure had converged with that of adjacent macroalgal beds where C. rodgersii grazing was absent. A notable scarcity of limpets on C. rodgersii barrens in eastern Tasmania (relative to the historic range) likely promotes rapid macroalgal recovery upon removal of the sea urchin. In the recovered macroalgal habitat, faunal composition redeveloped similar to that from adjacent intact macroalgal beds in terms of total numbers of taxa, total individuals and Shannon diversity. In contrast, the faunal community of the barrens habitat is overwhelmingly impoverished. Of 296 individual floral/faunal taxa recorded, only 72 were present within incipient barrens, 253 were present in the recovered patches, and 221 were present within intact macroalgal beds. Grazing activity of C. rodgersii results in an estimated minimum net loss of approximately 150 taxa typically associated with Tasmanian macroalgal beds in this region. Such a disproportionate effect by a single range-expanding species demonstrates that climate change may lead to unexpectedly large impacts on marine biodiversity as key habitat-modifying species undergo range modification. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Biodiversity; Centrostephanus rodgersii; Climate change; Kelp beds; Sea urchin barrens","biodiversity; climate change; community structure; echinoderm; habitat loss; kelp forest; macroalga; range expansion; reef; species diversity; taxonomy; alga; animal; article; Australia; biomass; ecosystem; greenhouse effect; growth, development and aging; sea urchin; Algae; Animals; Biomass; Ecosystem; Greenhouse Effect; Sea Urchins; Tasmania; Australasia; Australia; Tasmania; algae; Centrostephanus rodgersii; Diadematidae; Echinoidea; Ecklonia radiata; Patellidae; Phyllospora comosa",,,,,,"Anderson, M.J., A new method for non-parametric multivariate analysis of variance (2001) Austral Ecol, 26, pp. 32-46; Anderson, M.J., (2005) PERMANOVA: A FORTRAN Computer Program for Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance, , Department of Statistics, University of Auckland, New Zealand; Andrew, N.L., Changes in subtidal habitat following mass mortality of sea urchins in Botany Bay, New South Wales (1991) Aust J Ecol, 16, pp. 353-362; Andrew, N.L., Spatial heterogeneity, sea urchin grazing, and habitat structure on reefs in temperate Australia (1993) Ecology, 74, pp. 292-302; Andrew, N.L., Byrne, M., Lawrence, J.M., The ecology of Centrostephanus rodgersii (2001) Edible Sea Urchins: Biology and Ecology, pp. 149-160. , Elsevier Amsterdam; Andrew, N.L., O'Neill, A.L., Large-scale patterns in habitat structure on subtidal rocky reefs in New South Wales (2000) Mar Freshw Res, 51, pp. 255-263; Andrew, N.L., Underwood, A.J., Associations and abundance of sea urchins and abalone on shallow subtidal reefs in southern New South Wales (1992) Aust J Mar Freshw Res, 43, pp. 1547-1559; Andrew, N.L., Underwood, A.J., Density-dependent foraging in the sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii on shallow subtidal reefs in New South Wales, Australia (1993) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 99, pp. 89-98; Andrew, N.L., Worthington, D.G., Brett, P.A., Bentley, N., Chick, R.C., Blount, C., Interactions between the abalone fishery and sea urchins in New South Wales (1998) FRDC Final Report, , Project No. 93/102.
