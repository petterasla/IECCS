The average measured N2O flux from unfertilized plots through crop season was 4.16 ± 1.52, 5.05 ±- 1.65, 5.25 ± 1.68 and 6.74 ± 2.95 μg N20-N m-2 h-1, at Nakhon Sawan, Phra Phutthabat, Khon Kaen and Chiang Mai, respectively. Increased N2O emissions by the application of nitrogen fertilizer were 0.22-0.44, 0.19-0.38%, 0.12-0.24 and 0.08-0.15% of the applied N, respectively. Compared to other data, N2O emission rate to applied nitrogen was not significantly different between the data of Thailand and the Temperate Zone.","Global warming; Nitrification; Nitrogen fertilizer; Nitrous oxide; The Tropical Zone","agricultural land; emission; fertilizer application; flux chamber; nitrous oxide; Thailand",,,,,,"Bouman, A.F., Exchange of greenhouse gases between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere (1990) Soils and the Greenhouse Effects, pp. 61-127. , Bouman AF (ed) John Wiley & Sons, New York; Bouman, A.F., Direct emission of nitrous oxide from agricultural soils (1996) Nutr Cycl Agroecosyst, 46, pp. 53-70; Bremner, J.M., Blackmer, A.M., Terrestrial nitrification as a source of atmosphere nitrous oxide (1981) Denitrification, Nitrification and Atmospheric N2O, pp. 151-170. , Delwiche CC (ed) John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester; Cicerone, R.J., Analysis of sources and sinks of atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O) (1989) J Geophys Res, 94, pp. 18265-18271; Crutzen, P.J., Ozone production rates in oxygen-hydrogen-nitrogen oxide atmosphere (1971) J Geophys Res, 76, pp. 7311-7327; Eicher, M.J., Nitrous oxide emissions from fertilized soils: Summary of available data (1990) J Environ Qual, 19, pp. 272-290; (1995) Fertilizer Year Book, , FAO; (1995) Climate Change 1994, pp. 27-28. , Houghton JT, Meria Filho LG, Bruce J, Hoesung Lee, Callander BA, Haites E, Harris N & Maskell K (eds) Cambridge University Press, UK; Matson, P.A., Vitousek, P.M., Livingston, G.P., Swanberg, N.A., Sources of variation in nitrous oxide flux from Amazonian ecosystems (1990) J Geophys Res, 95, pp. 16789-16798; McTaggart, I.P., Smith, K.A., Nitrous oxide emission from arable and grassland soils: Effect of crop type and nitrification inhibitors (1996) 9th Nitrogen Workshop Braunschweig, pp. 523-526. , Abstracts Sept. 1996; Minami, K., Nitrous oxide emissions from agricultural fields Climate Change and Plants, , Singh SN (ed) Springer-Verlag, in press; Mosier, A.R., Duxbury, J.M., Freney, J.R., Hienemeyer, O., Minami, K., Nitrous oxide emissions from agricultural fields: Assessment, measurement and mitigation (1996) Plant Soil, 181, pp. 95-108; Sanhueza, E., Hao, W.M., Scharffe, D., Donoso, L., Crutzen, P.J., N2O and NO emissions from soils of the northern part of the Guayana Shield (1990) Venezuela.
