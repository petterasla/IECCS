In this study, subtle decreases of 2 and 4 parts per 1,000 in standard salinity were tested to see if the developmental rate of S. neumayeri embryos would be impacted by a potential hyposmotic stress. At 30 psu, significantly fewer embryos (2 individuals out of 198 tested) reached morula stage by 36 h post-fertilization in comparison embryos in control treatments at 34 psu. Antarctic sea urchins are an important component of marine environments due to their grazing activities. Reductions in larval recruitment success due to the influx of freshwater from melting ice shelves resulting from global climate change could have far-reaching impacts on benthic ecosystem structure in Antarctica. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Antarctica; Development; Embryos; Salinity; Sea urchin","benthos; echinoderm; ecosystem structure; embryonic development; grazing; salinity; temperature effect; Antarctica; Echinoidea; Sterechinus neumayeri",,,,,,"Allen, J.D., McAllister, J.S., Testing rates of planktonic versus benthic predation in the field (2007) J Exp Mar Biol Ecol, 347, pp. 77-87; Arntz, W.E., Brey, T., Gallardo, V.A., Antarctic zoobenthos (1994) Oceanogr Mar Biol Annu Rev, 32, pp. 241-304; Barker, M.F., Russell, M.P., The distribution and behaviour of Patiriella mortenseni and P. regularis in the extreme hyposaline conditions of the Southern New Zealand Fiords (2008) J Exp Mar Biol Ecol, 335, pp. 76-84; Binyon, J., (1966)Bosch, I., Beauchamp, K.A., Steele, M.E., Pearse, J.S., Development, metamorphosis, and seasonal abundance of embryos and larvae of the Antarctic sea urchin Sterechinus neumayeri (1987) Biol Bull, 173, pp. 126-135; Bressan, M., Marin, M., Brunetti, R., Influence of temperature and salinity on embryonic development of Paracentrotus lividus (Lmk, 1816) (1995) Hydrobiologia, 304, pp. 175-184; Brey, T., Gutt, J., The genus Sterechinus (Echinodermata: Echinoidea) on the Weddell Sea shelf and slope (Antarctica): Distribution, abundance and biomass (1991) Polar Biol, 11, pp. 227-232; Brey, T., Gerdes, D., High Antarctic macrobenthic community production (1998) J Exp Mar Biol Ecol, 231, pp. 191-200; Brey, T., Pearse, J., Basch, L., McClintock, J., Slattery, M., Growth and production of Sterechinus neumayeri (Echinoidea: Echinodermata) in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica (1995) Mar Biol, 124, pp. 279-292; Clarke, A., Johnston, N.M., Murphy, E.J., Rogers, A.D., Introduction.
