They have different characteristics when evaluated using different criteria. For example, some options may be very cost effective, while some may have an additional advantage of reducing local pollution. Hence, selection of these options, for consideration by a national government or by a funding agency, has to incorporate multiple criteria. In this paper, some important criteria relevant to the selection are discussed, and a multi-criteria methodology is suggested for making appropriate selection. The methodology, called the Analytic Hierarchy Process, is described using two illustrations.","Analytic hierarchy process; Climate change; Greenhouse gases; Mitigation; Selection criteria","analytical hierarchy process; emission control; greenhouse gas; pollution policy",,,,,,"Sagar, A.D., Automobiles and global warming: Alternative fuels and other options for carbon dioxide emissions reduction (1995) Environmental Impact Assessment Review, 15, pp. 241-274; Belton, V., Gear, T., On a shortcoming of Saaty's method of analytical hierarchies (1983) Omega, 11 (3), pp. 228-230; Crawford, G., Williams, C., A note on the analysis of subjective judgment matrices (1985) Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 29, pp. 387-405; Golden, B.L., Wasil, E.A., Levy, D.E., Applications of the analytic hierarchy process: A categorized, annotated bibliography (1989) The Analytic Hierarchy Process: Applications and Studies, pp. 37-58. , Golden, B.L., Wasil, E.A., Harker, P.T.
