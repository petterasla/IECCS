The authors analyse the implications of this shift for forest composition and biomass dynamics across the present-day boreonemoral zone in Scandinavia, using a forest succession model that includes a generalized disturbance regime and realistic climatic effects on species' regeneration and growth. Temperature increases in the range of 2-4 K in summer and 5-6 K in winter, typical of simulated CO2 doubling effects, force the boreonemoral zone &gt;1000 km northward from C Sweden where dominance passes from Picea to Fagus, Quercus and Pinus over 150-200 yr. Simulated increases of 175-250 mm in annual precipitation are required to counteract drought, which would otherwise reduce forest biomass and increase the representation of the more drought-tolerant species. -from Authors",,"boreal forest; climatic change; greenhouse effect; Sweden; Fagus; Picea; Pinus; Quercus",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026310158
