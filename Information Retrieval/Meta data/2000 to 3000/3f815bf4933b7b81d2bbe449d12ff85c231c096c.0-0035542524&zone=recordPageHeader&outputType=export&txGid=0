Thus, land uses such as an agroforestry system have a significant role in moderating climate change since they can be sources and sinks of carbon. The aim of the study was to generate data on the carbon stocks of two agroforestry systems, specifically a Gmelina arborea-Theobroma cacao multistorey system and an alley cropping system with Gliricidia sepium hedges at the agroforestry research and demonstration area inside a forest reserve in Southern Luzon, Philippines. The multistorey system had a mean biomass of 258 Mg C ha-1 and a carbon density of 185 Mg C ha-1. Carbon was stored in the various pools in the following order of magnitude: soil &gt; tree biomass (above-ground) &gt; necromass &gt; understorey vegetation &gt; roots. The Gliricidia hedgerow had a biomass density of 3.8 Mg C ha-1; total carbon density was 93 Mg C ha-1, of which 92 Mg C ha-1 was in the soil.","Agroforestry systems; Alley cropping; Cacao; Carbon sink; Carbon stocks; Climate change; Gliricidia sepium; Gmelina arborea; Multistorey system; Theobroma cacao",,,,,,,"Brady, N.C., Weil, R.R., (1996) The Nature and Properties of Soils. 11th Ed., pp. 362-380. , New Jersey: Prentice Hall Inc; Brown, S., (1997) Estimating Biomass and Biomass Change of Tropical Forests: A Primer, , FAO Forestry Paper No. 134.
