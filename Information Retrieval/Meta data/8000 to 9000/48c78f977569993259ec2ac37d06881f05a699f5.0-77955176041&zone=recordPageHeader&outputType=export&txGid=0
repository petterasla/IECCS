Some researchers have argued that the adoption of a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions and energy consumption as a long term policy goal will result in a closed-form relationship, to the detriment of the economy. Therefore, a perspective that can make allowances for the fact that the exclusive pursuit of economic growth will increase energy consumption and CO2 emissions is required; to the extent that such growth will have adverse effects with regard to global climate change. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon dioxide emissions; Economic growth; Energy consumption; Multivariate co-integration","Adverse effect; Carbon dioxide emissions; Causality test; Closed form; Cointegration; Economic growths; Energy consumption; Global climate changes; Granger causality test; Long-term policies; Carbon dioxide; Economics; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Global warming; Economic and social effects; carbon dioxide; climate change; economic growth; economic impact; emission control; energy policy; energy use; multivariate analysis; China",,,,,,"Xiangzhao, F., Ji, Z., Economic collection of CO2 emission trends in China Population (2008) Resour Environ, 18 (3), pp. 43-47; Zhang, M., Mu, H., Ning, Y., Song, Y., Decomposition of energy-related CO2 emission over 1991-2006 in China (2009) Ecol Econ, 68, pp. 2122-2128; Han, Z.Y., Wei, Y.M., On the cointegration and causality between Chinese GDP and energy consumption (2004) J Syst Eng, 12, pp. 17-21; Wolde-Rufael, Y., Disaggregated industrial energy consumption and GDP: the case of Shanghai, 1952-1999 (2004) Energy Econ, 26, pp. 69-75; Shiu, A., Lam, P.L., Electricity consumption and economic growth in China (2004) Energy Policy, 32 (1), pp. 47-54; Yuan, J., Zhao, C., Yu, S., Hu, Z., Electricity consumption and economic growth in China: cointegration and co-feature collection (2007) Energy Econ, 29 (6), pp. 1179-1191; Yu, W., Ju'e, G., Youmin, X., Study on the dynamic relationship between economic growth and china energy based on cointegration analysis and impulse response function, China population (2008) Resour Environ, 18 (4), pp. 56-61; Erol, U., Yu, E.S.H., On the relationship between electricity and income for industrialized countries (1987) J Electr Employ, 13, pp. 113-122; Cheng, B.S., Energy consumption and economic growth in Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela: a time series analysis (1997) Appl Econ Lett, 4, pp. 671-674; Masih, A.M.M., Masih, R., On the temporal causal relationship between energy consumption, real income, and prices: some new evidence from Asian-energy dependent NICs based on a multivariate cointegration/vector error-correction approach (1997) J Policy Model, 19 (4), pp. 417-440; Masih, A.M.M., Masih, R., A multivariate cointegrated modeling approach in testing temporal causality between energy consumption, real income and prices with an application to two Asian LDCs (1998) Appl Econ, 30 (10), pp. 1287-1298; Stern, D.I., Multivariate cointegration analysis of the role of energy in the US macroeconomy (2000) Energy Econ, 22, pp. 267-283; Stern, D.I., Energy and economic growth in the USA: a multivariate approach (1993) Energy Econ, 15, pp. 137-150; Hondroyiannis, G., Lolos, S., Papapetrou, E., Energy consumption and economic growth: assessing the evidence from Greece (2002) Energy Econ, 24 (4), pp. 319-336; Soytas, U., Sari, R., Energy consumption and GDP: causality relationship in G-7 countries and emerging markets (2003) Energy Econ, 25, pp. 33-37; Yemane, E.R., Disaggregated industrial energy consumption and GDP: the case of Shanghai (2004) Energy Econ, 26, pp. 69-75; Paul, S., Bhattacharya, R.N., Causality between energy consumption and economic growth in India: a note on conflicting results (2004) Energy Econ, 26, pp. 977-983; Lee, C.C., Energy consumption and GDP in developing countries: a cointegrated panel collection (2005) Energy Econ, 27, pp. 415-427; Granger, C.W.J., Investigating causal relations by econometric methods and cross-spectral methods (1969) Econometrica, 34, pp. 424-438; Phillips, P.C.B., Perron, P., Testing for a unit root in time series regression (1988) Biometrika, 75 (2), pp. 335-346; Greece, W.H., (1997) Econometric analysis, , Prentice-Hall, New Jersey; Hamilton, J.D., (1994) Time series analysis, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Sargan, J.D., Wages and prices in the United Kingdom: a study in econometric methodology (1964) Econometric analysis for national economic planning, , Butterworth, London, P.E.
