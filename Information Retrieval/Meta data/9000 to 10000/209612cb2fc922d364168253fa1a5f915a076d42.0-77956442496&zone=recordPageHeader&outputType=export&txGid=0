Environmental changes can alter plant's physiological state and trigger several signaling pathways for adaptation to unfavorable conditions. Plant response to abiotic stress includes changes in protein expression and post-translational modification of proteins to activate their defense system against the challenges. Research on plant proteomes has provided beneficial information for a comprehensive understanding of the protein networks in plants in response to external stimuli. Large-scale proteomics is a powerful approach for studies of complex biological processes in which a number of proteins take part; proteome analysis of sub-cellular structures and modified proteins has enabled identification of novel components of plant stress responses that had not previously been discovered. In this review, we have discussed the recent developments of crop proteomics in the context of several climatic factors including photosynthetic stress, air pollutants, thermal stress including heat and cold, and osmotic stress, including drought, salt, and flooding stress, and metal stress. The aim of this review is to take a snapshot of several proteomic approaches in crop plants that provide a comprehensive list of components affected by certain abiotic stresses in climate. The biological relevance of these proteins in regard to plant stress tolerance will be described as well. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.","Abiotic stress; Climate change; Crops; Proteome","Abiotic stress; Air pollutants; Biological process; Climatic changes; Climatic factors; Crop plants; Defense system; Environmental change; External stimulus; Flooding stress; Global climate changes; Metal stress; Modified proteins; Novel component; Osmotic stress; Photosynthetic stress; Physiological state; Plant response; Plant stress; Plant stress tolerance; Post-translational modifications; Protein expressions; Protein network; Proteome analysis; Proteomes; Proteomic approaches; Proteomics; Signaling pathways; Sub-cellular; Air pollution; Crops; Molecular biology; Plants (botany); Proteins; Climate change",,,,,,"Aghaei, K., Ehsanpour, A.A., Komatsu, S., Proteome analysis of potato under salt stress (2008) Journal of Proteome Research, 7, pp. 4858-4868; Aghaei, K., Ehsanpour, A.A., Shah, A.H., Komatsu, S., Proteome analysis of soybean hypocotyl and root under salt stress (2009) Amino Acids, 36, pp. 91-98; Agrawal, G.K., Hajduch, M., Graham, K., Thelen, J.J., In-depth investigation of the soybean seed-filling proteome and comparison with a parallel study of rapeseed (2008) Plant Physiology, 148, pp. 504-518; Agrawal, G.K., Jwa, N.S., Rakwal, R., Rice proteomics: ending phase I and the beginning of phase II (2009) Proteomics, 9, pp. 935-963; Ahsan, N., Lee, D.G., Alam, I., Kim, P.J., Lee, J.J., Ahn, Y.O., Comparative proteomic study of arsenic-induced differentially expressed proteins in rice roots reveals glutathione plays a central role during As stress (2008) Proteomics, 8, pp. 3561-3576; Ahsan, N., Lee, D.G., Lee, S.H., Kang, K.Y., Bahk, J.D., Choi, M.S., A comparative proteomic analysis of tomato leaves in response to waterlogging stress (2007) Physiologia Plantarum, 131, pp. 555-570; Ahsan, N., Lee, D.G., Lee, S.H., Kang, K.Y., Lee, J.J., Kim, P.J., Excess copper induced physiological and proteomic changes in germinating rice seeds (2007) Chemosphere, 67, pp. 1182-1193; Ahsan, N., Lee, D.G., Lee, S.H., Lee, K.W., Bahk, J.D., Lee, B.H., A proteomic screen and identification of waterlogging-regulated proteins in tomato roots (2007) Plant and Soil, 295, pp. 37-51; Ahsan, N., Lee, S.H., Lee, D.G., Lee, H., Lee, S.W., Bahk, J.D., Physiological and protein profiles alternation of germinating rice seedlings exposed to acute cadmium toxicity (2007) Comptes Rendus Biologies, 330, pp. 735-746; Ahsan, N., Renaut, J., Komatsu, S., Recent developments in the application of proteomics to the analysis of plant responses to heavy metals (2009) Proteomics, 9, pp. 2602-2621; Aina, R., Labra, M., Fumagalli, P., Vannini, C., Marsoni, M., Cucchi, U., Thiolpeptide level and proteomic changes in response to cadmium toxicity in Oryza sativa L. roots (2007) Environ.
