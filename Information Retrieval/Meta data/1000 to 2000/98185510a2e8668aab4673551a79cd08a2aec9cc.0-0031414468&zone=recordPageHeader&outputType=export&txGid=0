It is about fairness and income distribution among nations, both now and in the future. It is a dynamic problem that involves national carbon transition functions, damage functions and discount rates. These issues form the basis of the current paper, which examines them from a conceptual point of view.","Forest economics; Nonmarket values; Optimal control of carbon sequestration; Political and distributional aspects of climate change","carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate change; conceptual framework; uncertainty; uncertainty issue; carbon dioxide measurement; economic aspect; forest; global climate; greenhouse effect; review; temperature measurement",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4",,,,"Chichilnisky, G., Heal, G., Global Environmental Risks (1993) Journal of Economic Perspectives, 7, pp. 65-86; Breton, A., Toward a Theory of Competitive Federalism (1987) European Journal of Political Economy, 3 (1-2), pp. 263-331; Breton, A., Scott, A., (1978) The Economic Constitution of Federal States, , Toronto: Univ. of Toronto Press; Burtraw, D., Toman, M.A., Containment, Equity and International Agreements for CO2 (1992) Journal of Energy Engineering, 118 (AUG), pp. 122-135; Von Ciriacy-Wantrup, S., (1968) Resource Conservation: Economics and Policies. 3rd Ed., , Berkeley CA: Univ. of California Division of Agricultural Sciences; Dixit, A., Pindyck, R.S., (1994) Investment under Uncertainty, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ.
