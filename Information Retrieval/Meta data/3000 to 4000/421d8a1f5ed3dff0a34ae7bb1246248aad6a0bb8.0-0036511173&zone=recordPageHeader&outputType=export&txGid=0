It is important to establish priorities for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, so that resources can be allocated efficiently and effectively. This is a global problem, and it is possible, on a global scale, to identify those activities whose emissions have the greatest potential for enhancing the greenhouse effect. However, perspectives from smaller scales must be appreciated, because it is on scales down to the local level that response measures will be implemented. This paper analyzes the relative importance of emissions from the many individual sources, on scales ranging from global to national to subnational. Individual country perspectives and proposed policy measures and those of subnational political entities exhibit some commonalities but differ among themselves and from a global-scale perspective in detail.","Emissions; Greenhouse gases","Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Public policy; Atmospheric concentrations; Gas emissions; emission inventory; greenhouse gas; international comparison; pollution monitoring; exhaust gas; global climate; government; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; policy; pollution control; resource allocation; review; scientific literature; air pollutant; air pollution; article; environmental monitoring; management; politics; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Greenhouse Effect; Policy Making; Politics; Public Policy",,"Air Pollutants",,,,"Adger, W.N., Brown, K., A UK greenhouse gas inventory: On estimating anthropogenic and natural sources and sinks (1993) Ambio, 22, pp. 509-517; Alber, S.C., (1997) Inventory of Hawaii Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Estimates for 1990, , Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism; Energy, Resources and Technology Division; and Department of Health, Clean Air Branch; Honolulu, Hawaii, 154 pp; Alber, S.C., Tantlinger, J., Kaya, M.H., (1998) Hawaii Climate Change Action Plan, , Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism; Energy, Resources and Technology Division; and Department of Health, Clean Air Branch; Honolulu, Hawaii, 364 pp; Bem, S., Wade, K., (1995) Indiana Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: Estimates for 1990, , Indiana Department of Environmental Management, Office of Air Management, Indianapolis, Indiana, 211 pp; Boden, T.A., Kaiser, D.P., Sepanski, R.J., Stoss, F.W., (1994) Trends 93: A Compendium of Data on Global Change, , ORNL/CDIAC-65.
