For example, the Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism announced the CASBEE-HI (Heat Island) assessment system in 2008 as a response to worsening urban warming and urban heat island effects. The Ministry implemented "" Building Space Greening Plans"" in Tokyo, Osaka, and other cities, enforcing by law the effective reduction of urban temperatures and improving urban living environments and alleviating the threat of urban ecological disasters. Therefore, this study integrates Taiwan domestic and foreign building space greening design, derived greening benefits, implementation promotion methods, and greening design policies as measurement constructs to examine the mutual influence between different constructs and to analyze the degree of influence on the urban real estate market.From the result, demonstrating that building space environment greening design does bring about positive benefits. In addition, the greening benefit was shown to have a positive impact on the urban real estate market. At the same time, greening promotion implementation method and urban policy standard both had a positive impact on the urban real estate market, demonstrating that government promotion of building environment greening design through urban design policy means is acceptable to the public. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Global warming; Greening design; Real estate market; Sustainable development; Urban policy","Assessment system; Building environment; Building spaces; CASBEE-HI; Dense urban areas; Design policy; Heat island; Implementation methods; Living environment; Real estate; Real estate market; Urban design; Urban heat island; Urban policy; Urban warming; Buildings; Commerce; Environmental protection; Global warming; Heat flux; Landforms; Strategic planning; Sustainable development; Urban planning; Design; global warming; greenspace; heat island; public space; sustainable development; urban design; urban planning; urban policy; Taiwan",,,,,,"Chang, K.F., The influence of the residential benefit of sustainable building on house-purchase choice (2008) Journal of Housing Studies, 17 (1), pp. 51-70. , [in Chinese]; Raymond, J.C., Building environmental assessment methods: redefining intentions and roles (2005) Building Research & Information, 35 (5), pp. 230-246; Thomas, L., David, L., Integrating sustainability into property risk assessments for market transformation (2007) Building Research & Information, 35 (6), pp. 644-661; (2006) CASBEE for heat island (CASBEE-HI), , http://www.ibec.or.jp/CASBEE/index.htm/, JaGBC & JSBC, Japan, Available from:, Japan GreenBuild Council and Japan Sustainable Building Consortium; Lin, H.T., Lu, K.M., Sun, C.Y., Application of satellite remote sensing and image classification techniques for estimating the percentage of or impervious surface area in urban areas - A Tainan city case study (2008) City and Planning, 35 (2), pp. 123-139. , [in Chinese]; Sun, C.Y., Lin, H.T., Annual variation of urban heat island intensity in the Tainan region (2006) City and Planning, 33 (1), pp. 51-68. , [in Chinese]; Murakami, S., (2006) Comprehensive assessment system for building environmental efficiency on heat island relaxation, , Department of Architecture & Building Science Tohoku University; Kenneth, I., Marta, L., Andrew, M., Shading performance of a vertical deciduous climbing plant canopy (2010) Building and Environment, 45 (2), pp. 81-88; Hsu, C.C., (2003) A research on the urban environmental greenery and permeable efficiency to effect of the micro climate - A case study of Hualien city, , National Dong Hwa University, Taiwan, [in Chinese]; Wong, N.H., Jusuf, S.K., La Win, A.A., Thu, H.K., Negara, T.S., Wu, X., Environmental study of the impact of greenery in an institutional campus in the tropics (2007) Building and Environment, 42, pp. 2949-2970; Wu, C.M., (2007) A study on the influence of parks on heat environment of blocks, , Graduate Institute of Architecture and Urban Design, Chaoyang University of Technology, Taiwan, [in Chinese]; Murakami, S., (2008), Market transformation brought about by the necessity for reducing environmental risks - CASBEE application to property appraisal for promoting low carbonization.
