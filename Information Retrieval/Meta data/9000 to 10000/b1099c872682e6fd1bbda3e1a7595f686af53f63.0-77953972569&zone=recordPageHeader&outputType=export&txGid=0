The second environmental problem is that during sewage sludge composting process global warming gases, such as CO2, CH4, and N2O are emitted, the emissions of these gases can be reduced by creating optimal composting conditions (C:N, aeration, pH and humidity) and by adding some additives (wood cuttings, shavings, zeolites, peat etc.) into sewage sludge. In our study we analyse the experimental results on CH4, NH3, H2S and VOC emissions during sewage sludge composting process. For this experiment, centrifuge-dried sewage sludge from Vilnius City Municipal Sewage Treatment Plant were used. Used Ashen bark, oaken cuttings, aspen shavings, shredded deciduous tree branches. The composting process was performed in a compost site-simulating facilities.","Composting; Gaseous pollutants; Odors; Sewage sludge; Wood waste","Composting conditions; Composting process; Deciduous trees; Dried sewage sludge; Environmental problems; Gaseous pollutants; Municipal sewage treatment plant; Organic matter decomposition; Sewage sludge treatment; VOC emissions; Wood cutting; Centrifugation; Composting; Fog; Global warming; Odors; Sewage sludge; Sewage treatment plants; Silicate minerals; Waste treatment; Wood products; Sewage aeration; Composting; Effluent Treatment; Fogging; Minerals; Odors; Sewage; Silicates; Sludge; Wood Products; Wood Waste",,,,,,"Ashbolt, N.J., Line, M.A., A bench-scale system to study the composting of organic wastes (1982) Journal of Environmental Quality, 11 (3), pp. 405-110; Baltrenas, P., Jankaite, A., Raistenskis, E., Experimental investigation of biodegradation processes in food waste (2005) Journal of Environmental Engineering and Landscape Management, 13 (4), pp. 167-177; Baltrenas, P., Raistenskis, E., Zigmontiene, A., Experimental investigation of biogas emissions during organic waste biodegradation processes (2004) Journal of Environmental Engineering and Landscape Management, 12 (1), pp. 3-9; Brown, S., Kruger, C., Subler, S., Greenhouse gas balance for composting operations (2008) Journal of Environmental Quality, 37 (4), pp. 1396-1410. , DOI 10.2134/jeq2007.0453; (2008) Greenhouse Gases and the Role of Composting: A Primer for Compost Producers., , http://www.compostingcouncil.org, Composting Council, US [cited on 12 November 2009].
