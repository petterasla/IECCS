Although meltwater (particularly glacier-fed) streams have received much attention in recent years, the influence of groundwater on alpine freshwater ecosystems remains poorly understood. This study tested the hypotheses that increased groundwater contributions to meltwater-dominated alpine streams would yield increases in water temperature, channel stability, electrical conductivity and particulate organic matter (POM) and decreases in suspended sediment concentration (SSC). These more favourable habitat conditions were hypothesised to result in increased macroinvertebrate abundance and diversity. Groundwater contributions, physicochemical habitat variables and benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled throughout the 2002 and 2003 summer-melt seasons in three streams in the French Pyrénées. Increased groundwater contributions were significantly correlated with higher discharge, water temperature, electrical conductivity, POM and channel stability, but lower SSC. Macroinvertebrate total abundance, taxonomic richness, number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera genera, and per cent Plecoptera all increased significantly with greater groundwater contributions to streamflow. However, beta diversity and Trichoptera relative abundance decreased. Abundance of most macroinvertebrate taxa was highest under groundwater-dominated conditions but a gradient of optimum groundwater preferences was evident across all taxa. Some taxa were found only where groundwater contributions were low (i.e. in predominantly meltwater-fed streams). This study provides evidence that water source, physicochemical habitat and stream biota are strongly linked. Therefore, an interdisciplinary approach is necessary for future studies aiming to develop conservation strategies or predict the response of alpine river ecosystems to global climate change. © 2007 The Authors, Journal compilation 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Confluence; French Pyrénées; Glacier; Macroinvertebrate; Tributary","Ephemeroptera; Plecoptera; Trichoptera",,,,,,"Benda, L., Poff, N.L., Miller, D.M., Dunne, T., Reeves, G.H., Pess, G., Pollock, M., The network dynamics hypothesis: How channel networks structure riverine habitats (2004) BioScience, 54, pp. 413-427; Borcard, D., Legendre, P., Drapeau, P., Partialling out the spatial component of ecological variation (1992) Ecology, 73, pp. 1045-1055; Brown, L.E., Hannah, D.M., Milner, A.M., Alpine stream habitat classification: An alternative approach incorporating the role of dynamic water source contributions (2003) Arctic Antarctic and Alpine Research, 35, pp. 313-322; Brown, L.E., Hannah, D.M., Milner, A.M., Spatial and temporal water column and streambed temperature dynamics within an alpine catchment: Implications for benthic communities (2005) Hydrological Processes, 19, pp. 1585-1610; Brown, L.E., Hannah, D.M., Milner, A.M., Hydroclimatological influences on water column and streambed temperature dynamics in an alpine river system (2006) Journal of Hydrology, 325, pp. 1-20; Brown, L.E., Hannah, D.M., Milner, A.M., Soulsby, C., Hodson, A., Brewer, M.J., Water source dynamics in an alpine glacierized river basin (Taillon-Gabiétous, French Pyrénées) (2006) Water Resources Research, 42, pp. W08404; Brown, L.E., Milner, A.M., Hannah, D.M., Stability and persistence of alpine stream macroinvertebrate communities and the role of physicochemical habitat variables (2006) Hydrobiologia, 560, pp. 159-173; Brown, L.E., Hannah, D.M., Milner, A.M., Vulnerability of alpine stream biodiversity to shrinking glaciers and snowpacks (2007) Global Change Biology; Füreder, L., High alpine streams as models for ecological gradients (1998) Hydrology, Water Resources and Ecology in Headwaters (Headwater 1998 Conference), 248, pp. 387-394. , Eds Kovar, K, Tappeiner, U, Peters, N.E. & Craig R.G, pp, IAHS Publication, Willingford, UK; Füreder, L., High alpine streams: Cold habitats for insect larvae (1999) Cold Adapted Organisms: Ecophysiology, Enzymology and Molecular Biology, pp. 181-196. , Eds R.
