Most of the major and trace elements exhibit significant fluctuations at glacial-interglacial scales, implying a close relation with regional and global climate change. Al-normalized elemental ratios can be subdivided into three principal components (PC). PC1 (e.g., Ca/Al, Ba/Al, Sr/Al) displays significant glacial-interglacial variation and is related to paleoproductivity in the northern SCS. PC2 (e.g., K/Al, Mg/Al, Rb/Al) is associated with the degree of chemical weathering in the source regions and shows little glacial-interglacial variation. PC3 (e.g., Ti/Al, Zr/Al) reflects the relative contribution of coarse- and fine-grained materials in the terrigenous components of the SCS sediments, likely associated with changes in sea level and monsoon-induced fluvial input. Spectral analyses indicate that paleoproductivity (i.e., Ba/Al) in the South China Sea lags Hulu/Sanbao speleothem δ18O record (an indicator of annual average meteoric precipitation) by 102° and Indian summer monsoon (multi-proxy stack) by 23° at the precession band, indicating a close relationship with the Indian summer monsoon. However, the chemical weathering degree in the source area (PC2) is not sensitive to monsoon-related changes at the precession band during the last climatic cycle. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.","East Asian monsoon; Elemental ratios; Major and trace elements; South China Sea","chemical composition; chemical weathering; glacial-interglacial cycle; paleoproductivity; sediment chemistry; terrigenous deposit; trace element; Pacific Ocean; South China Sea",,,,,,"An, Z.S., The history and variability of the East Asian paleomonsoon climate (2000) Quaternary Science Reviews, 19, pp. 171-187; Berger, A., Loutre, M.F., Insolation values for the climate of the last 10 million years (1991) Quaternary Science Reviews, 10, pp. 297-317; Boulay, S., Colin, C., Trentesaux, A., Frank, N., Liu, Z., Sediment sources and East Asian monsoon intensity over the last 450 ky.
