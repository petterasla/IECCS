Whether global air temperature will increase, by how much, and when, are subject to debate, but there is little doubt that tropospheric concentrations of several trace gases are increasing. While possible increases in the average air temperature is a product of these changes, the increases in the trace gases alone will have an effect on agriculture. Increases in the ambient concentrations of carbon dioxide are expected to have a positive net effect on crop production. In contrast, any increases in the penetration of surface-level ultraviolet-B (280-320 nm) radiation, and known increases in surface ozone concentrations, are considered to have adverse effects on certain crops. Our present knowledge of the joint effects on crops of elevated levels of carbon dioxide, ultraviolet-B radiation and ozone, and possible alterations in air temperature and precipitation patterns, is virtually zero. Therefore, any predictions of the effects of global climate change on agriculture are subject to significant uncertainties. In contrast, coupling of climate change (only temperature and precipitation) models to crop production has led to a number of future scenarios. In spite of their present limitations, results from these efforts can be useful in planning for future agriculture.","Crop effects; Global climate change; Processes; Products; Uncertainties","carbon dioxide; ozone; rain; agriculture; air temperature; conference paper; crop; global climate; greenhouse effect; nonhuman; troposphere; ultraviolet b radiation; Atmospheric composition; Carbon dioxide; Cultivation; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Ozone layer; Precipitation (meteorology); Ultraviolet radiation; Ultraviolet B radiation; Global warming; agricultural impact; carbon dioxide; climate change; crop production; global climate change; man-environment relations; ozone; ultraviolet radiation",,,,,,"Ashmore, M.R., Bell, J.N.B., The Role of Ozone in Global Change (1991) Ann.
