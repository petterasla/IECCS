Temperature, organic carbon and oxygen consumption were measured over a year at 13 sites in four lowlands streams within the same region in North Zealand, Denmark with the objectives of determining: (i) spatial and seasonal differences between open streams, forest streams and streams with or without lakes, (ii) factors influencing the temperature dependence of oxygen consumption rate, (iii) consequences of higher temperature and organic content in lake outlets on oxygen consumption rate, and (iv) possible consequences of forecasted global warming on degradation of organic matter. 2. High concentrations of easily degradable dissolved (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) were found in open streams downstream of plankton-rich lakes, while high concentrations of recalcitrant DOC were found in a forest brook draining a forest swamp. Concentrations of predominantly recalcitrant POC and DOC were low in a groundwater-fed forest spring. Overall, DOC concentration was two to 18 times higher than POC concentrations. 3. Oxygen consumption rate at 20°C was higher during summer than winter, higher in open than shaded streams and higher in lake outlets than inlets. Rate was closely related to concentrations of chlorophyll and POC but not to DOC. The ratio of oxygen consumption rate to total organic concentrations (DOC + POC), serving as a measure of organic degradability, was highest downstream of lakes, intermediate in open streams and lowest in forest streams. 4. Temperature coefficients describing the exponential increase of oxygen consumption rate between 4 and 20°C averaged 0.121°C-1 (Q10 of 3.35) in 70 measurements and showed no significant variations between seasons and stream sites or correlations with ambient temperature and organic content. 5. Oxygen consumption rate was enhanced downstream of lakes during summer because of higher temperature and, more significantly, greater concentrations of degradable organic carbon. Oxygen consumption rates were up to seven times higher in the stream with three impoundments than in a neighbouring unshaded stream and 21 times higher than in the groundwater-fed forest spring. 6. A regional climate model has calculated a dramatic 4-5°C rise in air temperature over Denmark by 2070-2100. If this is realised, unshaded streams are estimated to become 2-3°C warmer in summer and winter and 5-7°C warmer in spring and, thereby, increase oxygen consumption rates at ambient temperature by 30-40% and 80-130%, respectively. Faster consumption of organic matter and dissolved oxygen downstream of point sources should increase the likelihood of oxygen stress of the stream biota and lead to the export of less organic matter but more mineralised nutrients to the coastal waters. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Climate model; Lowland streams; Organic carbon; Oxygen consumption; Temperature","biota; environmental factor; global warming; lake ecosystem; organic carbon; organic matter; oxygen consumption; plankton; spring water; water temperature; Denmark; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Zealand",,,,,,"Allan, J.D., (1995) Stream Ecology, Structure and Function of Running Waters, , Chapman and Hall, London; Butturini, A., Sabater, F., Seasonal variability of dissolved organic carbon in a Midditerranean stream (2000) Biogeochemistry, 51, pp. 303-321; Christensen, J.H., Carter, T., Giorgi, F., PRUDENCE employs new methods to assess European climate change (2002) Eos, 83, pp. 1537-1544; (2002) The Biology of Streams and Rivers., , http://www.frederiksborgamt.dk, Frederiksborg County (Vandmiljøovervågning no. 92.
