Although wind generation does not itself produce any harmful emissions, its effect on power system operation can actually cause an increase in the emissions of conventional plants. A dispatch model was developed that analyzes the impact that wind generation has on the operation of conventional plants and the resulting emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), and oxides of nitrogen (NOx). The analysis concentrates on a ""forecasted"" approach that incorporates wind generation forecasts in the dispatch decisions. It was found that wind generation could be used as a tool for reducing CO2 emissions but alone, it was not effective in curbing SO2 and NOx emissions. © 2005 IEEE.","Emission; Environmental factors; Power system economics; Wind power generation","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Electric power systems; Industrial emissions; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur dioxide; Emissions reduction; Environmental factors; Power system economics; Power system operation; Wind power generation; Wind power",,,,,,"(2001), http://www.europa.eu.int/scadplus/Ieg/en/lvb/127035.htm, The Promotion of Electricity Produced from Renewable Energy Sources in the Internal Electricity Market, Directive 2001/77/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council.
