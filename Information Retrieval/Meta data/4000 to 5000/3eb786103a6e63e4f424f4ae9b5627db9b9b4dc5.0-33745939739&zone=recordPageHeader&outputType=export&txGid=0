Here, we present an acid digestion method optimised for cleanliness and maximum lipid recovery. The use of acid digestion and hydrolysis improves lipid yields not only by releasing organic matter trapped within individual calcite crystals, but also by allowing access to the chemically-bound pool of lipids, particularly acidic compounds such as alkanoic acids, hydroxy acids, and alkanedioic acids. The technique also considerably reduces contamination problems in comparison to conventional soxhlet extraction. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
