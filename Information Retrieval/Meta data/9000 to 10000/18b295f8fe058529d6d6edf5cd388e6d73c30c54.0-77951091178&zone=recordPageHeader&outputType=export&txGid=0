In the context of global climate change, amphibians are of particular interest because of their extreme sensitivity to the variation of temperature and precipitation regimes. We analyzed species-climate relationships for 17 amphibian species occurring in Italy using species distribution data at the 10 × 10 km resolution. A machine learning method, Random Forests, was used to model the distribution of amphibians in relation to a set of 18 climatic variables. The results showed that the variables which had the highest importance were those related to precipitation, indicating that precipitation is an important factor in determining amphibian distribution. Future projections showed a complex response of species distributions, emphasizing the potential severity of climate change on the distributions of amphibians in Italy. The species that will decrease the most are those occurring in mountainous and Mediterranean areas. Our results provide some preliminary information that could be useful for amphibian conservation, indicating if future conservation priorities for some species should be enhanced. © The Ecological Society of Japan 2009.","Amphibians; Climate change; Distribution; Italy; Random Forests","amphibian; climate change; climate modeling; ecological approach; geographical distribution; population distribution; precipitation (climatology); species diversity; temperature gradient; Italy; Amphibia; Animalia",,,,,,"Alford, R.A., Richards, S.J., Global amphibian declines: A problem in applied ecology (1999) Annu Rev Ecol Syst, 30, pp. 133-165; Araujo, M.B., Luoto, M., The importance of biotic interactions for modelling species distributions under climate change (2007) Glob Ecol Biogeogr, 16, pp. 743-753; Araujo, M.B., Pearson, R.G., Thuiller, W., Erhard, M., Validation of species-climate impact models under climate change (2005) Glob Chang Biol, 11, pp. 1504-1513; Araujo, M.B., Thuiller, W., Pearson, R.G., Climate warming and the decline of amphibians and reptiles in Europe (2006) J Biogeogr, 33, pp. 1712-1728; 2004 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (2004) A Global Species Assessment, p. 191. , http://www.redlist.org, Baillie JEM, Hilton-Taylor C, Stuart SN (eds), IUCN, Gland, Switzerland and Cambridge, UK xxiv+; Battisti, C., Testi, A., Patterns of landbird species composition in Italy: A chorological approach focusing on trends and contra-trends along the peninsula (2003) J Mediterr Ecol, 4, pp. 5-21; Blaustein, A.R., Belden, L.K., Olson, D.H., Green, D.M., Root, T.L., Kiesecker, J.M., Amphibian breeding and climate change (2001) Conserv Biol, 15, pp. 1804-1809; Boone, M.D., Semlitsch, R.D., Little, E.E., Doyle, M.C., Multiple stressors in amphibian communities: Effects of chemical contamination, bullfrogs, and fish (2007) Ecol Appl, 17, pp. 291-301; Breiman, L., Random Forests (2001) Mach Learn, 45, pp. 5-32; Breiman, L., Freidman, J., Olshen, R., Stone, C., (1984) Classification and Regression Trees, p. 358. , Wadsworth, Belmont; Brooker, R.W., Travis, J.M.J., Clark, E.J., Dytham, C., Modelling species' range shifts in a changing climate: The impacts of biotic interactions, dispersal distance and the rate of climate change (2007) J Theor Biol, 245, pp. 59-65; Carey, C., Alexander, M.A., Climate change and amphibian declines: Is there a link?
