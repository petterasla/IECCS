This paper presents an analysis of the linkages between the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis first version of the Canadian Global Coupled Model (CCCma CGCMI) 2000 model output and local/regional precipitation time series. The GCM 500 hPa geopotential heights were visually classified for synoptic patterns using a geographical information system. The pattern frequencies were statistically compared with historical data from Changnon et al. (1993. Monthly Weather Review 121: 633-647) for the winter period 1961-85. The CGCMI synoptic frequencies compare favourably with the historical data, and they represent a substantial improvement over the 1992 Canadian Climate Centre Global Circulation Model synoptic climatology output. The CGCMI output was used to forecast future winter precipitation scenarios for five geographically diverse climate stations in western North America.
