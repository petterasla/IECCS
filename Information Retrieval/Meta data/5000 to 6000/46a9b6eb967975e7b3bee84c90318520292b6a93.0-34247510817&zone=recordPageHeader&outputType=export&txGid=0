Because oak seeds are heavy, most germinate under parent trees where they compete for light and water. Animals disperse acorns to more distant sites, often in shrublands, contributing to the expansion of oak woodlands. While dispersed seeds escape from competition, they may lack access to mycorrhizal inoculum or to the common mycorrhizal network of oak woodlands. The purpose of this study was to determine whether small mammals eat hypogeous sporocarps and defecate fungal spores thus dispersing mycorrhizal inoculum in oak woodlands. Mycorrhizal fungi, particularly truffles, are not ""everywhere"" because they are obligately mycorrhizal on trees. In addition, hypogeous fungi remain below ground and do not release spores into the air, further inhibiting dispersal of inoculum. We collected 21 species of hypogeous fungi near Oregon white oaks and confirmed the mycorrhizal status of six species. We set live traps and captured three species of rodents, Microtus californicus, Pemmyscus maniculatus, and Reithrodontomys megalotis. Spores of twelve species of hypogeous fungi were in their fecal pellets. The diets of these small mammals differed in fungal composition indicating unique foraging strategies. We found that mycorrhizal communities on Oregon white oak saplings located in buck brush shrublands at distances away from mature trees included hypogeous species suggesting that small mammals disperse spores for mycorrhizal inoculum. Dispersal of mycorrhizal inoculum is an important consideration in restoration of oak habitats, in natural regeneration of oak communities, and in their possibilities for range expansion with global warming. © 2006 by the Northwest Scientific Association.
