Field measurements were carried out from June 2002 to May 2003. GHG fluxes were measured in a closed chamber. Soil respiration was measured in the SW and WW fields, and photosynthetic CO2 flux during the daytime (net ecosystem production, NEPday) was measured in the PF field. Microbial respiration (R m) in the SW and WW fields was approximated as 60% of the total soil respiration. NEP was calculated as the difference between plant dry matter (net primary production, NPP) and Rm. Aboveground plant parts were collected from each field to calculate NPP of each crop. Rm in the PF field was calculated as 3/2NPP - NEPday, because aboveground respiration is 50% of NPP. The global warming potential (GWP) in each ecosystem was calculated using a 100-year time horizon, as recommended by the IPCC (with factors of 21 for CH4 and 310 for N2O). Rm, was 682 g C m-2 y-1 in PF, 533 in SW, and 388 in WW. NPP was 651, 397, and 152 g C m-2 y-1, respectively. Therefore, NEP was -31, -136, and -236 g C m-2 y-1, respectively. The PF field acted as a large CH4 source (85.2 g C m-2 y -1) because of flooding. The WW field was a small source of CH 4 (0.16 g C m-2 y-1), and the SW field was a small sink (0.14 g C m-2 y-1). All fields were sources of N2O (1.36 g N m-2 y-1 in SW, 0.60 in WW, and 0.05 in PF). The rate of mineralization was higher than the rate of N fertilizer application in SW and WW. The GWP was equivalent to 2522 g CO2 m-2 y-1 in the PF field, 1161 g CO2 m -2 y-1 in the WW field, and 1157 g CO2 m -2 y-1 in the SW field. The high value in the PF field was due to high CH4 emissions there.","Global warming potential; Net ecosystem production; Net primary production","Glycine max; Triticum aestivum",,,,,,"Crill, P.M., Bartlett, K.B., Roulet, N., Methane flux from boreal peatlands (1993) Suo., 43, pp. 173-182; Hu, R., Hatano, R., Kusa, K., Sawamoto, T., Soil respiration and net ecosystem production in an onion field in central Hokkaido, Japan (2004) Soil Sci.
