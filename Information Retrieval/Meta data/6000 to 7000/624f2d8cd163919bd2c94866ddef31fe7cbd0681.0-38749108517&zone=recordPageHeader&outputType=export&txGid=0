In the growth chambers, natural conditions of the Maoershan mountain regions of Heilongjiang Province (45-46°N, 127-128°E) of China for the average growth season were simulated. The results showed that the maximum net photosynthetic rate (P Nmax) was ≈ 1.64 times greater at elevated temperature than at ambient temperature. The irradiance saturation point (I s), apparent quantum yield (AQY), maximum photosystem II efficiency (F v/F m), and chlorophyll content significantly increased, while irradiance compensation point (I c) was not affected by elevated temperature. The combination of elevated [CO2] and temperature also significantly increased P Nmax by approximately 34% but much lower than that under elevated temperature only. In the case of factor combination, dark respiration (R d), I c, F v/F m, and total chlorophyll content increased significantly, while I s and AQY were not affected. Moreover, under elevated [CO 2] and temperature, R d and I c, F v/F m were significantly higher than under elevated temperature only. The results indicated that the combination of elevated [CO2] and temperature expected in connection with the further global climate change may affect carbon storage of the coenotype of Q. mongolica in this region of China. © 2008 MAIK Nauka.","Chlorophyll a fluorescence; Chlorophyll content; Elevated [CO2] and temperature; Photosynthesis; Quercus mongolica","Quercus mongolica",,,,,,"Woodward, F.L., Potential Impacts of Global Elevated CO2 Concentrations on Plants (2002) Curr.
