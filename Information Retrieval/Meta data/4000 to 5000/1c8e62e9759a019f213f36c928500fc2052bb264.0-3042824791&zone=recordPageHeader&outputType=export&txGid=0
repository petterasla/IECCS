Rising atmospheric CO2 is found to contribute 20% to the precipitation reduction through the physiological forcing of stomatal closure, with 80% of the reduction being seen when stomatal closure was excluded and only radiative forcing by CO2 was included. The forest dieback exerts two positive feedbacks on the precipitation reduction; a biogeophysical feedback through reduced forest cover suppressing local evaporative water recycling, and a biogeochemical feedback through the release of CO2 contributing to an accelerated global warming. The precipitation reduction is enhanced by 20% by the biogeophysical feedback, and 5% by the carbon cycle feedback from the forest dieback. This analysis helps to explain why the Amazonian precipitation reduction simulated by HadCM3LC is more extreme than that simulated in other GCMs; in the fully-coupled, climate-carbon cycle simulation, approximately half of the precipitation reduction in Amazonia is attributable to a combination of physiological forcing and biogeophysical and global carbon cycle feedbacks, which are generally not included in other GCM simulations of future climate change. The analysis also demonstrates the potential contribution of regional-scale climate and ecosystem change to uncertainties in global CO2 and climate change projections. Moreover, the importance of feedbacks suggests that a human-induced increase in forest vulnerability to climate change may have implications for regional and global scale climate sensitivity. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",,"atmosphere-biosphere interaction; carbon dioxide enrichment; climate change; climate modeling; dieback; global warming; precipitation (climatology); rainforest; Amazonia; South America",,,,,,"Betts, R.A., (1998) Modelling the Influence of the Vegetated Land Surface on Climate and Climate Change, , PhD thesis, University of Reading, UK; Betts, R.A., Cox, P.M., Lee, S.E., Woodward, F.I., Contrasting physiological and structural vegetation feedbacks in climate change simulations (1997) Nature, 387, pp. 796-799; Cai, W., Whetton, P.H., A time-varying greenhouse warming pattern and the tropical-extratropical circulation linkage in the Pacific Ocean (2001) J Clim, 14, pp. 3337-3355; Charney, J.G., Dynamics of deserts and droughts in the Sahel (1975) Quart J Roy Meteor Soc, 101, pp. 193-202; Cox, P.M., Betts, R.A., Jones, C.D., Spall, S.A., Totterdell, I.J., Acceleration of global warming due to carbon-cycle feedbacks in a coupled climate model (2000) Nature, 408, pp. 184-187; Cox, P.M., (2001) Description of the TRIFFID Dynamic Global Vegetation Model, , Technical Note 24, Hadley Centre, Met Office; Cox, P.M., Betts, R.A., Collins, M., Harris, P., Huntingford, C., Jones, C.D., Amazonian dieback under climate-carbon cycle projections for the 21st century (2004) Theor Appl Climatol, , this issue; Essery, R.L.H., Best, M.J., Betts, R.A., Cox, P.M., Taylor, C.M., Explicit representation of subgrid heterogeneity in a GCM land-surface scheme (2003) J Hydromet, 4, pp. 530-543; Field, C., Jackson, R., Mooney, H., Stomatal responses to increased CO2: Implications from the plant to the global scale (1995) Plant, Cell Environ, 18, pp. 1214-1255; Gordon, C., Cooper, C., Senior, C.A., Banks, H., Gregory, J.M., Johns, T.C., Mitchell, J.F.B., Wood, R.A., The simulation of SST, sea ice extents and ocean heat transports in a version of the Hadley Centre coupled model without flux adjustments (2000) Clim Dyn, 16, pp. 147-168; Harris, P.P., Huntingford, C., Gash, J.H.G., Hodnett, M., Cox, P.M., Malli, Y., Aranjo, A.C., Calibration of a land-surface model using data from primary forest sites in Amazonia (2004) Theor Appl Climatol, , this issue; (2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis, p. 881. , IPCC Contribution of Working Group I to the Third Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
