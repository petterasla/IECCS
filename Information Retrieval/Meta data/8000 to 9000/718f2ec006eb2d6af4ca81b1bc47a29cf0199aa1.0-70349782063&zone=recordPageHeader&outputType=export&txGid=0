Soil organic carbon models that provide reliable predictions of SOC change in response to changing management, vegetation, and climatic conditions can serve as useful tools for developing and assessing land management practices that improve soil quality and sustainability and promote soil carbon sequestration. Most models of SOC dynamics based on the concepts of homogeneous SOC compartments face the problem of disconnection between conceptual kinetic SOC compartments and measurable SOC fractions. In addition, most kinetic parameters cannot be determined experimentally for specific site and soil conditions. Feng (2009) developed a new theoretical framework of SOC dynamics based on three fundamental assumptions: the possibility of steady state, linearity, and rate-time equivalence. A single SOC decomposition function, the R function, forms the basis of SOC prediction. This article develops the mathematical theory of a process-based, continuous model (K-model) of the R function. The model is developed by considering three basic steps in SOC decomposition: the initial decomposition of plant litter and utilization of its carbon by soil microorganisms, death of microorganisms, and decomposition and recycling of dead microbial residues. Death of microorganisms and subsequent decomposition of the dead microbial residue form a continuous cycle (the MD cycle) that leads to stabilization of C in soils. The model identifies a specific set of parameters that can be determined experimentally, making possible for site-specific parameterization and simulation. © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.","Decomposition; K-model; Model; SOC; SOC dynamics; Soil organic carbon","assessment method; climate change; decomposition analysis; future prospect; global climate; kinetics; land management; litter; organic carbon; recycling; soil microorganism; soil organic matter; soil quality; sustainability",,,,,,"Agren, I.G., Bosatta, E., (1996) Theoretical Ecosystem Ecology: Understanding Element Cycles, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK; Amundson, R., The carbon budget in soils (2001) Annu.
