It considers the effects of global warming, and the costs and benefits of action to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. The overall case for such action rests on the choice of discount rate. The paper considers the relative effectiveness of taxes and regulations in controlling emissions from the transport sector, and contrasts direct action on road traffic with indirect action via policies to increase travel on public transport. After a brief mention of the issue of biodiversity, the paper concludes with some reflections on the political acceptability of different policies.","Biodiversity; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Regulations; Taxes; Transport policy; Vehicle emissions","Air pollution control; Environmental impact; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Laws and legislation; Public policy; Street traffic control; Taxation; Biodiversity; Greenhouse gases; Public transport; Motor transportation",,,,,,"Acutt, M.Z., Modelling greenhouse gas emissions from cars in Great Britain (1996) Transportation Planning and Technology, 19, pp. 191-206; Acutt, M.Z., Dodgson, J.S., A price-sensitive model for forecasting car emissions (1994) Universities Transport Study Group Annual Conference, , University of Leeds; Acutt, M.Z., Dodgson, J.S., Multi-modal national traffic forecasts (1994) Transportation Methods, 1. , Proceedings of Seminar G, PTRC 22nd European Transport Forum, University of Warwick; Acutt, M.Z., Dodgson, J.S., Cross-elasticities of demand for travel (1996) Transport Policy, 2 (4), pp. 271-277; Barker, T., Baylis, S., Bryden, C., Achieving the Rio target: CO 2 abatement through fiscal policy in the UK (1994) Fiscal Studies, 15 (3), pp. 1-18; Birdsall, N., Steer, Act now on global wanning - But don't cook the books (1993) Finance and Development, pp. 6-8. , March; Catchpole, C.K., Phillips, J.F., Territorial quality and reproductive success in the Dartford warbler Sylvia undata in Dorset, England (1992) Biological Conservation, 61, pp. 209-215; Cline, W.R., (1992) The Economics of Global Warming, , Institute for International Economics, Washington DC; Cline, W.R., Give greenhouse abatement a fair chance (1993) Finance and Development, pp. 3-5. , March; (1989) National Road Traffic Forecasts (Great Britain) 1989, , HMSO, London; (1994) Transport Statistics Great Britain 1994, , HMSO, London; Eggleston, H.S., (1992) Pollution in the Atmosphere: Future Emissions from the UK, , Warren Spring Laboratory, Stevenage; Fankhauser, S., (1994) The Economic Costs of Global Warming Damage: A Survey, , University of Birmingham, Department of Economics Discussion Paper No. 94-04; Fankhauser, S., (1995) Valuing Climate Change: the Economics of the Greenhouse Effect, , Earthscan, London; Government, H.M., (1994) Climate Change: the UK Programme, , HMSO, London; Maddison, A., (1991) Dynamic Forces in Capitalist Development: A Long-Run Comparative View, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Nash, C.A., The age of the train?
