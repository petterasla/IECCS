The first step was to identify the major anthropogenic sources of VOC emissions in the United States and to group these sources into 28 general source groups. Emission factors for these source groups were then developed using different techniques and data bases. Multiplication of these emission factors by production/consumption statistics for other countries yielded global VOC emission estimates for specific source groups within those countries. The final step in development of the VOC inventory was to distribute emissions into 10° by 10° grid cells using detailed maps of population and industrial activity. The results of this study show total global anthropogenic VOC emissions of about 110 000 Gg/yr. The study identifies the United States as the largest emitter (21% of the total global VOC), followed by the (former) USSR, China, India and Japan. -Authors",,"anthropogenic source; emission; global inventory; volatile organic compound",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01480227,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027039779
