Both cases reveal how financial conflicts of interest can skew biomedical research. Such conflicts also occur in electric-utility-related research. Attempting to show that increased atomic energy can help address climate change, some industry advocates claim nuclear power is an inexpensive way to generate low-carbon electricity. Surveying 30 recent nuclear analyses, this paper shows that industry-funded studies appear to fall into conflicts of interest and to illegitimately trim cost data in several main ways. They exclude costs of full-liability insurance, underestimate interest rates and construction times by using ""overnight"" costs, and overestimate load factors and reactor lifetimes. If these trimmed costs are included, nuclear-generated electricity can be shown roughly 6 times more expensive than most studies claim. After answering four objections, the paper concludes that, although there may be reasons to use reactors to address climate change, economics does not appear to be one of them. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Atomic energy; Climate change; Conflicts of interest; Data-trimming; Economics; Electricity; Energy; Global warming; Greenhouse-gas emissions; Nuclear power; Renewable; Solar photovoltaic; Wind","article; business ethics; climate change; conflict of interest; economics; nuclear power plant; research ethics; scientific misconduct; Climate Change; Conflict of Interest; Ethics, Business; Ethics, Research; Nuclear Power Plants; Scientific Misconduct",,,,,,"Aabakken, J., (2005) Power Technologies Energy Data Book: Third Edition, , (37, 39), Golden, CO: US DOE, National Renewable Energies Lab; (2009) Standards of conduct, , http://www/abet.org/code.shtml, Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), Baltimore: ABET, Accessed 1 Oct 2009; (2005) The Price-Anderson Act: Background Information, , American Nuclear Society (ANS)(Nov), La Grange Park, IL: ANS; Ansolabehere, S.D., Deutsch, J., Driscoll, M., Gray, P.E., Holdren, J.P., Joskow, P.L., Lester, R.K., Beckjord, E.S., (2003) The Future of Nuclear Power, , Cambridge: MIT Press; (2000) Bank policy initiatives for the energy sector, , www.adb.org/work/policies/energy/energy.doc, Asian Development Bank, (February, p. 10, par. 25), Accessed 1 Nov 2008; (2000) Japanese Energy Security and Changing Global Energy Markets, , Baker Institute for Public Policy, Houston, TX: Rice University; Berry, R.S., (2007) Tomorrow's nuclear power will be different than yesterday's nuclear power, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Roundtable on Nuclear Power and Climate Change, , www.thebulletin.org/roundtable/nuclear-power-climate-change/, Accessed 9 Nov 2008; Beutier, D., (2005) EPR [European Pressurized Water Reactor] Background and Its Role in Continental Europe, , Paris: Areva Corporate Strategy Department; Bird, S.J., Spier, R.E., The complexity of competing and conflicting interests (2005) Science and Engineering Ethics, 11 (4), pp. 515-517; Bird, S.J., Spier, R.E., A conflict of interest disclosure policy (2008) Science and Engineering Ethics, 14, pp. 149-152; Blair, B., Public citizen takes on big oil, battles to reduce consumption, increase fuel economy (2008) Public Citizen News, 10, p. 10. , Jan/Feb; Brown, P., (2008) Voodoo Economics and the Doomed Nuclear Renaissance, , Cambridge/London: Wolfson College, Cambridge University/Friends of the Earth; Brownstein, B.P., (1994) The Price-Anderson act, , Cato Policy Analysis No. 36.
