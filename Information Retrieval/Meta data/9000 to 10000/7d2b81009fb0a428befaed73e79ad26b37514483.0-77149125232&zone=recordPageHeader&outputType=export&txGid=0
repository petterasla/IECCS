We find that conflict was more intense during colder period, just like Zhang et al. (Clim Change 76:459-477, 2006) found for China. This relationship weakens in the industrialized era, and is not robust to the details of the climate reconstruction or to the sample period. As the correlation is negative and weakening, it appears that global warming would not lead to an increase in violent conflict in temperature climates. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2009.",,"Climate reconstruction; Temperature climate; Global warming; conflict management; correlation; global warming; paleoclimate; paleotemperature; precipitation intensity; reconstruction; temperature effect; violence; Europe",,,,,,"Alesina, A., Spolaore, E., (2005) The Size of Nations, , Cambridge: MIT; Atwell, W.S., Volcanism and short-term climatic change in East Asian and World history, c. 1200-1699 (2001) J World Hist, 12 (1), pp. 29-98; Barnett, J., Climate change, insecurity and injustice (2006) Fairness in Adaptation to Climate Change, pp. 115-130. , W.
