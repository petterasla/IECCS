Changes in the DMS flux to the atmosphere cause changes to aerosols for cloud formation, leading to changes in the amount of radiation reaching the ocean, and hence on the planktonic production of DMS. This hypothesis has been investigated using a coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model (COAGCM) that includes an ocean ecosystem model and an atmospheric sulphur cycle. Ocean DMS concentrations are parameterised as a function of chlorophyll, nutrient, and light. The results of several sensitivity experiments are presented showing significant global climate change responses to perturbations in ocean DMS production. A small negative feedback from climate change onto ocean DMS production is found and the implications are discussed.",,"Atmospheric aerosols; Climate change; Clouds; Computer simulation; Marine biology; Mathematical models; Climate sensitivity; Cloud formation; Dimethylsulphide (DMS); General circulation model; Ocean phytoplankton; Oceanography; aerosol; climate change; dimethylsulfide; global climate; phytoplankton; volcanic cloud",,,,,,"Anderson, T.R., Plankton functional type modelling: Running before we can walk?
