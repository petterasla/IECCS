Changes in the size of these pools and redistribution among them in response to global warming may considerably affect the long-term terrestrial C and N storage. However, such changes have not been carefully examined in field warming experiments. This study used sulfuric acid hydrolysis to quantify changes in labile and recalcitrant C and N fractions of soil in a tallgrass prairie ecosystem that had been continuously warmed with or without clipping for about 2.5 years. Warming significantly increased labile C and N fractions in the unclipped plots, resulting in increments of 373 mg C kg-1 dry soil and 15 mg N kg-1 dry soil, over this period whilst clipping significantly decreased such concentrations in the warmed plots. Warming also significantly increased soil microbial biomass C and N in the unclipped plots, and increased ratios of soil microbial/labile C and N, indicating an increase in microbial C- and N-use efficiency. Recalcitrant and total C and N contents were not significantly affected by warming. For all measured pools, only labile and microbial biomass C fractions showed significant interactions between warming and clipping, indicating the dependence of the warming effects on clipping. Our results suggest that increased soil labile and microbial C and N fractions likely resulted indirectly from warming increases in plant biomass input, which may be larger than warming-enhanced decomposition of labile organic compounds.","Clipping; Labile C and N; Microbial biomass; Recalcitrant; tallgrass prairie; Warming","Biological materials; Biomass; Global warming; Lakes; Magnesium printing plates; Organic compounds; Renewable energy resources; Sulfuric acid; Clipping; Labile C and N; Microbial biomass; Recalcitrant; tallgrass prairie; Warming; Soils; biomass; carbon; clipping; concentration (composition); global warming; grass; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; prairie; Great Plains; North America",,,,,,"Amundson, R., The carbon budget in soils (2001) Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences, 29, pp. 535-562; An, Y., Wan, S., Zhou, X., Subeda, A.A., Wallace, L.L., Luo, Y., Plant nitrogen concentration, use efficiency, and contents in a tallgrass prairie ecosystem under experimental warming (2005) Global Change Biology, 11, pp. 1733-1744; Brookes, P.C., Landman, A., Pruden, G., Jenkinson, D.S., Chloroform fumigation and the release of soil nitrogen: a rapid direct extraction method to measure microbial biomass nitrogen in soil (1985) Soil Biology and Biochemistry, 17, pp. 837-842; Cambardella, C.A., Elliott, E.T., Particulate soil organic matter changes across a grassland cultivation sequence (1992) Soil Science Society of America Journal, 56, pp. 777-783; Carter, M.R., Microbial biomass as an index for tillage-induced changes in soil biological properties (1986) Soil and Tillage Research, 7, pp. 29-40; Davidson, E.A., Janssens, I.A., Temperature sensitivity of soil carbon decomposition and feedbacks to climate change (2006) Nature, 440, pp. 165-173; Degens, B.P., Microbial functional diversity can be influenced by the addition of simple organic substrates to soil (1998) Soil Biology and Biochemistry, 30, pp. 1981-1988; Fang, C., Smith, P., Moncrieff, J.B., Smith, J.U., Similar response of labile and resistant soil organic matter pools to changes in temperature (2005) Nature, 433, pp. 57-59; Hobbie, S.E., Temperature and plant species control over litter decomposition in Alaskan tundra (1996) Ecological Monographs, 66, pp. 503-522; Holland, E.A., Coleman, D.C., Litter placement effects on microbial and organic matter dynamics in an ecosystem (1987) Ecology, 68, pp. 425-433; Hu, S., Coleman, D.C., Carroll, C.R., Hendrix, P.F., Beare, M.H., Labile soil carbon pools in subtropical forest and agricultural ecosystems as influenced by management practices and vegetation types.
