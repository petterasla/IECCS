The purpose of this interdisciplinary research project is to assess the dynamics and coupling of marine and terrestrial ecosystems in relation to global climate variability. Preliminary data about the research cruises from the R/V ""Italica"" and R/V ""Tangaroa"" along the Victoria Land Coast in 2004 are presented. As a global climate barometer, this research along Victoria Land provides a unique framework for assessing latitudinal shifts in 'sentinel' environmental transition zones, where climate changes have an amplified impact on the phases of water.","Antarctic; Global climate change; Interdisciplinary cooperation; Latitudinal Gradient Project; Victoria Land","climate change; coupling; global change; latitudinal gradient; Antarctica; East Antarctica; Victoria Land",,,,,,"Arntz, W.E., Magellan-Antarctic: Ecosystems that drifted apart.
