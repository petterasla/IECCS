Driven by anthropogenic activities, it is known to be a direct threat to our food and water supplies and an indirect threat to world security. Increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will certainly affect hydrological regimes. The consequent global warming is expected to have major implications on water resources management. The objective of this research is to present a general approach for evaluating the impacts of potential climate change on streamflow in a river basin in the humid tropical zone of India. Large-scale global climate models (GCMs) are the best available tools to provide estimates of the effect of rising greenhouse gases on rainfall and temperature. However the spatial resolution of these models (250 km×250 km) is not compatible with that of watershed hydrological models. Hence the outputs from GCMs have to be downscaled using regional climate models (RCMs), so as to project the output of a GCM to a finer resolution (50 km×50 km). In the present work, the projections of a GCM for two scenarios, A2 and B2 are downscaled by a RCM to project future climate in a watershed. Projections for two important climate variables, viz. rainfall and temperature are made. These are then used as inputs for a physically-based hydrological model, SWAT, in order to evaluate the effect of climate change on streamflow and vegetative growth in a humid tropical watershed. © 2011 IAHS Press.","Climate change; Downscaling; Humid tropics; India; Regional climate model; SWAT model","Down-scaling; Humid tropics; India; Regional climate models; SWAT model; Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Landforms; Rain; Stream flow; Tropics; Water resources; Water supply; Watersheds; Climate models; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; downscaling; global warming; humid tropics; precipitation assessment; precipitation intensity; rainfall; streamflow; vegetation cover; water resource; India",,,,,,"Alansi, A.W., Validation of SWAT model for stream flow simulation and forecasting in Upper Bernam humid tropical river basin.
