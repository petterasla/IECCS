Results from the testing showed that some stoves currently used in the field have improved fuel efficiency and lower pollutant emissions compared with traditional cooking methods. Stoves with smaller-mass components exposed to the heat of fuel combustion tended to take lesser time to boil, have better fuel efficiency, and lower pollutant emissions. The challenge is to design stoves with smaller-mass components that also have acceptable durability, affordable cost, and meet user needs. Results from this study provide stove performance and emissions information to practitioners disseminating stove technology in the field. This information may be useful for improving the design of existing stoves and for developing new stove designs. Comparison of results between laboratories shows that results can be replicated between labs when the same stove and fuel are tested using the WBT protocol. Recommendations were provided to improve the ability to replicate results between labs. Implications of better solid-fuel cook stoves are improved human health, reduced fuel use, reduced deforestation, and reduced global climate change.","CO; CO2; Fuel wood; Garment waste; Lump charcoal; Partnership for Clean Indoor Air; PCIA; PM2.5; Total hydrocarbon; Water Boiling Test","Carbon; Charcoal; Climate change; Climatology; Deforestation; Fuels; Hydrocarbons; Indoor air pollution; Leakage (fluid); Mergers and acquisitions; Organic compounds; Permanent magnets; Waste incineration; CO; CO<sub>2</sub>; Fuel wood; Garment waste; Lump charcoal; Partnership for Clean Indoor Air; PCIA; PM<sub>2.5</sub>; Total hydrocarbon; Water Boiling Test; Stoves; charcoal; cooking appliance; emission; fuel consumption; household energy; particulate matter; pollutant",,,,,,"Rehfuess, E., (2006) Fuel for life: household energy and health, , World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland; (2002) The World Health report 2002: reducing risks, promoting healthy life, , World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland; Mumford, J.L., Harris, D.B., Williams, K., Chuang, J.C., Cooke, M., Indoor air sampling and mutagenicity studies of emissions from unvented coal (1987) Environ Sci Technol, 21, pp. 308-311; Smith, K.R., Khalil, M.A.K., Rasmussen, R.A., Thorneloe, S.A., Manegdeg, F., Apte, M., Greenhouse gases from biomass and fossil fuel stoves in developing countries: a Manila pilot study (1993) Chemosphere, 26, pp. 479-505; Ballard-Tremeer, G., Jawurek, H.H., Comparison of five rural, wood-burning cooking devices: efficiencies and emissions (1996) Biomass Bioenergy, 11 (5), pp. 419-430; Gupta, S., Saksena, S., Shankar, V.R., Joshi, V., Emission factors and thermal efficiencies of cooking biofuels from five countries (1998) Biomass Bioenergy, 14, pp. 547-559; Oanh, N.T.K., Reutergårdh, L.B.R., Dung, N.T., Emission of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and particulate matter from domestic combustion of selected fuels (1999) Environ Sci Technol, 33 (16), pp. 2703-2709; Zhang, J., Smith, K.R., Emissions of carbonyl compounds from various cookstoves in China (1999) Environ Sci Technol, 33 (14), pp. 2311-2320; Zhang, J., Smith, K.R., Uma, R., Ma, Y., Kishore, V.V.N., Lata, K., Carbon monoxide from cookstoves in developing countries: 1.
