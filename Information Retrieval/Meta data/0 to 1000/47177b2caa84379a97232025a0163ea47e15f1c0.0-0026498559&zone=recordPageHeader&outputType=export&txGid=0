Six species are classified endangered or vulnerable at a global level. Maps indicating the known distribution of 18 taxa are presented. The percentage of Sphagnum taxa considered R, V or E seems lower than that for bryophytes in general. Sphagnum species should be protected because of their potential value as indicators of global warming and atmospheric pollution. © 1992.",,"endangered; moss; North America; Sphagnum",,,,,,"Anderson, A checklist of Sphagnum in North America north of Mexico (1990) Bryologist, 93, pp. 500-501; Andrus, Some aspects of Sphagnum ecology (1986) Canadian Journal of Botany, 64, pp. 416-426; Andrus, Why rare and endangered bryophytes?
