All manufacturing firms examined in this study are listed in Tokyo stock exchange market. We use DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) as an evaluation methodology. This study finds that large firms have managerial capabilities to improve their operational and environmental performance. The improvement leads to the enhancement of their financial performance. However, we cannot find such a business linkage in small and medium-sized firms. They improve their operational performance and then direct themselves toward the improvement of their environmental performance. Their environmental performance is, not the first priority, the second priority for the small and medium-sized firms even though Japanese government is currently making a policy pressure on all manufacturing firms to pay attention to various environmental issues related to the global warming and climate change. The environmental protection policy is effective on only large Japanese manufacturing firms that have technological and financial capabilities for environmental protection. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.
