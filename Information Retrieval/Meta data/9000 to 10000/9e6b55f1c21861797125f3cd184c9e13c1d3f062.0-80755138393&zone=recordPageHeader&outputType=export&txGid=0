Lyngby, Denmark","A finite element model of an unheated museum store has been developed for simulating the influence of the building envelope, the wall thickness and the thermal interaction with the surrounding ground on indoor temperature of the store. The question of whether to build the store with high thermal mass or with well-insulated walls with no thermal mass is addressed. The influence from excess humidity entering the store through cracks in the building envelope is also discussed. Finally, ways to stabilize the store temperature by improved design, such as additional insulation of the foundation, will be analysed. The simulations are compared with measurements in a museum store in Ribe, Denmark. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Energy; Finite element model; Museum stores; Thermal buffering","Additional insulation; Building envelopes; Denmark; Energy; Finite element models; High thermal; Indoor temperature; Temperate climate; Thermal buffering; Thermal condition; Thermal interaction; Thermal mass; Through cracks; Wall thickness; Climate models; Climatology; Finite element method; Solar buildings; Thermal insulation; Walls (structural partitions); Museums",,,,,,"Padfield, T., Larsen, P.K., Designing museums with a naturally stable climate (2004) Studies in Conservation, (49), pp. 131-137; Padfield, T., Larsen, P.K., Jensen, L.Aa., Ryhl-Svendsen, M., The potential and limits for passive air conditioning of museums, stores and archives (2007) Museum Microclimates: Conference on Preventive Conservation, National Museum of Denmark, 19-23 November 2007, pp. 191-198. , T.
