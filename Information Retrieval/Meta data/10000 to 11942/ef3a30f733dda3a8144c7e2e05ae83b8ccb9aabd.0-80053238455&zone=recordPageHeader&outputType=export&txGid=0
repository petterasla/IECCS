However, most of them focused on investigating impacts of MSW on GHG emission amounts. This study presents two mixed integer bilevel decision-making models for integrated municipal solid waste management and GHG emissions control: MGU-MCL and MCU-MGL. The MGU-MCL model represents a top-down decision process, with the environmental sectors at the national level dominating the upper-level objective and the waste management sectors at the municipal level providing the lower-level objective. The MCU-MGL model implies a bottom-up decision process where municipality plays a leading role. Results from the models indicate that: the top-down decisions would reduce metric tonne carbon emissions (MTCEs) by about 59% yet increase about 8% of the total management cost; the bottom-up decisions would reduce MTCE emissions by about 13% but increase the total management cost very slightly; on-site monitoring and downscaled laboratory experiments are still required for reducing uncertainty in GHG emission rate from the landfill facility. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Bilevel decision-making; Emissions control; Greenhouse gases; Waste management","Bilevel decision-making; Carbon emissions; Decision process; Emissions control; Environmental sector; GHG emission; Laboratory experiments; Management costs; Mixed integer; National level; On-site monitoring; Topdown; Cost reduction; Decision making; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Waste management; Municipal solid waste; carbon; decision making; emission control; greenhouse gas; laboratory method; landfill; municipal solid waste; uncertainty analysis; waste management; air pollution control; article; bottom up decision making; carbon footprint; cost; decision making; government; laboratory test; landfill; municipal solid waste; pollution monitoring; solid waste management; top down decision making; Decision Making, Organizational; Greenhouse Effect; Models, Theoretical; Refuse Disposal; Saskatchewan",,"carbon, 7440-44-0",,,,"Dennison, R., Environmental lifecycle comparisons of recycling, landfilling, and incineration: a review of recent studies (1996) Annu.
