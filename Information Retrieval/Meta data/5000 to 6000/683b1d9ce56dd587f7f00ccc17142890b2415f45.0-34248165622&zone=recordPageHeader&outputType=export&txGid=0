We studied relationships between various phenophases (i.e., seasonal biological events) and interannual variations of air temperature in three woody plant species (Prunus davidiana, Hibiscus syriacus, and Cercis chinensis) in the Beijing Metropolis, China, based on phenological data for the period 1962-2004 and meteorological data for the period 1951-2004. Analysis of phenology and climate data indicated significant changes in spring and autumn phenophases and temperatures. Changes in phenophases were observed for all the three species, consistent with patterns of rising air temperatures in the Beijing Metropolis. The changing phenology in the three plant species was reflected mainly as advances of the spring phenophases and delays in the autumn phenophases, but with strong variations among species and phenophases in response to different temperature indices. Most phenophases (both spring and autumn phenophases) had significant relationships with temperatures of the preceding months. There existed large inter- and intra-specific variations, however, in the responses of phenology to climate change. It is clear that the urban heat island effect from 1978 onwards is a dominant cause of the observed phenological changes. Differences in phenological responses to climate change may cause uncertain ecological consequences, with implications for ecosystem stability and function in urban environments. © 2006 The Ecological Society of Japan.","Beijing Metropolis; Climate change; Phenology; Temperature indices; Urbanization","air temperature; annual variation; climate change; ecological stability; ecosystem function; global climate; heat island; metropolitan area; ontogeny; phenology; seasonal variation; temperature effect; urban area; urbanization; woody plant; Asia; Beijing [China]; China; Eurasia; Far East; Cercis chinensis; Hibiscus; Hibiscus syriacus; Prunus; Prunus davidiana",,,,,,"Ahas, R., Aasa, A., Menzel, A., Fedotova, V.G., Scheifinger, H., Changes in European spring phenology (2002) Int J Climatol, 22, pp. 1727-1738; Arnfield, A.J., Two decades of urban climate research: A review of turbulence exchanges of energy and water, and the urban heat island (2003) Int J Climatol, 23, pp. 1-26; Bradley, N.L., Leopold, A.C., Ross, J., Huffaker, W., Phenological changes reflect climate change in Wisconsin (1999) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 96, pp. 9701-9704; Camilloni, I., Barros, V., On the urban heat island effects dependence on temperature trends (1997) Clim Change, 3, pp. 665-681; Chmielewski, F.M., Müller, A., Bruns, E., Climate changes and trends in phenology of fruit trees and field crops in Germany, 1961-2000 (2004) Agric For Meteorol, 121, pp. 69-78; Cleugh, H.A., Grimmond, C.S.B., Modelling regional scales surface energy exchanges and CBL growth in a heterogeneous, urban-rural landscape (2001) Bound Lay Meteorol, 98, pp. 1-31; Corlett, R.T., Lafrankie Jr, J.V., Potential impacts of climate change on tropical asian forests through an influence on phenology (1998) Clim Change, 39, pp. 439-453; Dixon, A.F.G., Climate change and phenological asynchrony (2003) Ecol Entomol, 28, pp. 380-381; Dunne, J.A., Harte, J., Taylor, K.J., Subalpine meadow flowering phenology responses to climate change: Integrating experimental and gradient methods (2003) Ecol Monogr, 73, pp. 69-86; Edwards, M., Richardson, A.J., Impact of climate change on marine pelagic pheology and trophic mismatch (2004) Nature, 430, pp. 881-884; Figuerola, P.I., Mazzeo, N., Urban-rural temperature differences in Buenos Aires (1998) Int J Climatol, 18, pp. 1709-1723; Fitter, A.H., Fitter, R.S.R., Rapid changes in flowering time in British plants (2002) Science, 296, pp. 1689-1691; Gallo, K.P., McNab, A.L., Karl, T.R., Brown, J.F., Hood, J.J., Tarpley, J.D., The use of NOAA AVHRR data for assessment of the urban heat island effect (1993) J Appl Meteorol, 5, pp. 899-908; Hansen, J., Lebedeff, S., Global trends of measured surface air temperature (1987) J Geophys Res, 92, pp. 13345-13372; Hansen, J., Ruedy, R., Sato, M., Reynolds, R., Global surface air temperature in 1995: Return to pre-pinatubo level (1996) Geophys Res Lett, 23, pp. 1665-1668; Henry, G.H.R., Molau, U., Tundra plants and climate change: The international tundra experiment (ITEX) (1997) Glob Change Biol, 3, pp. 1-9; Hinkel, K.M., Nelson, F.E., Klene, A.E., Bell, J.H., The urban heat island in winter at Barrow, Alaska (2003) Int J Climatol, 23, pp. 1889-1905; Hung, T., Uchihama, D., Ochi, S., Yasuoka, Y., Assessment with satellite data of the urban heat island effects in Asian mega cities (2006) Int J Appl Earth Obser Geoinf, 8, pp. 34-48; (1965) Plant and animal phenology observation annals in China, (1-11). , Institute of Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Geology Press, Beijing; (2001) Climate change 2001: Synthesis report, , Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Kim, Y.-H., Baik, J.-J., Maximum urban heat island intensity in Seoul (2002) J Appl Meteor, 41, pp. 651-659; Kudo, G., Nishikawa, Y., Kasagi, T., Kosuge, S., Does seed production of spring ephemerals decrease when spring comes early?
