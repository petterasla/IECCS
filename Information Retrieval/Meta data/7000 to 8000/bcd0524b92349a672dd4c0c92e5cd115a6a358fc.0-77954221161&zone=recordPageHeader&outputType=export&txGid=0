The World Bank and other international funding agencies recognized the already existing water crisis in many places around the world. As an outcome to an integrated water resources management there will be a need for proper supply and demand management. However, the enhancement of the existing water resources via wastewater reuse and brackish and seawater desalination is eminent. It will be even applied at a larger scale when the adverse effect of the climate change on water resources will be considered. The World Bank is allocating billions of dollars to mitigate for the climate change and reduce the global warming effects via the improvement in the energy efficiency, energy conservation and enhancement of renewable energy resources. Some mechanisms where established that the water resources enhancement can benefit from. These include the Clean Development Mechanism and the Joint Implementation in relation to the Carbon Financing. The paper will touch base on the wide perspective of the Bank's initiatives and mechanisms aiming at securing water supply under expected increasing scarcity. © 2009 Desalination Publications.","Carbon finance; Climate change; Demand; Desalination; Efficiency; Kyoto Protocol; Reverse osmosis; Supply; Water scarcity",,,,,,,"World Bank, Annual Report, 2007(1998) AquaStat, , FAO; Belloumi, M., Desalination as an option to resolve problems of water scarcity in MENA Region (2007) Second French Serbian Summer School Vrnjačka Banja; Doumani, F.M., (2008) Climate Change Adaptation In the Water Sector In the Middle East & North Africa Region: A Review of Main Issues, , PAP/RAC Workshop, Sardinia; Hamilton, B.A., Public private partnership in the MENA water sector (2006) Challenges and Opportunities, OECD Conference On Public Private Partnership For Infrastructure Financing, , Istanbul, Turkey; Remawi, E., Entrepreneurship as public policy: Completing the ecosystem with technology venture capital (2006) HCT-MIT Entrepreneurship Conference, , Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Balaban, M., Desalination in Maghreb (2007) Euromed Conference On Desalination Strategies In South Mediterranean Countries, , Tunisia; Global Warming Intelligence, Desalination Markets 2005-2015: A Global Assessment and Forecast, 1st ed., 2004World Bank, Carbon finance for sustainable development, 2007World Bank Institute, State and trends of the carbon market, 2008","Al-jamal, K.; MNSSD, The World BankPalestine; email: kaljamal@worldbank.org",,,"Taylor and Francis Inc.",,,,,19443994,,,,"English","Desalin.
