In order to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, most countries are implementing regulations aimed at reducing their dependence on fossil fuels, promoting energy efficiency practices and favoring the deployment of low carbon energy technologies, including renewable energy sources. In line with the international commitments assumed as a member of the European Union (EU) and also as a signatory of the Kyoto Protocol, Spain developed a National Plan for Renewable Energies (PER 2005-2010) that forms the basis of the national strategy in this field. Spain has often been cited as an example for the rapid growth in the use of low carbon energy technologies. However, despite significant progress in the last decade, Spain is far from meeting the national objectives set in PER primarily due to slow growth in the demand for biofuels and the limited success of biomass fired power plants. The evolution in other energy technologies has been faster, situating Spain as world a leader in solar and wind energy. However, the contribution of these technologies to the national consumption is very marginal. In the midst of intense regulatory, commercial and R&D activity, this paper analyses the current situation with respect to the production of renewable energies in Spain, focusing primarily on the use of biomass resources. The paper offers a general view of policy and regulatory background, illustrates current progress towards meeting national objectives and provides a brief description of representative projects and market activity in biofuel production and biomass valorization. © 2010 Global NEST.","Biomass; Energy policy; Renewable energies; Spain",,,,,,,"(1997) Renewable energy: White Paper laying down a Community strategy and action plan COM(97) 599, , http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l27023.htm, EU; (2004) Case Study: Biomass central heating in Cuéllar-Segovia (Spain), , http://www.managenergy.net/products/R913.htm, EU, Directorate-General for Energy and Transport; (2005) Biomass Action Plan.
