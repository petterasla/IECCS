Using building computer simulations, the impact of warmer weather is evaluated on the design and performance of air-conditioned office buildings in Australia, including the increased cooling loads and probable indoor temperature increases due to a possibly undersized air-conditioning system, as well as the possible change in energy use. It is found that existing office buildings would generally be able to adapt to the increasing warmth of year 2030 Low and High scenarios projections and the year 2070 Low scenario projection. However, for the 2070 High scenario, the study indicates that the existing office buildings in all capital cities of Australia would suffer from overheating problems. For existing buildings designed for current climate conditions, it is shown that there is a nearly linear correlation between the increase of average external air temperature and the increase of building cooling load. For the new buildings designed for warmer scenarios, a 28-59% increase of cooling capacity under the 2070 High scenario would be required.","Air-conditioning; Australia; Building simulation; Climate change; Cooling loads; Energy use; Global warming; Overheating hours","Atmospheric temperature; Climatology; Cooling; Global warming; Office buildings; Australia; Building simulation; Cooling loads; Energy use; Overheating hours; Air conditioning",,,,,,"Aguiar, R., Oliveira, M., Gonçalves, H., Climate change impacts on the thermal performance of Portuguese buildings.
