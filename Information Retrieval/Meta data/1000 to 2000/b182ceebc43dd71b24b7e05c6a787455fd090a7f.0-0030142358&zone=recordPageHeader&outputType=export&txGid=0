These can be summarized as follows: (i) to prevent pollution and contamination in manufacturing activities by way of environmental management and investment for improvements Hitachi has invested for the last twenty years; (ii) to establish an action program for environmental issues such as ozone-layer protection, global-warming prevention, industrial-waste reduction and products recycling; and (iii) to innovate and develop product technologies for the improvement of energy efficiency, contributing to the prevention of global warming.",,"Electric industry; Electronics industry; Energy efficiency; Global warming; Industrial wastes; Ozone layer; Pollution control; Recycling; Environment; Environmental management; Environmental protection",,,,,,,"Ochiai, Izumi; Hitachi Ltd, Tokyo, Japan",,,"Elsevier Science Inc, New York, NY, United States","Proceedings of the 1993 International Symposium on Metal-forming Related Environmental Issues","1 May 1993 through 1 May 1993","Tsukuba, Jpn",45309,09240136,,JMPTE,,"English","J Mater Process Technol",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030142358
