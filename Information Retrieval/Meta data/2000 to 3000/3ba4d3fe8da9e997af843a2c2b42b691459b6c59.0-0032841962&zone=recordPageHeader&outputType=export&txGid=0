A model relating historical crop hail losses to climatic variables was developed for each area. These models included seasonal measures of vertical instability, low-level moisture and the height of the freezing level. In both areas, windshear was not found to be an important factor influencing seasonal crop hail losses. The two crop hail loss models were then used in conjunction with upper-air climatic data from three single mixed-layer global climate models (GCMs). Each GCM was run for 1 x CO2 conditions and for 2 x CO2 conditions. The enhanced greenhouse effect on climatic variables was taken to be the difference between their values for these two runs. Changes to climatic variables were then translated directly into changes in the percentage value of the winter cereal crop lost due to hail. In both areas, the three GCMs agreed concerning the direction of change in each of the variables used in the crop hail loss model. GCM simulations of the greenhouse effect resulted in a decline in winter cereal crop hail losses, with the exception of one GCM simulation at one location where losses increased slightly. None of the changes due to the enhanced greenhouse effect, however, were significant owing to a large observed seasonal variability of crop hail losses. Also, the simulated seasonal variability of crop hail losses did not change significantly due to the enhanced greenhouse effect. These results depended on two important assumptions. Firstly, it was assumed that the dominant relationships between climatic variables and crop hail losses in the past would remain the same in a future climate. Secondly, it was assumed that the single mixed-layer GCMs used in the study were correctly predicting climate change under enhanced greenhouse conditions.",,"climate change; crop damage; general circulation model; global warming; hail; Australia",,,,,,"Allan, R., Historical Climatology of Pressure Anomalies, ENSO and Australian Rainfall (1994) Agric.
