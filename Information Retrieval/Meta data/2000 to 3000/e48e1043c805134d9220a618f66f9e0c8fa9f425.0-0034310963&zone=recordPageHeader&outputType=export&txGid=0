Base on the calculations the relations between the surface concentration of liquid carbon dioxide droplet with the hydrate film and the solubility and those between the ambient carbon dioxide concentration in the plume and the dissolution rate were obtained. The results show that a carbon dioxide droplet is released both at 1000 m in depth with the initial droplet diameter of 0.011 m or less and at 1500 m in depth with a diameter of 0.015 m or less, and the droplet is completely dissolved below 500 m in depth. The hydrate film acts as a resistant layer for the dissolution of liquid carbon dioxide, and the effect of the hydrate film on the dissolution of liquid carbon dioxide depended upon the depth.","Carbon dioxide; Dissolution; Global warming; Hydrate film; Sequestration",,,,,,,"Aya, I., Yamane, K., Yamada, N., Stability of clathrate-hydrate of carbon dioxide in highly pressurized water (1992) ASME HTD, 215, pp. 17-22; Choi, S.M., Convention on climate change (1992) Journal of KSME, 32 (12), pp. 1066-1075; Clift, R., Grace, J.R., Weber, M.E., (1978) Bubbles, Drops and Particles, pp. 97-135. , Academic Press; Hirai, S., Okazaki, K., Araki, Yazavva, H., Ito, H., Hijikata, K., Transport phenomena of liquid carbon dioxide in pressurized water flow with clathrate-hydrate at the interface (1996) Energy Convers.
