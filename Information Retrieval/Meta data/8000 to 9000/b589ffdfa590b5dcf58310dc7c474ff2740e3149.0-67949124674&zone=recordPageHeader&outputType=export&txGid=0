The use of vegetal fibers as major source of renewable resources represents a valuable alternative both from economical and environmental points of view. Traditionally, vegetal fibers are widely used in textile industry, paper manufacture, and packaging. Due to their specific properties, vegetal fibers are gained increased attention in obtaining composite materials. This paper reviews the sources of vegetal fibers that can be potentially used as reinforcements in composite materials. The structure and properties of wood and annual plant fibers are briefly discussed. The advantages of vegetal fibers as raw materials in composite applications are also presented. Some considerations regarding environmental impact of using vegetal fibers in composites are underlined.","Composites; Environment; Nonwoods; Renewable resources; Vegetal fibers",,,,,,,"Bierman, C.J., (1996) Handbook of Pulping and Papermaking, , Second Edition, Academic Press, San Diego, USA; Blechschmidt, J., Heinemann, S., Süss, H.-U., II Mechanical Pulping (2006) Handbook of Pulp, pp. 1069-1078. , Edited by Sixta H, Ed, WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
