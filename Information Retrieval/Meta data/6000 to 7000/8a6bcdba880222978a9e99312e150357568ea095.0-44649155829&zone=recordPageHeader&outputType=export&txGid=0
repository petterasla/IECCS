A technology fund could implement a reverse auction by taking bids from firms in developing countries for how much they would have to be paid to install climate-friendly technology, such as carbon capture and storage equipment at a coal-fired power plant. The fund would rank the bids, pay out funds starting with the lowest-cost bid, and work through the bids until all monies had been disbursedBarrett, note 20 abovePershing, note 42 aboveWiener, J.B., Incentives and Meta-Architecture note 13 above, pp. 67-80. , Aldy and Stavins, eds; Stewart, R.B., Wiener, J.B., (2003) Reconstructing Climate Policy, , Washington, DC: AEI Press; note 5 above, p. 3. , UNFCCC, Article; Michaelowa, note 15 above;Gupta, J., Beyond Graduation and Deepening: Towards Cosmopolitan Scholarship note 13 above, pp. 116-130. , Aldy and Stavins, eds; Nordhaus, note 38 above; Frankel, note 13 aboveAldy, J.E., Baron, R., Tubiana, L., Addressing Cost: The Political Economy of Climate Change (2003) Beyond Kyoto: Advancing the International Effort Against Climate Change, pp. 85-110. , J.
