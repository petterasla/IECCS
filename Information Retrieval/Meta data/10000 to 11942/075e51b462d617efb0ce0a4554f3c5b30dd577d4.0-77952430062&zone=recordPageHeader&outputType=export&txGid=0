Although the duration of snow cover is generally expected to decrease in the future as a result of global warming, the amounts of snow might increase in arctic areas where much of the elevated precipitation will fall as snow. We examined the effects of an increased snow cover, as a result of a snow fence treatment, on soil nitrogen mineralization, plant phenology, plant chemistry (nitrogen and potential defense compounds), the level of invertebrate herbivory, and performance of invertebrate herbivores in an arctic ecosystem, using dwarf birch (Betula nana) and the autumnal moth (Epirrita autumnata) as study organisms. An enhanced and prolonged snow cover increased the level of herbivory on dwarf birch leaves. Larvae feeding on plants that had experienced enhanced snow cover grew faster and pupated earlier than larvae fed with plant material from control plots, indicating that plants from enhanced snow-lie plots produce higher-quality food to herbivores. The increased larval growth rate was strongly correlated with higher leaf nitrogen concentration in plants subjected to snow manipulation, and also to certain phenolic acids. Snow manipulation did not change net nitrogen mineralization rates in the soil or total carbon concentration in leaves, but it altered the within-season fluctuating pattern of leaf phenolic compounds. This study demonstrates a positive relationship between increased snow cover and level of herbivory on deciduous shrubs, thus proposing a negative feedback on the climate-induced dwarf shrub expansion in arctic areas. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Betula nana; Climate change; Epirrita autumnata; Nitrogen; Plant phenology; Snow fence","arctic environment; deciduous tree; growth rate; herbivory; larva; moth; phenolic compound; phenology; phytochemistry; shrub; snow cover; soil nitrogen; Betula nana; Epirrita autumnata; Invertebrata; Lepidoptera",,,,,,"Aerts, R., Cornelissen, J.H.C., Dorrepaal, E., Plant performance in a warmer world: General responses of plants from cold, northern biomes and the importance of winter and spring events (2006) Plant Ecol, 182, pp. 65-77; Aerts, R., Callaghan, T.V., Dorrepaal, E., van Logtestijn, R.S.P., Cornelissen, J.H.C., Seasonal climate manipulations result in species specific changes in leaf nutrient levels and isotopic composition in a subarctic bog (2009) Funct Ecol, 23, pp. 680-688; Awmack, C.S., Leather, S.R., Host plant quality and fecundity in herbivorous insects (2002) Annu Rev Entomol, 47, pp. 817-844; Ayres, M.P., Maclean, S.F., Development of birch leaves and the growth energetics of Epirrita autumnata (Geometridae) (1987) Ecology, 68, pp. 558-568; Bale, J.S., Masters, G.J., Hodkinson, I.D., Awmack, C., Bezemer, T.M., Brown, V.K., Butterfield, J., Whittaker, J.B., Herbivory in global climate change research: Direct effects of rising temperature on insect herbivores (2002) Glob Chang Biol, 8, pp. 1-16; Binkley, D., Hart, S.C., The components of nitrogen availability assessments in forest soils (1989) Adv Soil Sci, 10, pp. 57-112; Bowman, W.D., Input and storage of nitrogen in winter snow pack in an alpine ecosystem (1992) Arct Alp Res, 24, pp. 211-215; Callaghan, T.V., Björn, L.O., Chernov, Y., Chapin, T., Christensen, T.R., Huntley, B., Ims, R.A., Zöckler, C., Climate change and UV-B impacts on Arctic tundra and polar desert ecosystems-responses to projected changes in climate and UV-B at the species level (2004) Ambio, 33, pp. 418-435; Cook, J.G., (2005) Plant ecophysiological responses to experimentally drier and warmer conditions in European shrub lands, p. 207. , Unpublished PhD thesis.
