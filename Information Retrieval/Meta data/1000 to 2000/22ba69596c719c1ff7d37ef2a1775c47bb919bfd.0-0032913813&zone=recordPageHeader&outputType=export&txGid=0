This decrease would substantially increase the atmospheric CO2 concentration because soil contains twice as much C as the present atmosphere and the decomposed C from soil will be released to the atmosphere. These predictions of the decrease in soil C storage are, however, largely dependent on the implied assumption that the decomposition of all soil organic matter is as sensitive to temperature as is the decomposition of young litter. We used measurements of the amount and age of soil C and the decomposition of litter on temperature gradients and a simple model describing soil C dynamics to show that the decomposition of old soil organic matter is resistant to changes in temperature. Accordingly, in response to climatic warming, we estimate decomposition to accelerate significantly less than previously expected, and predict that the C storage of boreal forest soils will increase.",,"carbon emission; decomposition; global warming; organic matter; soil carbon",,,,,,"Post, W.M., Emanuel, W.R., Zinke, P.J., Stangenberger, A.C., Soil carbon pools and world life zones (1982) Nature, 298, pp. 156-159; Watson, R.T., Rodhe, H., Oeschger, H., Siegenthaler, U., Greenhouse gases and aerosols (1990) Climate Change, the IPCC Scientific Assessment, pp. 1-40. , Houghton, J.T., Jenkins, G.J. and Ephraums, J.J.

Firstly, in our model woody litter was also put to the first compartment and for such litter with a higher concentration of slowly decomposing compounds this percentage was expected to be higher. Second, this particular percentage led to a residence time of 5 years for the first model compartment at the annual mean temperature of 4.0°C and thus enabled using the earlier determined decomposition rates as the reference rates at this temperature (7); Berg, B., Berg, M.P., Bottner, P., Box, E., Breymeyer, A., De Calvo Anta, R., Couteaux, M., De Virzo Santo, A., Litter mass loss rates in pine forests of Europe and Eastern United States: Some relationships with climate and litter quality (1993) Biogeochemistry, 20, pp. 127-159; Mikola, P., Comparative experiment on decomposition rates of forest litter in southern and northern Finland (1960) Oikos, 11, pp. 161-166; Koivisto, P., Regionality of forest growth in Finland (1970) Commun.
