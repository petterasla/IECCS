Four scenarios mostly used in China were compared to assess the influence of various technologies on environment: (1) landfill, (2) incineration, (3) composting plus landfill, and (4) composting plus incineration. In all scenarios, the technologies significantly contribute to global warming and increase the adverse impact of non-carcinogens on the environment. The technologies played only a small role in the impact of carcinogens, respiratory inorganics, terrestrial ecotoxicity, and non-renewable energy. Similarly, the influence of the technologies on the way other elements affect the environment was ignorable. Specifically, the direct emissions from the operation processes involved played an important role in most scenarios except for incineration, while potential impact generated from transport, infrastructure and energy consumption were quite small. In addition, in the global warming category, highest potential impact was observed in landfill because of the direct methane gas emissions. Electricity recovery from methane gas was the key factor for reducing the potential impact of global warming. Therefore, increasing the use of methane gas to recover electricity is highly recommended to reduce the adverse impact of landfills on the environment. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Direct emissions; Ecotoxicity; Electricity recovery; Energy consumption; Inorganics; Key factors; Life-cycle assessments; Methane gas; Municipal Solid Waste; Municipal solid waste management; Non-renewable energy; Operation process; Potential impacts; Carcinogens; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Global warming; Land fill; Life cycle; Methane; Renewable energy resources; Solid wastes; Technology; Waste disposal; Waste incineration; Waste treatment; Environmental impact assessments; carcinogen; inorganic compound; methane; carcinogen; composting; environmental impact assessment; global warming; incineration; landfill; life cycle analysis; methane; municipal solid waste; toxicity; waste management; article; China; composting; ecotoxicity; electricity; energy recovery; exhaust gas; greenhouse effect; incineration; landfill; life cycle assessment; municipal solid waste; priority journal; solid waste management; technology; Algorithms; Carbon; Carcinogens; China; Cities; Electricity; Environment; Environmental Monitoring; Gases; Global Warming; Methane; Program Evaluation; Refuse Disposal; Waste Management; China",,"methane, 74-82-8; Carbon, 7440-44-0; Carcinogens; Gases; Methane, 74-82-8",,,,"Abanades, S., Flamant, G., Gagnepain, B., Gauthier, D., Fate of heavy metals during municipal solid waste incineration (2002) Waste Management Research, 20, pp. 55-68; Arena, U., Mastellone, M.L., Perugini, F., The environmental performance of alternative solid waste management options: a life cycle assessment study (2003) Chemical Engineering Journal, 96, pp. 207-222; Banar, M., Cokaygil, Z., Ozkan, A., Life cycle assessment of solid waste management options for Eskisehir, Turkey (2009) Waste Management, 29, pp. 54-62; Bjarnadóttir, H.J., Friöriksson, G., Johnsen, T., Sletsen, H., (2002), Guidelines for the Use of LCA in the Waste Management Sector.
