However, there is experimental data to suggest that temperature increases the pool size of substrate C available for microbial respiration with little effect on first-order rate constants. We reasoned that changes in soil temperature alter the composition of microbial communities, wherein dominant populations at higher temperatures have the ability to metabolize substrates that are not used by members of the microbial community at lower temperatures. To gain insight into changes in microbial community composition and function following soil warming, we used molecular techniques of phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) and lipopolysaccharide fatty acid (LPS-OHFA) analysis and compared the kinetics of microbial respiration for soils incubated from 5 to 25°C. Substrate pools for microbial respiration and the abundance of PLFA and LPS-OHFA biomarkers for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria differed significantly among temperature treatments, providing evidence for a shift in the function and composition of microbial communities related to soil warming. We suggest that shifts in microbial community composition following either large seasonal variation in soil temperature or smaller annual increases associated with global climate change have the potential to alter patterns of soil organic matter decomposition by a mechanism that is not considered by current simulation models.",,"Carbon; Climate change; Decay (organic); Ecosystems; Fatty acids; Mathematical models; Polysaccharides; Reaction kinetics; Soils; Substrates; Thermal effects; Lipopolysaccharide fatty acids; Microbial respiration; Phospholipid fatty acids; Soil warming; Microorganisms; biomarker; carbon dioxide; climate change; climatic change; decomposition; microbial community; microbial respiration; soil microorganism; soil warming",,,,,,"Behera, B., Wagner, G.H., Microbial growth rates in glucose amended soils (1974) Soil Sci.
