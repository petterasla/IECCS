Dist., Beijing 100093, China","Equilibrium carbon stock is the result of a balance between inputs and outflows to the pool. Changes in land-use are likely to alter such balance, resulting in different carbon stores under different land-use types in addition to the impacts of global climate change. In an agro-pastoral ecotone of Inner Mongolia, northern China, we investigated productivity and belowground carbon and nitrogen stores under six different types of land-uses, namely free grazing (FG), grazing exclusion (GE), mowing (MW), corn plantation (CP), fallow (FL), and alfalfa pasture (AP), and their impacts on litter and fine roots in semiarid grassland ecosystems. We found that there were great variations in aboveground net primary production (ANPP) across the six land-use types, with CP having markedly high ANPP; the FG had significantly reduced soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen stores (SON) to 100 cm depth compared with all other types of land uses, while very little litter accumulation was found on sites of the FG and CP. The top 20 cm of soils accounted for about 80% of the root carbon and nitrogen, with very little roots being found below 50 cm. About 60% of SOC and SON were stored in the top 30 cm layer. Land-use change altered the inputs of organic matters, thus affecting SOC and SON stores accordingly; the MW and GE sites had 59 and 56% more SOC and 61% more SON than the FG. Our estimation suggested that restoring severely degraded and overgrazed grasslands could potentially increase SOC and SON stores by more than 55%; conversion from the native grasses to alfalfa could potentially double the aboveground biomass production, and further increase SOC and SON stores by more than 20%. Our study demonstrated significant carbon and nitrogen storage potential of the agro-pastoral ecotone of northern China through land-use changes and improved management in the context of mitigating global climate change. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Agro-pastoral ecotone; Grassland; Land-use; Productivity; SOC; SON","carbon sequestration; ecotone; global climate; grassland; land type; land use change; net primary production; semiarid region; soil carbon; soil nitrogen; soil organic matter; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Nei Monggol; Medicago sativa; Poaceae; Zea mays",,,,,,"Bai, Y.F., Influence of seasonal distribution of precipitation on primary productivity of Stipa krylovii community (1999) Acta Phytoecol Sin, 23, pp. 155-160; Bao, Y.J., Li, Z.H., Zhong, Y.K., Compositional dynamics of plant functional groups and their effects on stability of community ANPPduring 17 yr of mowing succession on Leymus chinensis steppe of Inner Mongolia, China (2004) Acta Bot Sin, 46, pp. 1155-1162; Baoyin, T., Liu, D., The changing of ploughland and analysis of problem of Duo Lun County on agriculture-animal husbandry ecotone (2001) Acta Sci Nat Uni NeiMongol, 32, pp. 657-660; Bernacchi, C.J., Hollinger, S.E., Meyers, T., The conversion of the corn/soybean ecosystem to no-till agriculture may result in a carbon sink (2005) Global Change Biol, 11, pp. 1867-1872; Brown, S., Lugo, A.E., Effects of forest clearing and succession on the carbon and nitrogen content of soils in Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands (1990) Plant Soil, 124, pp. 53-64; Brye, K.R., Gower, S.T., Norman, J.M., Carbon budgets for a prairie and agroecosystems: Effects of land use and interannual variability (2002) Ecol Appl, 12, pp. 962-979; Burke, I.C., Laurenroth, W.K., Milchunas, D.G., Biogeochemistry of managed grasslands in central North America (1997) Soil organic matter in temperature agroecosystems: Long-term experiments in North America, pp. 85-102. , Paul EA, Elliott ET, Paustian K, Cole CV eds, CRC Press, Boca Rato, FL, pp; Cambardella, C.A., Elliott, E.T., Particulate soil organicmatter changes across a grassland cultivation sequence (1992) Soil Sci Soc Am J, 56, pp. 777-783; Canadell, J.G., Land use effects on terrestrial carbon sources and sinks (2002) Sci China Ser C, 45 (SUPPL.EMENT), pp. 1-9; Chuluun, T., Ojima, D., Land use change and carbon cycle in arid and semi-arid lands of East and Central Asia (2002) Sci China Ser C, 45 (SUPPL.EMENT), pp. 48-54; Conant, R.T., Paustian, K., Elliott, E.T., Grassland management and conversion into grassland: Effects on soil carbon (2001) Ecol Appl, 11, pp. 343-355; Cramer, W., Kicklighter, D.W., Bondeau, A., Comparing global models of terrestrial net primary productivity (NPP): Overview and key results (1999) Global Change Biol, 5, pp. 1-15; Davidson, E.A., Nepstad, D.C., Klink, C., Pasture soils as carbon sink (1995) Nature, 376, pp. 472-473; Degryze, S., Six, J., Paustian, K., Soil organic carbon pool changes following land-use conversions (2004) Global Change Biol, 10, pp. 1120-1132; Derner, J.D., Briske, D.D., Boutton, T.W., Does grazing mediate soil carbon and nitrogen accumulation beneath C4 perennial grasses along an environmental gradient?
