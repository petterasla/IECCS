The detailed inventory analysis was performed by allocating the Input/Output among the main products. The environmental impacts were assessed by using the following five Eco-indicators: Gross Energy Requirement (GER), Global Warming Potential (GWP), Acidification Potential (AP), Heavy Metal Toxicity (HMT) and Solid Waste Burden (SWB). This study is useful to address the environmental situation of the ISP practiced in this smelter, and provides a scientific basis for further improvement.","Impact assessment; Imperial smelting process; Lead; Life cycle assessment; Zinc","lead; zinc; article; China; environmental impact; greenhouse effect; priority journal; smelter; solid waste; toxicology",,,,,,,"Xueyi, G.; College of Metallurgical Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410083, China; email: xyguo@iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp",,,,,,,,09483349,,IJLCF,,"English","Int.
