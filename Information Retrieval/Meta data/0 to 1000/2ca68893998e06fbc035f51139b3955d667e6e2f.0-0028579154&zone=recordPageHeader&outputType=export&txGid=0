We first extend reservoir theory by quantifying the difference between turnover time and transit time (or residence time) for time-dependent systems under any mixing conditions. We explicitly demonstrate the errors which result from assuming these timescales are equal, which is only true at steady state. We also derive a new response function which allows the calculation of age distributions and timescales for well-mixed reservoirs away from steady state, and differentiate between timescales based on gross and net fluxes. -from Authors",,"anthropogenic carbon dioxide; greenhouse gas; reservoir theory; reservoir timescale; carbon; carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; article; astronomy; atmosphere; chemical model; chemistry; geology; greenhouse effect; human; Atmosphere; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Earth (Planet); Fossil Fuels; Geology; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Models, Chemical",,"Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9; Carbon, 7440-44-0; Fossil Fuels",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11541520,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028579154
