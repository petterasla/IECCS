This study examined soil C storage, an indicator of C sequestration potential, in homegardens (HGs), natural forest, and single-species stands of coconut (Cocos nucifera), rice (Oryza sativa)-paddy, and rubber (Hevea brasiliensis), in Thrissur district, Kerala, India. Soil samples collected from four depth zones up to 1 m were fractionated to three size classes (250 - 2000 μm, 53 - 250 μm, &lt; 53 μm) and their total C content determined. Total C stock (Mg ha-1) was highest in forests (176.6), followed by managed tree-based systems, and lowest in rice-paddy field (55.6). The results show storage of higher amounts of C in the &lt; 53 μm fraction, the most stable form of C in soil, up to one- meter depth, in land-use systems with high stand density of trees such as forests and small-sized HG. Although the results do not allow comparison of changes in soil C stock in different land-use systems, they show higher C storage in soils under tree-based land-use systems compared with the treeless (rice-paddy) system, especially in lower soil depths, suggesting the higher soil C sequestration potential of tree-based systems, and thereby their role in reducing atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2009.","Agroforestry; Carbon sequestration; Global warming; Homegarden; Soil aggregates","agroforestry; carbon sequestration; concentration (composition); dicotyledon; global warming; home garden; indicator mineral; land use; monocotyledon; paddy field; sample preparation; soil aggregate; soil depth; tropical environment; vegetation structure; India; Kerala; Thrissur; Cocos nucifera; Hevea brasiliensis; Oryza sativa",,,,,,"Albrecht, A., Kandji, S.T., Carbon sequestration in tropical agroforestry systems (2003) Agric Ecosyst Environ, 99, pp. 15-27; Andrade, H.J., Brook, R., Ibrahim, M., Growth, production and carbon sequestration of silvopastoral systems with native timber species in the dry lowlands of Costa Rica (2008) Plant Soil, 308, pp. 11-22; Bellamy, P.H., Loveland, P.J., Bradley, R.I., Lark, R.M., Kirk, G.J.D., Carbon losses from all soils across England (2005) Nature, 437, pp. 245-248; Brady, N.C., Weil, R.R., (2008) The Nature and Properties of Soil (13th Edition), , New York: Prentice Hall; Carter, M.R., Analysis of soil organic matter in agroecosystems (1996) Structure and Organic Matter Storage in Agricultural Soil, pp. 3-11. , M.
