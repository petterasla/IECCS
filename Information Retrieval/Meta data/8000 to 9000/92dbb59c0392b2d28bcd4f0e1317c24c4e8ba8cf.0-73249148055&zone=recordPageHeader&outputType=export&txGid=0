This greenhouse gas causes global warming after being emitted to the environment. To deal with this problem, a new dry scrubbing process was tested in this study. A three-stage countercurrent fluidized bed adsorber was developed, designed, and fabricated. It was used as a removal apparatus and operated in a continuous regime for the two-phase system. The height of each stage was 0.30 m, and the inner diameter was 0.10 m. The paper presents the removal of CO2 from gas mixtures by chemical sorption on porous granular calcium oxide particles in the reactor at ambient temperature. The advantages of a multistage fluidized bed reactor for high mass transfer and high gas-solid contact can enhance the removal of the gas when using a dry method. The effects of the operating parameters such as sorbent, superficial gas velocity, and the Weir height on CO2 removal efficiency in the multistage fluidized bed were investigated. The results indicate that the removal efficiency of the carbon dioxide was around 71% at a high solid flow rate corresponding to lower gas velocity at room temperature. In comparison with wet scrubbers, this dry process appears to have lower cost, less complicated configuration, and simpler disposal of used sorbent. The results in this study assume importance from the perspective of use of a multistage fluidized bed adsorber for control of gaseous pollutants at high temperature. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Adsorbers; Ambient temperatures; Calcium oxide particles; Chemical sorption; Combustion pro-cess; Counter current; Dry process; Dry scrubbing process; Gas velocity; Gas-solid; Gaseous pollutants; High temperature; High-solids; Inner diameters; Lower cost; Multi-stage fluidized bed; Multi-stage fluidized bed reactors; Operating parameters; Removal efficiencies; Room temperature; Superficial gas velocities; Thermal power plants; Two phase systems; Wet scrubbers; Calcium; Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Chemical reactors; Coal combustion; Coal fired boilers; Flue gases; Fluid catalytic cracking; Fluidized bed combustion; Fluidized bed furnaces; Fluidized beds; Fog; Gas adsorption; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; High temperature operations; Metal recovery; Particles (particulate matter); Removal; Scrubbers; Sorption; Thermoelectric power plants; Two phase flow; Fluidization",,,,,,"Yang, H., Xu, Z., Fan, M., Gupta, R., Slimane, R., Bland, A., Wright, I., Progress in carbon dioxide separation and capture: A review (2008) J.
