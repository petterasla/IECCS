International cooperation is critical to ensure the environmental and energy security of world economies on a global basis. For example, the USA has acquired a great deal of useful experience in clean coal technology, which has been demonstrated with major utilities in commercial operations. The adoption and installation of clean coal technology should be given high priority worldwide. The continuous exchange of information and technology between developed and developing economies relating to current and fut4f great importance. Developed economies that possess environmentally responsive technologies and financial resources should work closely with developing economies to facilitate technology transfer and trade of technologies. Cooperation between economies can result in lowering the cost of deploying clean coal technologies directed toward the clean production of energy. This paper discusses a bilateral approach, i.e. the US/China Center for Energy and Environment, to facilitate the mitigation of emissions and promote the clean use of coal to satisfy growing energy demand in developing economies.",,"Coal industry; Energy management; Environmental impact; Global warming; Industrial economics; International cooperation; Technology transfer; Clean coal technology; Environmental protection",,,,,,"Morita, K., Present trends and future outlook for supply and demand for thermal coal in Asia and the Pacific Rim region (1996) JAPAC News, (13). , June 1996; Yu, Z., Clean coal technologies: Key to solving the coal environmental problems (1995) Proceedings of the Second APEC Coal Flow Seminar, , Shanghai, 5-7 December 1995; (1996) Clean Coal Technology Demonstration Program, Program Update 1995, , US Department of Energy, April; (1996) China Environmental Technologies Export Market Plan, , Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee/Environmental Trade Working Group, US Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration, March; (1995) Technical Report: US/China Center for Energy and Environment Technology, , Beijing, China, November through March, Office of Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy, Department of Energy, USA","Hsieh, S.T.; Tulane Univ, New Orleans, United States",,,"Inderscience Enterprises Ltd, Geneve-15, Switzerland",,,,,09574352,,IJVLE,,"English","Int J Environ Pollut",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033281083
