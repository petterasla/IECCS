Predicted future impacts vary by region, but all are projected to suffer productivity declines by the late twenty-first century unless successful mitigation measures are implemented soon. Exacerbating the climate change challenge, doubling of overall crop productivity will be required by mid-century. Clearly, crop protection will become increasingly difficult as higher-yielding varieties present a larger and more tempting target to all pests, and the pests themselves extend their ranges poleward and into other new geographies owing to reduced winter kill and longer growing seasons. Fortunately, good progress on enhancing crop protection technology to meet these challenges is already being made, but the scope of this climatic provocation is such that complacency is not an option. Increased investment into new technologies and adoption of new agricultural practices with improved adaptive and mitigation potential are both essential. © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry.","Carbon footprint; Climate change mitigation; Drought; Global warming; Monsanto Fellows","carbon dioxide; adaptive management; advanced technology; agricultural practice; biological control; carbon; climate change; crop production; crop yield; drought; growing season; investment location; mitigation; precipitation intensity; technology adoption; twenty first century; agriculture; article; climate change; crop; environment; growth, development and aging; human; methodology; temperature; theoretical model; Agriculture; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Crops, Agricultural; Environment; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Temperature",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9",,,,"Hazell, B.R., (2002) Green revolution: curse or blessing?, p. 4. , International Food Policy Research Institute, Washington, DC; Dyson, T., World food trends: a neo-Malthusian prospect?
