Here an evaluation of the system is performed by employing coextensive temperature and precipitation data over the N. Hemisphere for the last 140 years. We found that the Koppen system is rather insensitive to the observed global warming and concluded that overall the system performs rather poorly over Europe and Asia whereas it appears adequate over N. America and N. Africa. -from Authors",,"climate classification system; global warming; Koppen system; regional climate; Classification (of information); Evaluation; Global warming; Monitoring; Precipitation (meteorology); Temperature; Climate classification system; Global climate pattern; Koppen system; Climatology",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00948276,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028669503
