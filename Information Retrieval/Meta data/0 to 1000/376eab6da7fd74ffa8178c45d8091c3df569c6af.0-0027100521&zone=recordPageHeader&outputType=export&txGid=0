The CO2emitted during cropping was compared with calculated methane production by ruminants grazing pasture at the site. Cultivation resulted in the loss of about 10 t soil organic carbon (C)/ha over 3 years but there was no change in soil C with no-tillage cropping. Grazing of pastures at a high but sustainable stocking rate was calculated to produce 205 kg C/ha per year as methane (CH4). No-tillage cropping of this site therefore contributes much less CH4and CO2to the atmosphere than either grazing or cropping with cultivation. Using 20-year global wanning potentials of 20 and 1 for CH4and CO2respectively, the data showed that ruminants grazing this site would have had more influence on atmospheric warming than cropping with cultivation did. © 1992 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.","Carbon dioxide; Cropping; Cultivation; Global warming; Methane; No-tillage; Pasture; Ruminants; Soil carbon","carbon dioxide; cultivation; greenhouse gas; Kairanga soil; methane emission; pasture; ruminant; soil; warming; New Zealand, North Island, Manawatu",,,,,,"The nutrient requirements of ruminant livestock (1980) Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux, Famham Royal, p. 31. , Slough, England; Blevens, R.L., Thomas, G.W., Cornelius, P.L., Influence of no-tillage and nitrogen fertilisation on certain soil properties after 5 years of continuous com (1977) Agronomy Journal, 69, pp. 383-386; Blevens, R.L., Thomas, G.W., Smith, M.S., Frye, W.W., Cornelius, P.L., Changes in soil properties after 10 years continuous non-tilled and conventionally tilled com (1983) Soil and Tillage Research, 3, pp. 135-146; Bowman, R.A., Reeder, J.D., Lober, R.W., Changes in soil properties in a central plains rangeland soil after 3, 20 and 60 years of cultivation (1990) Soil Science, 150, pp. 851-857; Brougham, R.W., Causley, D.C., Madgwick, L.E., Pasture management systems and animal production (1975) Proceedings of the Ruakura Farmers’ Conference, pp. 65-69; Cosgrove, G.P., Brougham, R.W., Pasture strategies for dairy beef production (1988) Proceedings of the New Zealand Grassland Association, 49, pp. 57-62; Cotching, W.E., Allbrook, R.F., Gibbs, H.S., Influence of maize cropping on the soil structure of two soils in the waikato district, New Zealand (1979) New Zealandjournal of Agricultural Research, 22, pp. 431-438; Geenty, K.G., Rattray, P.V., The energy requirements of grazing sheep and cattle (1987) New Zealand Society of Animal Production Occasional Publication No. 10, , Livestock feeding on pasture, Nicol, A.
