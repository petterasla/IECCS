There are now numerous such records for the Atlantic Ocean (USA) and Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, South Pacific Ocean, and a fewer number from the northwest Pacific and Indian Ocean regions. The most obvious characteristic of these records is that many reveal extended alternating periods of greater and lesser TC activity over the past 6000 years. The length of these phases of relative inactivity and greater activity depends on the chronological resolution of the record, with the coarser-resolution ones displaying multi-century to millennial-scale episodes and the high-resolution records displaying decadal to centennial-scale oscillations. In several instances the likely causes of these alternating periods of TC behaviour have been attributed to different phases of climate when El Niños and La Niñas dominated or to longer-term variations in sea surface temperatures and possibly solar forcing. The picture emerging from these records is that TC behaviour is not entirely stochastic over the long term and that any simulations of long-term TC behaviour need to account for these climatic influences. Incorporation of these observations, and the many more needed, is important for understanding the future behaviour of TCs. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Holocene; Palaeotempestology; Tropical cyclones","chronology; climate variation; computer simulation; El Nino; geological record; global climate; Holocene; La Nina; paleoclimate; paleotemperature; sea surface temperature; tropical cyclone; Atlantic Ocean; Caribbean Sea; Gulf of Mexico; Indian Ocean; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Northwest); Pacific Ocean (South)",,,,,,"Aharon, P., Lambert, W.J., Radiocarbon deficiencies of US Gulf Coast lakes compromise paleo-hurricane records (2009) Quaternary Research, 71, pp. 266-270; Besonen, M.R., Bradley, R.S., Mudelsee, M., A 1,000-year, annually-resolved record of hurricane activity from Boston, Massachusetts (2008) Geophysical Research Letters, 35, pp. L14705; Brettschneider, B., Climatological hurricane landfall probability for the United States (2008) Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology, 47, pp. 704-717; Buynevich, I.V., Donnelly, J.P., Geological signatures of barrier breaching and overwash, southern Massachusetts, USA (2004) Journal of Coastal Research, 39, pp. 112-116; Buynevich, I.V., FitzGerald, D.M., Goble, R.J., A 1500 yr record of North Atlantic storm activity based on optically dated relict beach scarps (2007) Geology, 35, pp. 543-546; Chan, J.C.L., Comment on 'changes in tropical cyclone number, duration, and intensity in a warming environment' (2006) Science, 311, p. 1713; Chenoweth, M., A reassessment of historical Atlantic basin tropical cyclone activity, 1700-1855 (2006) Climatic Change, 76, pp. 169-240; Collins, E.S., Scott, D.B., Gayes, P.T., Hurricane records on the South Carolina coast: can they be detected in the sediment record?
