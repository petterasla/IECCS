The framework consists of a number of integrated transdisciplinary modules. Environmental conditions and behavioral responses link to a physiological model, which predicts core temperature. Core temperature over time is then converted into a time-at-temperature metric. The output of the framework is a heat-related health effects index (HEI), reflecting the potential relative severity of the heat stress on health. The framework is flexible, allowing the individual models to be adapted to conditions at specific locations and to be updated as new information becomes available. Scenario analyses are easily accommodated, enabling the framework to evaluate issues such as intervention strategies and the possible effects of global climate change on heat-related illnesses. The framework and an initial set of component models were applied to conditions during the 1995 Chicago event and the results compared with published studies. For individuals, there was reasonably good agreement between HEI ratios and actual mortality risk ratios when comparing indoor versus outdoor environments. When aggregating across populations, predicted HEI ratios were significantly smaller than actual mortality ratios when comparing healthy versus compromised populations, supporting the notion that mortality may not be the best indicator of heat stress effects. Future work should include refinement of the initial models and application to other cities and heat events.","Chicago heat wave; Heat stress; Integrated modeling approach; Physiological model; Risk factors","climate change; health risk; heat flux",,,,,,"Bynum, G.D., Pandolf, K.B., Schuette, W.H., Goldman, R.F., Lees, D.E., Whang-Peng, J., Atkinson, E.R., Bull, J.M., Induced hyperthermia in sedated humans and the concept of critical thermal maximum (1978) Am J Physiol, 235, pp. R228-R236; Control and prevention heat-related mortality-Chicago, July 1995 (1995) Morb Mort Wkly Rep, 44, pp. 577-579. , Centers for Disease; Changnon, S.A., Kunkel, K.E., Reinke, B.C., Impacts and responses to the 1995 heat wave: A call to action (1996) Bull Am Meteorol Soc, 77, pp. 1497-1506; Drinkwater, B.L., Horvath, S.M., Heat tolerance and aging (1979) Med Sci Sports, 11, pp. 49-55; Givoni, B., Goldman, R.F., Predicting rectal temperature response to work, environment, and clothing (1972) J Appl Physiol, 32, pp. 812-822; Huang, J., (1996) DOE-2 Analysis of Indoor Temperatures in Typical Apartment Buildings during the July 1995 Chicago Summer Heat Wave, , Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, Berkeley, CA; Japsen, B., Moore J.D., Jr., Heat wave scorches emergency services (1995) Mod Healthcare, 25, p. 3; Kattenberg, A., Giorgi, F., Grassl, H., Meehl, G.A., Mitchell, J.F.B., Stouffer, R.J., Tokioka, T., Wigley, T.M.L., Climate models-projections of future climate (1996) Climate Change 1995: The Science of Climate Change, , Houghton JT, Meira Filho LG, Callander BA, Harris N, Kattenberg A, Maskell K (eds) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
