Results indicate that the average annual precipitation is 494.8 mm in La Niña years and only 408.8 mm in El Niño years. The difference is 86.0 mm, or 18.8% over the long-term average. The stream-flows in the La Niña years are higher than that in El Niño years: 9.2% at the Lan-Zhou station, 9.5% for Tou-Dao-Guai station, 11.8% for Long-Men, 17.6% for San-Men-Xia, 19.2% at the Hua-Yuan-Hou station, and 22.0% at the Li-Jin station. Both precipitation and stream-flow responses show temporal and spatial patterns. The relationship among the stream-flow, precipitation, and temperature, which was obtained by ArcGIS Geostatistical Analyst based on observed data, indicates stream-flow is sensitive to both precipitation and temperature. For small precipitation increases (less than 13%), the stream-flow percentage change is less than the precipitation change for the Yellow River. The results of this paper can be used as a reference for watershed water resources planning and management to maintain the healthy life and proper function of the river.
