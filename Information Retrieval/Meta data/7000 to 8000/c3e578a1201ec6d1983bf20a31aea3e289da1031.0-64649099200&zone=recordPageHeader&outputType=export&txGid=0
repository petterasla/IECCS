Thermal characterization of this new type of fuel is a premise before it is practically used in real facilities. Four sludge derived fuels were examined by thermal calorimeters (TG-DTA, C80, and TAM) at temperature ramp and isothermal conditions. Heat generation at low temperature was found in some sludge species. The corresponding spontaneous ignition was measured in an adiabatic spontaneous ignition tester at 80 ″C. The reason of the thermal behaviors of the sludge fuels was discussed. The critical temperature of large scale pile-up was predicted.","Biomass fuel; Self heating; Sewage sludge; Thermal activity",,,,,,,"Samela, D., Environmental Aspects of the Combustion of Sewage Sludge in a Utility Boiler (2006) Environmental Progress, 5 (2), pp. 110-115; Samela, D., (2004) Study on the Safety Measure Regarding Products and Inflammable Gas Sludge Oriign, , Japan Institute of Wastewater Engineering Technology; Rahman, M., Low Temperature Oxidation of Low Rank Coals (1986) Chem.
