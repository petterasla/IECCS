Despite the risk of heat-related morbidity and mortality, many cities lack written heat response plans. In a review of plans from 18 cities at risk for heat-related mortality, we found that many cities had inadequate or no heat response plans. This is an important area for further investigation and government attention.",,"emergency health service; health care access; health care planning; heat; human; mortality; review; risk management; United States; Heat Stroke; Humans; Infrared Rays; Local Government; Quality Assurance, Health Care; Regional Health Planning; Risk Factors; Seasons; Sunstroke; United States; Urban Health; Urban Population",,,,,,"McGeehin, M.A., Mirabelli, M., The potential impacts of climate variability and change on temperature-related morbidity and mortality in the United States (2001) Environ Health Perspect, 109 (SUPPL. 2), pp. 185-189; Kilbourne, E.M., Heat waves and hot environments (1997) The Public Health Consequences of Disasters, pp. 245-269. , Noji K, ed.
