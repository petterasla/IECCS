This study analyses the trends of annual and seasonal temperature, precipitation and streamflow series in Nenjiang River Basin. Correlations between streamflow and meteorological variables were investigated, while parametric method and nonparametric tests were applied to determine the trends and correlations. Data collected from a series of monitoring stations showed significant increasing trends of annual and seasonal mean temperature versus time, whereas during the whole period the annual and seasonal precipitation in the basin did not exhibit similar trends although temporal and spatial variations were detected. Affected by the precipitation and temperature changes, significant trends of decreasing annual, spring and autumn streamflow were demonstrated; the decrease concentrating mainly on the mainstream and tributaries of the left bank. Correlation analyses revealed strong relationships between the streamflow and meteorological variables in Nenjiang River Basin, and the impacts of climate change on streamflow were complicated. Results from this study will help water resource managers for decision makings that address the consequences of climate change. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Climate change; Correlation analysis; Nenjiang River Basin; Streamflow; Trend analysis","Correlation analysis; Global climate changes; Hydrological response; Meteorological variables; Monitoring stations; Nenjiang River Basin; Non-parametric test; Parametric method; Resource managers; River basins; Seasonal mean; Seasonal precipitations; Seasonal temperature; Temperature changes; Temporal and spatial variation; Trend analysis; Decision making; Rivers; Stream flow; Water resources; Watersheds; Climate change; air temperature; climate change; correlation; hydrological response; precipitation (climatology); river basin; streamflow; trend analysis; China; Nen River",,,,,,"Arnell, N.W., Climate change and global water resources (1999) Glob Environ Change, 9, pp. 31-49; Arora, M., Singh, P., Goel, N.K., Singh, R.D., Climate variability influences on hydrological responses of a large Himalayan basin (2008) Water Resour Manage, 22, pp. 1461-1475; Bian, J.M., Lin, N.F., Tang, J., Evolution and driving mechanism of runoff of Huolin River (2004) J Arid Land Resour Environ, 18 (4), pp. 105-108; Birsan, M.V., Molnar, P., Burlando, P., Pfaundler, M., Streamflow trends in Switzerland (2005) J Hydrol, 314, pp. 312-329; Burn, D.H., Hag Elnur, M.A., Detection of hydrological trends and variability (2002) J Hydrol (Amst), 255 (1-4), pp. 107-122; Du, S.M., Gong, W.F., Du, C., Du, C.X., Spatiotemporal change of desertification in lower reaches of Nenjiang River: a remote sensing analysis based on MODIS data (2009) J Nat Disasters, 18 (5), pp. 131-137; Gan, T.Y., Reducing vulnerability of water resources of canadian prairies to potential droughts and possible climatic warming (2000) Water Resour Manage, 14 (2), pp. 111-135; Gleick, P.H., A look at twenty-first century water resources development (2000) Water Int, 25 (1), pp. 127-138; Hao, X.M., Chen, Y.N., Xu, C.C., Li, W.H., Impacts of climate change and human activities on the surface runoff in the Tarim River Basin over the last fifty years (2008) Water Resour Manage, 22, pp. 1159-1171; Hupet, F., Vanclooster, M., Effect of the sampling frequency of meteorological variables on the estimation of the reference evapotranspiration (2001) J Hydrol, 243, pp. 192-204; Ju, H., Xiong, W., Xu, Y.L., Lin, E.D., Climate change and its impacts in Northeast China (2007) Chin Agric Sci Bull, 23 (4), pp. 345-349; Kendall, M.G., (1975) Rank Correlation Methods, , London: Griffin; Kohnova, S., Szolgay, J., Regional estimation of design flood discharges for river restoration in mountainous basins of northern Slovakia (2000) Flood Issues in Contemporary Water Management, pp. 41-47. , J.
