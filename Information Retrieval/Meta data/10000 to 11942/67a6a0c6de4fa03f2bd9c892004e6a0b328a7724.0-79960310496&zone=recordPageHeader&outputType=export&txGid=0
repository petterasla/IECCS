This increased ice sheet mass loss might be an evidence of global warming and could be related to elevated atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Here, we use the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate System Model version 3 to assess the potential influence of a shrinking Greenland Ice Sheet on the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC), the surface climate, and sea level in the next two centuries under the IPCC A1B scenario with prescribed rates of Greenland Ice Sheet melting. Results show that a low rate of Greenland melting will not significantly alter the MOC. However a moderate or high rate of Greenland melting does make the MOC weaken further. This further weakened MOC will not make the global climate in the next two centuries cooler than in the late 20th century, but will lessen the warming, especially in the northern high latitudes. Moreover, the sea level changes due to steric effect and ocean dynamics could potentially aggravate the sea level problem near the northeast North America coast and the islands in the western Pacific region. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation; Global temperature change; Greenland Ice Sheet; Sea level","20th century; Accelerated mass; Atlantic meridional overturning circulations; Atmospheric greenhouse; Gas concentration; Global climates; Global temperature change; Greenland; Greenland Ice Sheet; High Latitudes; High rate; Ice sheet; Low rates; Mass loss; Meridional overturning circulations; National center for atmospheric researches; Ocean dynamics; Sealevel change; Steric effect; Surface climate; Western Pacific; Climate models; Climatology; Glaciers; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Melting; Sea level; Ice; atmosphere-ice-ocean system; climate prediction; global climate; global warming; greenhouse gas; ice sheet; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; melting; meridional circulation; overturn; sea level change; thermohaline circulation; twentieth century; Arctic; Greenland; Greenland Ice Sheet; North America; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (West)",,,,,,"Alley, R.B., Clark, P.U., Huyberchts, P., Joughin, I., Ice-sheet and sea level changes (2005) Science, 310, pp. 456-460; Church, J.A., Changes in sea level (2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scietific Basis.
