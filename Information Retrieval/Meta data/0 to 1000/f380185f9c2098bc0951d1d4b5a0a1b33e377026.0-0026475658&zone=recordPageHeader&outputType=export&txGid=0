Some models explicitly consider the linkages between the economy and the energy sector (energy-economy models), while others focus on the energy sector in more detail (energy models). The paper discusses demand model inputs and outputs, time horizon, regional and sectoral disaggregation, energy consumer behaviour, energy using capital stock and energy efficiency improvements, and incorporating uncertainty. © 1992.","Energy demand; Environmental policy; Modelling","aggregate energy; demand model; energy source; global warming; policy assessment; simulation model",,,,,,"Huntington, Weyant, Sweeney, Modeling for insights, not numbersL the experiences of the Energy Modeling Forum (1982) Omega: The International Journal of Management Science, 10 (5), pp. 449-462. , The Energy Modeling Forum process for comparing models is explained in, Each EMF study is comprised of two major parts: (1) a comprehensive comparison of the model structure, and (2) an analysis of the major policy findings from comparing the model results.
