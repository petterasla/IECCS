It outlines both the historical and present day impact of EU legislation on UK practices and explains potential problems and benefits resulting from the implementation of the EU landfill directive. Basic waste data is given and some of the key factors underpinning waste regulation are delineated primarily sustainable development - but also land-use planning, groundwater protection and global climate change. The paper concludes by profiling the UK's lifecycle programme for waste management and its intended uses.","Biodegradable wastes; Global atmosphere; Groundwater protection; Landfilling; Life-cycle assessment; Sustainable development; UK","ground water; landfill; legislative implementation; waste management; atmosphere; climate; conference paper; European Union; land use; landfill; law; life cycle; priority journal; recycling; United Kingdom; waste management; United Kingdom; Biodegradation; Environmental protection; Global warming; Groundwater pollution; Land use; Laws and legislation; Life cycle; Regional planning; Sustainable development; Water pollution control; Life-cycle assessment (LCA); Waste management; Land fill",,,,,,"(1994) Climate Change: The UK Programme, , Cm 2427.
