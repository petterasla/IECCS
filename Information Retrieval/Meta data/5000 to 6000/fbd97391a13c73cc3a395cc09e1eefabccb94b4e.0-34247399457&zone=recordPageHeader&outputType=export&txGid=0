The insertion of a climate change factor into the economic C-D (Cobb-Dauglas) production function model yields a novel evaluation model, which connects the climate change factor to the economic variation factor, and the performance and reasonableness of the novel evaluation model are also preliminarily simulated and verified. © 2007 Science in China Press.","Agricultural economy; Climate change; Economy evaluation; Economy-climate model; Production function",,,,,,,"Ye, D.Z., Fu, C.B., Dong, W.J., Progresses and future trends of global change science (2002) Adv Earth Sci (in Chinese), 17 (4), pp. 467-469; Sinclair, T.R., Seligman, N.G., Crop modeling: From infancy to maturity (1996) Agron J, 88, pp. 698-704; Zhang, Y., Wang, F.T., On the possible impacts of climate warming on rice production in China (1998) Acta Meteorol Sin, 56 (3), pp. 369-376. , in Chinese; Yu, Q., Lu, P.L., Liu, J.D., Numerical analysis on crop light-temperature production model and the suitable growth season of rice in south China (1999) J Nat Sci (in Chinese), 14 (2), pp. 163-168; Gerrit, H.B., Roles of agrometeorology in crop production modeling and its application (2001) Zhejiang Meteorol Sci Tech, 22 (4), pp. 43-47. , Translated by Su G L, Deng F P, in Chinese; Wang, F.T., A preliminary study on the agrometeorological prediction model for wheat yields in China (1983) Chin Sci Bull, 29 (9), pp. 564-567. , in Chinese; Zhang, T., Wang, D., Analysis on effects of climatic oscillations on crop yields (1993) Influences of Climate Changes on Agriculture in China, pp. 419-466. , Deng G Y, ed, in Chinese, Beijing: Beijing Science and Technology Press; Tang, Z.C., Gao, P., A crop yield prediction system (1996) Agri Meteor China (in Chinese), 7 (2), pp. 49-52; Wang, J.L., Yang, F.Y., Song, Y.B., Method research for operational dynamic forecasting of maize yield in northwest of China (2004) J Appl Meteor Sci (in Chinese), 15 (1), pp. 51-57; Chou, J.M., Feng, G.L., Dong, W.J., An investigation on the evaluation of Chinese agricultural economy impacted by climate changes (2004) Clim Environl Res (in Chinese), 9 (2), pp. 597-603; Gu, H.Z., Wang, Z.P., Measurement of the contribution of agricultural technology progresses and its methods (1994) Jiangsu Soc Sci (in Chinese), 6, pp. 7-11; Huang, J.Q., Zheng, A.M., Application of the C-D production function in assessing economic growth (1995) Sys Eng (in Chinese), 15 (3), pp. 22-27; Cheng, B.W., Liu, S.M., Wu, X.M., A major property of C-D production (2001) Quant Technol Eco (in Chinese), 18 (1), pp. 78-80; Hui, F.L., Analysis of Production function (2000) Forum Statis Inform (in Chinese), 15 (6), pp. 19-22; Xu, L., Ma, D., On parameter estimation of the C-D production function (2001) Sci Technol Manag (in Chinese), 4, pp. 58-60","Chou, J.; Key Laboratory of Regional Climate-Environment Research for Temperate East Asia, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100029, China; email: c_jieming@tea.ac.cn",,,,,,,,10016538,,CSBUE,,"English","Chin.
