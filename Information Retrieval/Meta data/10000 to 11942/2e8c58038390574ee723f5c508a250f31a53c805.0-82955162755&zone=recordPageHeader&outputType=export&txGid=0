This convention is a plausible assumption for fast growing biomass species, but is inappropriate for slower growing biomass, like forests. In this case, the climate impact from biomass combustion can be potentially underestimated if CO2 emissions are ignored, or overestimated, if biogenic CO2 is considered equal to anthropogenic CO2. The estimation of the effective climate impact should take into account how the CO2 fluxes are distributed over time: the emission of CO2 from bioenergy approximately occurs at a single point in time, while the absorption by the new trees is spread over several decades. Our research target is to include this dynamic time dimension in unit-based impact analysis, using a boreal forest stand as case study. The boreal forest growth is modelled with an appropriate function, and is investigated under different forestry regimes (affecting the growth rate and the year of harvest). Specific atmospheric decay functions for biomass-derived CO2 are then elaborated for selected combinations of forest management options. The contribution to global warming is finally quantified using the GWPbio index as climate metric. Results estimates the effects of these practices on the characterization factor used for the global warming potential of CO2 from bioenergy, and point out the key role played by the selected time horizon. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Bioenergy; Boreal forest; CO2 emissions; Global warming","Bio-energy; Bio-energy systems; Biomass combustion; Biomass species; Boreal forests; Climate impacts; Decay function; Dynamic time; Global warming potential; Impact analysis; Life-cycle assessments; Single point; Time horizons; Biomass; Combustion; Ecology; Forestry; Global warming; Life cycle; Carbon dioxide; anthropogenic effect; bioenergy; biogenic emission; boreal forest; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; carbon sequestration; climate effect; combustion; forest management; global warming; life cycle analysis; management practice; phytomass; pollution control; Biomass; Carbon Dioxide; Climates; Combustion; E I S; Ecology; Emission; Energy; Forestry; Life Cycle",,,,,,"Bala, G., Caldeira, K., Wickett, M., Phillips, T.J., Lobell, D.B., Delire, C., Mirin, A., Combined climate and carbon-cycle effects of large-scale deforestation (2007) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 104, pp. 6550-6555; Bernesson, S., Nilsson, D., Hansson, P.-A., A limited LCA comparing large- and small-scale production of ethanol for heavy engines under Swedish conditions (2006) Biomass and Bioenergy, 30, pp. 46-57; Betts, R.A., Offset of the potential carbon sink from boreal forestation by decreases in surface albedo (2000) Nature, 408, pp. 187-190; Botha, T., von Blottnitz, H., A comparison of the environmental benefits of bagasse-derived electricity and fuel ethanol on a life-cycle basis (2006) Energy Policy, 34, pp. 2654-2661; Bracewell, R., The sifting property (1999) The Fourier Transform and Its Applications, pp. 74-77. , McGraw-Hill, New York; Börjesson, P., Gustavsson, L., Greenhouse gas balances in building construction: wood versus concrete from life-cycle and forest land-use perspectives (2000) Energy Policy, 28, pp. 575-588; Cherubini, F., Bird, N.D., Cowie, A., Jungmeier, G., Schlamadinger, B., Woess-Gallasch, S., Energy- and greenhouse gas-based LCA of biofuel and bioenergy systems: key issues, ranges and recommendations (2009) Resources Conservation and Recycling, 53, pp. 434-447; Cherubini, F., Peters, G., Berntsen, T., Strømman, A.H., Hertwich, E., CO2 emissions from biomass combustion for bioenergy: atmospheric decay and contribution to global warming Global Change Biology Bioenergy, , in press; Cherubini, F., Strømman, A.H., Life cycle assessment of bioenergy systems: state of the art and future challenges (2011) Bioresource Technology, 102, pp. 437-451; Crutzen, P.J., Mosier, A.R., Smith, K.A., Winiwarter, W., N2O release from agro-biofuel production negates global warming reduction by replacing fossil fuels (2007) Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics Discussion, 7, pp. 11191-11205; Feng, F.-L., Modelling stand growth vanes in response to different spacing (1997) Quarterly Journal of Experimental Forestry National Taiwan University, 11, pp. 111-123; Forster, P., Ramaswamy, V., Artaxo, P., Berntsen, T., Betts, R., Fahey, D.W., Haywood, J., Dorland, R.V., Changes in atmospheric constituents and in radiative forcing (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis, , Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Cambridge, UK, E.
