However, information on microbial communities involved in greenhouse gas emissions and their responses to drought remains sparse. We compared the gene abundance of eubacterial 16S rRNA, nitrite reductase (nirS) and methyl coenzyme M reductase (mcrA), and the diversity and composition of eubacteria, methanogens and denitrifiers among bog, fen and riparian wetlands. The gene abundance, diversity and composition significantly differed among wetlands (p < 0.01) with the exception of the diversity of methanogens. The gene abundance was ranked in the order of the bog = fen > riparian wetland, whereas the diversity was in the riparian wetland ≥ fen > bog. In addition, we conducted a short-term drought experiment and compared microbial communities between control (water-logged) and drought (-15 cm) treatments. Drought led to significant decline in the gene abundance in the bog (16S rRNA, nirS, mcrA) (p < 0.01) and fen (16S rRNA, nirS) (p < 0.05), but not in the riparian wetland. There were no differences in the diversity and composition of denitrifiers and methanogens at all sites following drought. Our results imply that denitrifiers and methanogens inhabiting bogs and fens would suffer from short-term droughts, but remain unchanged in riparian wetlands. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
