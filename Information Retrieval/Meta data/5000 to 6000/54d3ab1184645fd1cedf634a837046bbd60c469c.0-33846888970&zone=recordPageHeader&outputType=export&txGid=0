Both temperature and food quality may be variable. We scale up to the population level using natural mortality and a predation risk that is mass, vigilance, and temperature dependent. Simulations reveal the sensitivity of both survivorship and development time to risk and nutrient intake, including food quality and temperature variations. The model quantifies the crucial role of temperature in trophic interactions and development, which is an important issue in assessing the effects of global climate change on complex environmental interactions.","Eco-physiology; Grasshoppers; Temperature; Vigilance","enzyme; algorithm; animal; body temperature; chemistry; computer simulation; conference paper; ecosystem; insect; physiology; predation; risk; sensitivity and specificity; statistical model; statistics; systems biology; temperature; theoretical model; Algorithms; Animals; Body Temperature; Computer Simulation; Ecosystem; Enzymes; Insects; Models, Statistical; Models, Theoretical; Predatory Behavior; Risk; Sensitivity and Specificity; Stochastic Processes; Systems Biology; Temperature; Hexapoda",,"Enzymes",,,,"Ayers, M.P., Plant defense, herbivory and climate change (1993) Biotic Interactions and Global Change, pp. 79-94. , P.
