Future emissions from wood waste could be even higher if waste piles must be converted to landfills by soil capping in order to comply with national criteria for solid waste disposal. In order to estimate current and potential methane emission rates a set of field and laboratory measurements were undertaken. Gas samples for analysis of methane and CO2 were collected from the surface of sawdust piles using chambers placed on the pile surface, and at depths of 1.5, 3.0 and 4.6 m using a sampling probe. Two piles in each of the following age ranges were sampled: 0-1, 1-4, 3-5, and 5-8 years. In the laboratory study, sawdust samples from the 3.0 m depth were incubated under 20% CO2 in nitrogen at 32, 40 and 48°C to simulate the temperature range and anaerobic conditions occurring in typical sawdust piles. Field measurements indicated that methane comprised 20% of the biogas generated from sawdust piles. Emissions from the pile surface averaged 1.68 mg m-2 h-1 compared to literature estimates from landfills on the order of 0.125-125,000 mg m-2 h-1, with the low emission rates suggesting that a large percentage of the methane produced was either oxidized or otherwise consumed before reaching the pile surface. Emissions to the atmosphere estimated from annual sawdust production in the Tennessee Valley range from 15-44 metric tons per year. Incubation studies indicated highest methane generation at 32°C with a reduction in emissions in excess of 70% when the temperature was increased to 48°C. Estimates of methane production indicate that soil capping of disposed sawdust could increase methane production by 2-2.5 times over the biodegradation lifetime of the sawdust stored on-site. Assuming the global warming potential of methane is 21 times that of CO2, combustion of wood waste rather than on-site storage or capping would provide a CO2 offset of 1.2 or 3.8 tons, respectively, for each ton of sawdust burned.Gaseous emission rates from wood waste were analyzed by collecting samples of methane and carbon dioxide (CO2) from sawdust piles. The sawdust samples were incubated under 20% CO2 in nitrogen to simulate temperature range and anaerobic conditions. Field measurements showed 20% methane in the biogas produced from sawdust piles. Highest methane generation was observed at 32 °C, with reduced emissions in excess of 70% when temperature was increased to 48 °C. Soil capping of sawdust can increase methane production over the biodegradation lifetime of the sawdust stored on-site assuming the global warming potential of methane is 21 times that of CO2.","Anaerobic; Biodegradation; Biogas; Landfill; Methane; Sawdust; Wood waste","Biodegradation; Biogas; Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Land fill; Methane; Sawdust; Anaerobic conditions; Soil capping; Gas emissions; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrogen; carbon dioxide emission; methane emission; sawdust waste; article; biodegradation; combustion; greenhouse effect; landfill; priority journal; sampling; solid waste management; temperature; United States; wood; USA, Tennessee",,,,,,"Barlaz, M.A., Schaefer, D.M., Ham, R.K., Bacterial population development and chemical characteristics of refuse decomposition in a simulated sanitary landfill (1989) Appl.
