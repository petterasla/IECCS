Seagrasses provide key ecological services, including organic carbon production and export, nutrient cycling, sediment stabilization, enhanced biodiversity, and trophic transfers to adjacent habitats in tropical and temperate regions. They also serve as ""coastal canaries,"" global biological sentinels of increasing anthropogenic influences in coastal ecosystems, with large-scale losses reported worldwide. Multiple stressors, including sediment and nutrient runoff, physical disturbance, invasive species, disease, commercial fishing practices, aquaculture, overgrazing, algal blooms, and global warming, cause seagrass declines at scales of square meters to hundreds of square kilometers. Reported seagrass losses have led to increased awareness of the need for seagrass protection, monitoring, management, and restoration. However, seagrass science, which has rapidly grown, is disconnected from public awareness of seagrasses, which has lagged behind awareness of other coastal ecosystems. There is a critical need for a targeted global conservation effort that includes a reduction of watershed nutrient and sediment inputs to seagrass habitats and a targeted educational program informing regulators and the public of the value of seagrass meadows. © 2006 American Institute of Biological Sciences.","Decline; Ecological services; Monitoring; Seagrass; Sentinels","algae; Magnoliophyta",,,,,,"Abal, E.G., Dennison, W.C., Seagrass depth range and water quality in Southern Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia (1996) Marine and Freshwater Research, 47, pp. 763-771; Beck, M.W., The identification, conservation, and management of estuarine and marine nurseries for fish and invertebrates (2001) BioScience, 51, pp. 633-641; Beer, S., Koch, E.W., Photosynthesis of seagrasses vs. marine macroalgae in globally changing CO2 environments (1996) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 141, pp. 199-204; Berner, R.A., Kothavala, Z., GEOCARB III: A revised model of atmospheric CO2 over Phanerozoic time (2001) American Journal of Science, 301, pp. 182-204; Bricker, S.B., Ferreira, J.G., Simas, T., An integrated methodology for assessment of estuarine trophic status (2003) Ecological Modelling, 169, pp. 39-60; Bulthuis, D.A., Effects of in situ light reduction on density and growth of the seagrass Heterozostera tasmanica (Martens ex Aschers.) den Hartog in Western Port, Victoria, Australia (1983) Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, 67, pp. 91-103; Cambridge, M.L., McComb, A.J., The loss of seagrasses in Cockburn Sound, Western Australia, 1: The time course and magnitude of seagrass decline in relation to industrial development (1984) Aquatic Botany, 20, pp. 229-243; Carlton, J.T., Man's role in changing the face of the ocean: Biological invasions and implications for conservation of near-shore environments (1989) Conservation Biology, 3, pp. 265-273; Carlton, J.T., Vermeij, G., Lindberg, D.R., Carlton, D.A., Dudley, E.C., The first historical extinction of a marine invertebrate in an ocean basin: The demise of the eelgrass limpet, Lottia alveus (1991) Biological Bulletin, 180, pp. 72-80; Carruthers, T.J.B., Dennison, W.C., Longstaff, B.J., Waycott, M., Abal, E.G., McKenzie, L.J., Long, W.J.L., Seagrass habitats of Northeast Australia: Models of key processes and controls (2002) Bulletin of Marine Science, 71, pp. 1153-1169; Cohen, J.E., (1995) How Many People Can the Earth Support?, , New York: Norton; Coles, R.C., Fortes, M., Protecting seagrass-approaches and methods (2001) Global Seagrass Research Methods, pp. 445-463. , Short FT, Coles RG, eds.
