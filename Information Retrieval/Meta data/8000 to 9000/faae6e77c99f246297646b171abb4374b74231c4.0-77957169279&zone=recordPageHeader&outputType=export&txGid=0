Local climate change in the belt has affected the spatial patterns of surface air temperature (SAT). (1) There exist six major warmer centers with increasing rates of SAT from 0.28 to 0.54°C per decade during 1961-2006 along the belt, namely Yangzhou, Nanjing, Jiangyin, Shanghai, Hangzhou and Ningbo. As the greatest areas of human activities and rapid urbanization in the Yangtze River Delta, Shanghai metropolitan areas have the maximum rates of increases in annual and seasonal mean SAT, which range from 0.23 to 0.50°C per decade, and the strongest urban heat island effects, which are increasing at rates in the range of 0.11-0.15°C per decade. (2) Local warming and urban heat island effects have created the largest and warmest SAT core in the Shanghai metropolitan areas, contributing to spatial pattern changes in SAT over the Yangtze River Delta. The spatial patterns of SAT for 2001-2006 and 1971-2000 significantly differ in the typical latitudinal pattern for 1971-2000 that has changed, mainly in Shanghai metropolitan areas. (3) The annual mean of the regional SAT will increase from 15.4°C in 1961-1990 to 18.5°C in 2071-2100 due to global warming and urban heat island effects according to the IPCC SRES A2 Scenario. This increase is notably higher than the increment of 2.5°C from 15.4°C to 17.9°C due to global warming alone. The spatial distribution of the projected SAT with global warming and urban heat island effects is markedly different from that for global warming alone. In 2071-2100, the Shanghai metropolitan areas will have summer average temperatures of about 30.0-30.5°C, which are higher than summer average temperatures of about 28.7°C that would be expected from global warming alone. Higher average temperatures can have negative implications for energy and water consumption, human health and local ecosystems. The development and implementation of adaptation strategies are important and required by the policy makers from local government and city planning departments. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.",,"air temperature; climate change; global warming; heat island; human activity; metropolitan area; spatial analysis; spatial distribution; surface temperature; temperature anomaly; urbanization; China; Hangzhou; Shanghai; Yangtze Delta; Zhejiang",,,,,,"Cao, A.L., Zhang, H., Zhang, Y., Ma, W.C., Decadal changes of air temperature in Shanghai in recent 50 years and it's relation to urbanization (2008) Chinese Journal Geophysics, 51 (6), pp. 1663-1669. , (in Chinese); Chen, L.X., Zhu, W.Q., Zhou, X.J., Characteristics of environmental and climate change in Changjiang Delta and its possible mechanism (2000) Acta Meteorologica Sinica, 14 (1), pp. 129-140; Corburn, J., Cities, climate change and urban heat island mitigation: localizing global environmental science (2009) Urban Studies, 46 (2), pp. 413-427; Du, Y., Xie, Z.Q., Zeng, Y., Shi, Y.F., Wu, J.G., Impact of urban expansion on regional temperature change in the Yangtze River Delta (2007) Journal of Geographical Sciences; Easterling, D.R., Peterson, T.C., A new method for detecting and adjusting for undocumented discontinuities in climatological time series (1995) International Journal of Climatology, 15, pp. 369-377; Gao, R.X., Zhang, S.Y., Liu, B., Chow test based optimal piecewise modeling (1997) Information and Control, 26 (5), pp. 340-359. , (in Chinese); Gao, X., Shi, Y., Song, R., Giorgi, F., Wang, Y., Zhang, D., Reduction of future monsoon precipitation over China: comparison between a high resolution RCM simulation and the driving GCM (2008) Meteorology and Atmospheric Physics, 100, pp. 73-86; He, C.Y., Li, J.G., Chen, J., Shi, P.J., Pan, Y.Z., Li, J., Zhuo, L., Ichinose, T., The urbanization model a process in Bohai Sea surrounding area in the 1990s by using DMSP/OLS data (2005) Acta Geographica Sinica, 60 (3), pp. 409-417. , (in Chinese); He, C.Y., Shi, P.J., Li, J.G., Chen, J., Pan, Y.Z., Li, J., Zhuo, L., Ichinose, T., Restoring urbanization process in China in the 1990s by using non-radiance-calibrated DMSP/OLS nighttime light imagery and statistical data (2006) Chinese Science Bulletin, 51 (13), pp. 1614-1620; He, J.F., Zhuang, D.F., Analysis of the relationship between urban dynamic change pattern of the Yangtze River Delta and the regional eco-environment (2006) Geographical Research, 25 (3), pp. 388-396. , (in Chinese); Imhoff, M.L., Bounoua, L., DeFries, R., Lawrence, W.T., Stutzer, D., Tucker, C.J., Ricketts, T., The consequences of urban land transformation on net primary productivity in the United States (2004) Remote Sensing of Environment, 89, pp. 434-443; (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis, Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC, , Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Cambridge Univ.
