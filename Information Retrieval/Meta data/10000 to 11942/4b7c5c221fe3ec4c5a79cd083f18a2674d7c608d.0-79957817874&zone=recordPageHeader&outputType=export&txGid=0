The ""hypothesis of the oceanic earthquakes adjusting climate"" proposed by Guo Zeng-jian and the ""hypothesis of the tides adjusting climate"" proposed by Charles D. Keeling are a reasonable explanation. According to these theories, the globe temperature after 2005 will be lower. The low temperature and heavy snow occur in northern hemisphere from Nov 2009 to Jan 2010. Now western scientists also acknowledge the objective fact that the natural climate changes from 2000 to 2010 offset global warming effect. Lunar oscillations explain an intriguing 60-year cycle in the world s temperature. The great earlhquake in ocean and its margin can bring the cool water in the deep ocean up to the ocean surface and make the global climate cold. Sunspot and tide are closely related together, not only have same cycles, but also have one to one correspondence. In this paper, the relation of the strongest earthquake, the strongest tide, low temperature and Pacific Decade Oscillation are discussed.","Earthquakes; El Nino; La Nina; Lower temperature; Pacific decade oscillation; Tide","climate change; deep sea; El Nino; hypothesis testing; La Nina; low temperature; marginal sea; Northern Hemisphere; ocean tide; Pacific Decadal Oscillation; sea surface; snow; Sumatra earthquake 2004",,,,,,"Swanson, K.L., Tsonis, A.A., Has the climate recently shifted?
