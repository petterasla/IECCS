Most significant changes in the earth's temperature have been noticed since the advent of the industrial era in the late 1800s. Over the past 100 years, the earth's surface has warmed by approximately 0.6°C. Human activities such as the large-scale burning of fossil fuels to operate power plants and automobiles are releasing greenhouse gases like CO2 into the atmosphere at an unprecedented rate. Humans are currently releasing 70 million tonnes of CO2 per day into the atmosphere. This paper draws from the major papers that have appeared in journals on this topic over the past two decades, and gives an overview of anthropogenic climate change and its impact on a wide variety of life-forms in various ecosystems. After a brief overview of climate change and its causes, focus is given to amphibian extinctions in Central America, the poleward and altitudinal shifts in the distribution of various organisms (especially butterflies), the spread of pathogen-driven diseases, the bleaching of coral reefs, and the changes in community and trophic dynamics in various marine and terrestrial ecosystems. © International Society for Tropical Ecology.","Amphibian extinctions; Coral reefs; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Marine ecosystems; Terrestrial ecosystems","anthropogenic effect; biodiversity; climate change; climate effect; coral reef; extinction; global warming; greenhouse gas; human activity; power plant; Central America; Amphibia; Anthozoa; Papilionoidea",,,,,,"Beebe, T.J.C., Amphibian breeding and climate (1995) Nature, 374, pp. 219-220; Blaustein, A., Dobson, A., A message from the frogs (2006) Nature, 439, pp. 143-144; Both, C., Visser, M.E., Adjustment to climate change is constrained by arrival date in a long distance migrant bird (2001) Nature, 411, pp. 296-298; Both, C., Artemyev, A.V., Blaauw, B., Cowie, R.J., Dekhuijzen, A.J., Eeva, T., Enemar, A., Visser, M.E., Large-scale geographical variation confirms that climate change causes birds to lay earlier (2004) Proceedings of the Royal Biological Society, 271, pp. 1657-1667; Butler, C.J., The disproportionate effect of global warming on the arrival dates of short-distance migratory birds in North America (2003) Ibis, 145, pp. 484-495; Cicerone, R.J., (2006) Finding Climate Change and being Useful, , 6th National Conference on Science, Policy and the Environment, National Council for Science and the Environment, Washington, D.C; Corlett, T.T., LaFrankie Jr., J.V., Potential impacts of climate change on tropical Asian forests through and influence on phenology (1998) Climate Change, 39, pp. 439-454; Crick, H.Q.P., Sparks, T.H., Climate change related to egg laying trends (1999) Nature, 399, pp. 423-424; Crick, H.Q., Dudly, P.C., Glue, D.E., Thomson, D.L., UK birds are laying eggs earlier (1997) Nature, 388, p. 526; Cushing, D.H., (1995) Population Production and Regulation in the Sea: A Fisheries Perspective, , Cambridge University Press, U.K; Dunn, P.O., Winkler, D.W., Climate change has affected the breeding date of tree swallows throughout North America (1999) Nature, 266, pp. 2487-2490; Glynn, P.W., Coral reef bleaching in the 1980s and possible connections with global warming (1991) Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 6, pp. 175-179; Grabherr, G., Gottfried, M., Pauli, H., Climate effects on mountain plants (1994) Nature, 369, p. 448; Gore, A., (2006) An Inconvenient Truth: The Planetary Emergency of Global Warming and What We Can Do About it, , Rodale Publisher.
