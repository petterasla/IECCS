The intensity of precipitation extremes is widely held to increase proportionately to the increase in atmospheric water vapor content. Here, we show that this is not the case in 21st-century climate change scenarios simulated with climate models. In the tropics, precipitation extremes are not simulated reliably and do not change consistently among climate models; in the extratropics, they consistently increase more slowly than atmospheric water vapor content. We give a physical basis for how precipitation extremes change with climate and show that their changes depend on changes in the moist-adiabatic temperature lapse rate, in the upward velocity, and in the temperature when precipitation extremes occur. For the tropics, the theory suggests that improving the simulation of upward velocities in climate models is essential for improving predictions of precipitation extremes; for the extra-tropics, agreement with theory and the consistency among climate models increase confidence in the robustness of predictions of precipitation extremes under climate change.","Extreme events; Global warming; Hydrological cycle; Rainfall","adiabaticity; article; climate change; computer simulation; greenhouse effect; humidity; precipitation; priority journal; temperature sensitivity",,,,,,"Held, I.M., Soden, B.J., Robust responses of the hydrological cycle to global warming (2006) J Climate, 19, pp. 5686-5699; Kharin, V.V., Zwiers, F.W., Zhang, X., Hegerl, G.C., Changes in temperature and precipitation extremes in the IPCC ensemble of global coupled model simulations (2007) Journal of Climate, 20 (8), pp. 1419-1444. , DOI 10.1175/JCLI4066.1; Sun, Y., Solomon, S., Dai, A., Portmann, R.W., How often will it rain?
