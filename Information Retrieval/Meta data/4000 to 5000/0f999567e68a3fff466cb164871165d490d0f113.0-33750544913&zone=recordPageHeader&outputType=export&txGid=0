The length of the growing season is predicted to increase in response to increasing global temperatures. The object of this study was to evaluate different indices used for calculating the thermal growing season for the Greater Baltic Area (GBA). We included established indices of growing season start, end and length, as well as new and modified indices. Based on the results, the GBA can be divided into a maritime western part and a more continental eastern part, with the western part reacting more sensitively to the use of different indices. The eastern part is more stable, but even here the index-to-index differences are large. It was found that including or excluding a frost criterion had a significant influence on the initiation of the growing season in the western, maritime, parts of the GBA. Frost has not the same importance for the end of the growing season. However, some end indices can result in a ""never ending"" growing season. When looking at twentieth century trends in growing season parameters, it was found that, when averaged over the whole GBA, there was little difference in trends depending on the indices used. The general mean trend in the GBA for the twentieth century discloses an earlier onset of c. 12 days, a delayed end of c. 8 days and consequently a lengthening of the growing season of about 20 days. © 2006 ISB.","Greater baltic area; Thermal growing season; Twentieth-century trends","article; Europe; growth, development and aging; plant; season; temperature; time; Europe; Plants; Seasons; Temperature; Time Factors",,,,,,"Barford, C.C., Wofsy, S.C., Goulden, M.L., Munger, J.W., Pyle, E.H., Ubranski, S.P., Hutyra, L., Moore, K., Factors controlling long- and short-term sequestration of atmospheric CO2 in a mid-latitude forest (2001) Science, 294, pp. 1688-1691; Bootsma, A., Long term (100 yr) climate trends for agriculture at selected locations in Canada (1994) Clim Change, 26, pp. 65-88; Carter, T.R., Changes in the thermal growing season in Nordic countries during the past century and prospects for the future (1998) Agric Food Sci Finn, 7, pp. 161-179; Chmielewski, F.-M., Rötzer, T., Annual and spatial variability of the beginning of growing season in Europe in relation to air temperature changes (2002) Clim Res, 19, pp. 257-264; Fitter, A.H., Fitter, R.S.R., Rapid changes in flowering time in British plants (2002) Science, 296, pp. 1689-1691; Førland, E.J., Skaugen, T.E., Benestad, R.E., Hanssen-Bauer, I., Tveito, O.E., Variations in thermal growing, heating, and freezing indices in the nordic arctic, 1900-2050 (2004) Arct Antarct Alp Res, 36, pp. 347-356; Frich, P., Alexander, L.V., Della-Marta, P., Gleason, B., Haylock, M., Klein Tank, A.M.G., Peterson, T., Observed coherent changes in climatic extremes during the second half of the twentieth century (2002) Clim Res, 19, pp. 193-212; Heino, R., (1994) Climate in Finland during the Period of Meteorological Observations, , Finnish Meteorological Institute Contributions, No. 12, Finnish Meteorological Institute; Jones, P.D., Briffa, K.R., Growing season temperatures over the former Soviet Union (1995) Int J Climatol, 15, pp. 943-959; Jones, P.D., Lister, D.H., The daily temperature record for St. Petersburg (2002) Clim Change, 53, pp. 253-267; Jones, P.D., Briffa, K.R., Osborn, T.J., Moberg, A., Bergström, H., Relationships between circulation strength and the variability of growing-season and cold-season climate in northern and central Europe (2002) Holocene, 12, pp. 643-656; Keeling, C.D., Chin, J.F.S., Whorf, T.P., Increased activity of northern vegetation inferred from atmospheric CO2 measurements (1996) Nature, 382, pp. 146-149; Kiktev, D., Sexton, D.M.H., Alexander, L., Folland, C., Comparison of modeled and observed trends in indices of daily climate extremes (2003) J Climate, 16, pp. 3560-3571; Klein Tank, A.M.G., Daily dataset of 20th-century surface air temperature and precipitation series for the European Climate Assessment (2002) Int J Climatol, 22, pp. 1441-1453; Menzel, A., Phenology, its importance to the global change community.
