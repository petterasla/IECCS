Previous attempts to estimate the integrated climate forcing per unit CO2 emitted have focused on perturbations to steady-state conditions in carbon-cycle models. But for non-steady-state conditions, the integrated climate forcing from a CO2 perturbation depends both on the initial conditions and on future atmospheric CO2 concentrations. As atmospheric CO2 concentrations increase, the radiative forcing per unit CO2 emitted will become smaller because the strongest absorption bands will already be saturated. At the same time, higher concentrations of dissolved carbon in the surface ocean will reduce the ocean's ability to absorb excess CO2 from the atmosphere. Each of these effects taken alone would affect the climate forcing from a pulse of emitted CO2 by a factor of three or more; but here we show that, taken together, they compensate for each other. The net result is that the global warming potential of CO2 relative to other radiatively active trace gases is nearly independent of the CO2 emission scenario. Thus, the concept of the global warming potential remains useful, despite the nonlinearities in the climate system and uncertainties in future emissions.",,"Air pollution; Atmospheric composition; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Carbon dioxide; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Heat radiation; Mathematical models; Anthropogenic gas emissions; Carbon cycle models; Carbon dioxide emissions; Global warming potentials; Radiative climate forcing; Radiatively active trace gases; Climatology; carbon dioxide; climate forcing; emission scenario; global warming potential; warming",,,,,,,"Caldelra, K.; Global Climate Research Division, Lawrence Livermore Natl.
