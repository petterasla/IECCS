Unfortunately, our current policies do not require or reward broadly sustainably and truly low-carbon biomass. What's more, the small policy steps forward are under atttack and the comprehensive policy solutions are not even being debated. As a result, any supply estimate that does not start by identifying the policies that would guide the market to choose sustainably managed feedstocks in sustainable quantities can be nothing more than a proof of concept, technical assessment. These estimates are misleadingly high in the current policy climate. Nevertheless to stop global warming we must try to get the right policies in place and with an aggressive package of policies, they might actually turn out to be low. A modest proposal for a billion gallon challenge with rich incentives and rigorous environmental requirements (perhaps building of voluntary sustainability certification standards such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels) is offered as a way to launch the advanced biofuels industry on the right track in a way will build public support. © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Biofuels; Biomass; Climate; Policy; Sustainability","Certification standards; Climate; Environmental requirement; Low-carbon; Policy; Proof of concept; Public support; Sustainability; Technical assessment; Biomass; Global warming; Standardization; Sustainable development; Biofuels",,,,,,"Arndt, D.S., Baringer, M.O., Johnson, M.R., State of the Climate in 2009 (2010) Bull Amer Meteorol Soc, 91 (6), pp. S1-S224. , and (eds); Dale, B.E., Blazing a trail for the 'green and narrow way.'
