A hydrocarbon-rich microalga, Botryococcus braunii, produced hydrocarbons and consumed nitrate and phosphate in STS. Removal effects of the alga regarding As, Cd and Cr were observed during these experiments with an artificial medium. As for oil recovery from algal cells, the maximum yield of oil obtained by liquefaction was 64 wt% on a dry basis at 300°C with a catalyst of sodium carbonate. © 1995.",,"Algae; Biological sewage treatment; Carbonates; Catalysts; Chemicals removal (water treatment); Hydrocarbons; Liquefaction; Nitrates; Phosphates; Sodium compounds; Botryococcus braunii; Carbon dioxide fixation; Microalgal oil production; Secondarily treated sewage; Sodium carbonate catalyst; Thermochemical oil recovery; Carbon dioxide",,,,,,"Wake, Hillen, Study of a ?bloom? of the oil-rich algaBotryococcus braunii in the Darwin River Reservoir (1980) Biotechnology and Bioengineering, 22, p. 1637; Casadevall, Dif, Largeau, Gudin, Chaumont, Desanti, (1985) Biotechnol.
