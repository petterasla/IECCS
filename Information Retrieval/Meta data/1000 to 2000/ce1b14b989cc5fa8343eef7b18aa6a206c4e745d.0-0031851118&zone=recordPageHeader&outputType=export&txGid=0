Freezing began in the leaf midvein, consistent with it being a major site of frost damage under field conditions. The average ice nucleation temperature was higher in leaves grown under elevated [CO2] (-5.7 °C versus - 4.3 °C), consistent with the greater incidence of frost damage in these leaves (34% versus 68% of leaves damaged). These results have major implications for agriculture, forestry and vegetation dynamics, as an increase in frost susceptibility may reduce potential gains in productivity from CO2 fertilization and may affect predictions of vegetation change based on increasing temperature.","Elevated atmospheric [CO2]; Eucalyptus pauciflora; Freeze-induced damage; Global climate change; Ice nucleation; Open-top chambers","carbon dioxide enrichment; frost hardiness; seedling; tree; Eucalyptus pauciflora",,,,,,"Ashenden, T.W., Baxter, R., Rafarel, C.R., An inexpensive system for exposing plants in the field to elevated concentrations of CO2 (1992) Plant, Cell and Environment, 15, pp. 365-372; Ball, M.C., Egerton, J.J.G., Leuning, R., Cunningham, R.B., Dunne, P., Microclimate above grass adversely affects spring growth of seedling snow gum (Eucalyptus pauciflora) (1997) Plant, Cell and Environment, 20, pp. 155-166; Boden, T.A., Kaiser, D.P., Sepanski, R.J., Stoss, F.W., (1994) Trends '93: A Compendium of Data on Global Change, , Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge; Boese, S.R., Wolfe, D.A., Melkonian, J.J., Elevated CO2 mitigates chilling-induced water stress and photosynthetic reduction during chilling (1997) Plant, Cell and Environment, 20, pp. 625-632; Cannell, M.G.R., Smith, R.I., Climatic warming, spring budburst and frost damage on trees (1986) Journal of Applied Ecology, 23, pp. 177-191; Davidson, N.J., Reid, J.B., Frost as a factor influencing the growth and distribution of subalpine eucalypts (1985) Australian Journal of Botany, 33, pp. 657-667; Fuchs, M., Tanner, C.B., Infrared thermometry of vegetation (1966) Agronomy Journal, 58, pp. 597-601; (1993) Genstat 5 Release 3 Reference Manual, , Oxford, Clarendon Press; Harwood, C.E., Frost resistance of subalpine Eucalypts species.
