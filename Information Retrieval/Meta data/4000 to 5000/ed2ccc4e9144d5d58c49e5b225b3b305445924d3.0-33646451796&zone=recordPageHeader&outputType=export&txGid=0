The indirect effects of climate warming, including changes to the availability of key environmental resources, such as water and nutrients, are likely to have a greater impact upon continental Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems than the effects of fluctuations in temperature alone. To investigate the likely impacts of a wetter climate on Antarctic terrestrial communities a multiseason, manipulative field experiment was conducted in the floristically important Windmill Islands region of East Antarctica. Four cryptogamic communities (pure bryophyte, moribund bryophyte, crustose and fructicose lichen-dominated) received increased water and/or nutrient additions over two consecutive summer seasons. The increased water approximated an 18% increase in snow melt days (0.2°C increase in temperature), while the nutrient addition of 3.5g N m-2 yr-1 was within the range of soil N in the vicinity. A range of physiological and biochemical measurements were conducted in order to quantify the community response. While an overall increase in productivity in response to water and nutrient additions was observed, productivity appeared to respond more strongly to nutrient additions than to water additions. Pure bryophyte communities, and lichen communities dominated by the genus Usnea, showed stronger positive responses to nutrient additions, identifying some communities that may be better able to adapt and prosper under the ameliorating conditions associated with a warmer, wetter future climate. Under such a climate, productivity is overall likely to increase but some cryptogamic communities are likely to thrive more than others. Regeneration of moribund bryophytes appears likely only if a future moisture regime creates consistently moist conditions. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","δ13C; Bryophytes; Chlorophyll; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Community ecology; Ecophysiology; Lichens; Nitrogen; Phosphorous; Stableisotopes","bryophyte; chlorophyll; climate change; community response; ecological impact; ecophysiology; environmental conditions; flora; global change; lichen; nutrient cycling; water availability; Antarctica; East Antarctica; Windmill Islands; Bryophyta; bryophytes; Usnea",,,,,,"Arnold, R.J., Convey, P., Hughes, K.A., Seasonal periodicity of physical factors, inorganic nutrients and microalgae in Antarctic fellfields (2003) Polar Biology, 26, pp. 396-403; BassiriRad, H., Constable, J.V.H., Lussenhop, J., Widespread foliage delta N-15 depletion under elevated CO2: Inferences for the nitrogen cycle (2003) Global Change Biology, 9, pp. 1582-1590; Bates, J.W., Thompson, K., Grime, J.P., Effects of simulated long-term climatic change on the bryophytes of a limestone grassland community (2005) Global Change Biology, 11, pp. 757-769; Beyer, L., Bölter, M., Formation, ecology and geography of cryosols of an ice-free oasis in coastal East Antarctica near Casey Station (Wilkes Land) (1998) Australian Journal of Soil Research, 37, pp. 209-244; Bottger, T., Schidlowski, M., Wand, U., Stable carbon isotope fractionation in lower plants from the Schirmacher and Untersee oases (Central Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica) -(Preliminary Report) (1993) Isotopenpraxis, 29, pp. 21-25; Bragazza, L., Limpens, J., Gerdol, R., Nitrogen concentration and delta N-15 signature of ombrotrophic Sphagnum mosses at different N deposition levels in Europe (2005) Global Change Biology, 11, pp. 106-114; Broady, P.A., Broadscale patterns in the distribution of aquatic and terrestrial vegetation at three ice-free regions on Ross Island, Antarctica (1989) Hydrobiologia, 172, pp. 77-95; Chapin III, F.S., Direct and indirect effects of temperature on Arctic plants (1983) Polar Biology, 2, pp. 47-52; Chapin III, F.S., Shaver, G.R., Giblin, A.E., Responses of arctic tundra to experimental and observed changes in climate (1995) Ecology, 76, pp. 694-711; Clesceri, L.S., Greenberg, A.E., Eaton, A.D., (1998) Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, , (eds) 20th edn.
