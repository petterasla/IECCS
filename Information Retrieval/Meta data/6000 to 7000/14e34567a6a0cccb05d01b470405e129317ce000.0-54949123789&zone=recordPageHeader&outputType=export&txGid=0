Previous studies have generally focussed on the effects on pre-industrial climate. Here we take into account increased greenhouse gas concentrations according to an IS92a emissions scenario. THC shutdown causes cooling of the Northern Hemisphere of -1.7°C, locally stronger. Over western Europe cooling is strong enough for a return to pre-industrial conditions and a significant increase in the occurrence of frost and snow cover. Global warming restricts the increase in sea ice cover after THC shutdown. This lessens the amount of cooling over NW Europe, but increases it over North America, compared to pre-industrial shutdown. This reflects a non-linearity in the local temperature response to THC shutdown. Precipitation change after THC shutdown is generally opposite to that caused by global warming, except in western and southern Europe, where summer drying is enhanced, and in Central America and southeast Asia, where precipitation is also further reduced. Local rise in sea level after THC shutdown can be large along Atlantic coasts (±25,cm), which would add to the rise caused by global warming. Potentially rapid THC shutdown adds to the range of uncertainty of projected future climate change. © 2007 British Crown.",,"Atmospherics; Climatology; Cooling; Dewatering; Forestry; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Leakage (fluid); Oceanography; Precipitation (meteorology); Sea ice; Sea level; Water levels; Atlantic coasts; Central america; Climate impacts; Climate models; Future climates; Greenhouse gas concentrations; Ice covers; Industrial conditions; Local temperatures; Non-linearity; North America; Northern hemispheres; Precipitation changes; Snow covers; Southeast asia; Southern Europe; Summer drying; Thermohaline circulations; Western Europe; Climate change; climate modeling; environmental response; global warming; greenhouse gas; Northern Hemisphere; precipitation (climatology); sea level change; snow cover; thermohaline circulation; twenty first century",,,,,,"Allen, M.R., Ingram, W.J., Constraints on future changes in climate and the hydrologic cycle (2002) Nature, 419, pp. 224-232; Church, J.A., Gregory, J.M., Huybrechts, P., Kuhn, M., Lambeck, K., Nhuan, M.T., Qin, D., Woodworth, P.L., Changes in sea level (2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis.
