In the USA, a debate has swirled about whether a consensus on climate change exists among reputable scientists and this has entered the policy process. In order to better understand the views of US climate scientists, we conducted an empirical survey of US climate scientists (N = 468) in 2005, and compared the results with the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) physical science report and policy summaries. Our results reveal that survey respondents generally agree about the nature, causes, and consequences of climate change, and are in agreement with IPCC findings. We also found that there is strong support for a variety of policy initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Climate scientists; Global climate changes; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Physical science; Policy initiatives; Policy process; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Surveys; climate change; emission control; environmental policy; global climate; greenhouse gas; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; survey; United States",,,,,,"(2007) The Environment, , http://www.eesi.org/briefings/2007/Energy%20&%20Climate/5-4-07_Climate_polling/GW%202007%20ABC%20News%20Release.pdf, ABC News, Washington Post, and Stanford Poll; Agrawala, S., Adaptation, development assistance and planning: Challenges and opportunities (2004) IDS Bull, 35 (PART 3), pp. 50-54; Bell, J., Sloan, L., Snyder, M., Regional changes in extreme climatic events: A future climate scenario (2004) J Climate, 17 (1), pp. 81-87; Bray, D., Krück, C., Some patterns of interaction between science and policy: Germany and climate change (2001) Clim Res, 19, pp. 69-90; Burkey, J., Harris, T., Impacts of privatization: Use of multimodal survey (2006) Soc Sci J, 43 (4), pp. 617-628; Gaffney, J., Marley, N., New Directions: Uncertainties of aerosol effects in global climate models (1998) Atmos Environ, 32 (16), pp. 2873-2874; Gore-Felton, C., Koopman, C., Bridges, E., Thoresen, C., Spiegel, D., An example of maximizing survey return rates: Methodological issues for health professionals (2002) Eval Health Prof, 25 (2), pp. 152-168; Griffin, M., (2007) NASA chief questions urgency of global warming, , http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10571499, Interview with National Public Radio, 31 May; (2007) Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report, , www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/syr/ar4_syr_spm.pdf, IPCC, Summary for policymakers from http; (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis.
