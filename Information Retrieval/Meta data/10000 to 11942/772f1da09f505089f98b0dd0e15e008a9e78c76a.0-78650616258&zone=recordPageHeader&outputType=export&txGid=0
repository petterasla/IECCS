The current level of concern for the environment is at an all time high, therefore, it is important to look into methods and resources that lead to a cleaner and healthier future for the planet. This study details one such effort to reach this goal, focusing on condensation of carbon dioxide as a natural refrigerant in refrigeration systems. Three brazed plate heat exchangers with different geometry, each consisting of three channels, are tested. This paper focuses on the two-phase analysis, where carbon dioxide was the working fluid, flowing through the middle channel, and dynalene brine, the cooling fluid, flowed through the side channels of each geometry. Condensation of carbon dioxide occurred at saturation temperatures ranging from -17.8 °C to -34.4 °C and heat fluxes spanning 2.5-15.7 kW/m2. An in-depth dimensional analysis was completed on the two-phase data yielding heat transfer correlations. Relationships of the two-phase heat transfer characteristics are presented, the data are compared with related studies, and conclusions are made from the two-phase data. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
