The globally averaged sea level rise attributable to the steric contribution was 23 and 30 cm for the two scenarios. The results of the high-resolution model and a medium-resolution version of the same model for global and local sea level change agreed well. However, the high-resolution model represented more detailed ocean structure changes under global warming. The changes affected not only the spatial distribution of sea level rise, but also the changes in local sea level variability associated with ocean eddies. The enhanced eddy activity was responsible for extreme sea level events.
