The test method has been constructed using wavelet analysis which has the ability of decomposing a time series into low frequencies (trend) and high-frequency (noise) components. Under the normality assumption, the test is distributed as F. However, using generated empirical critical values, the properties of the test statistic have been investigated under different conditions and different types of wavelet. The Harr wavelet has shown to exhibit the highest power among the other wavelet types. The methodology here has been applied to real temperature data in Sweden for the period 1850-1999. The results indicate a significant increasing trend which agrees with the 'global warming' hypothesis during the last 100 years.","Global warming; Trend; Wavelet analysis",,,,,,,"Beran, J., (1994) Statistical Methods for Long Memory Processes, , Chapman & Hall, London; Bloomfield, P., Nychka, D.W., Climate spectra and detecting climate change (1992) Climatic Change, 21, pp. 275-287; Brillinger, D.R., Some uses of cumulants in wavelet analysis (1996) Nonparametric Stat., 6, pp. 93-114; Daubechies, I., (1992) CBMS-NFS Regional Conference Series in Applied Mathematics Ten Lectures on Wavelets, 61. , Philadelphia; Hosking, J.R.M., Modelling persistence in hydrological time series using fractional differencing (1984) Water Resources Res., 20, pp. 1898-1908; Mallat, S.G., A theory for multiresolution signal decomposition: The wavelet representation (1989) IEEE Trans.
