Box 351, H-1394 Budapest, Hungary","On the basis of the climate scenarios downscaled to Hungary from the IPCC Report (IPCC, 2007) by Bartholy et al. (2007), we performed sensitivity analyses on air temperature in maize canopy. We created the scenario for 2071-2100 by using Goudriaan's (1977) simulation model (Crop Microclimate Simulation Model, CMSM). We selected eight scenarios including the control (1961-1990), one of them examined the changes of the past decade, another one did the impacts of the doubled atmospheric CO2 concentration. The remaining five scenarios contained different degrees of warming-up beside the doubled atmospheric CO2 concentration as it follows: scenarios with +3.8, +4.8, +6.0, and two ones with +9.0 °C; the latter two differed only in the quantity of precipitation. Each approach increased the air temperature in maize canopy depending on the degree of warming-up. The changes already occurring in the environmental factors in the past decade increased the air temperature at cob level by 0.6 °C. The presence of plant canopy, however, mitigated the degree of warming-up, likely owing to the shadowing effect of the canopy. We should not ignore the fact that the compensating effect of the canopy depends on the canopy structure determined by the humidity supply. The analysis results made available local level information for the potential users that can provide apparent help in the preparation for the mitigation of adverse impacts of the expected changes.","Air temperature; Maize canopy; Simulation model","air temperature; carbon dioxide; climate change; climate effect; climate variation; computer simulation; concentration (composition); downscaling; environmental factor; future prospect; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; maize; sensitivity analysis; soil temperature; Zea mays",,,,,,"Anda, A., Modeling maize response to climate modification in Hungary (2006) Commun.
