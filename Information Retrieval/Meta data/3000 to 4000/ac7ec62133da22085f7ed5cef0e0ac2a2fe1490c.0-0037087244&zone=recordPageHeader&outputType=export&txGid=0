The use of three techniques (dynamic closed chambers, static chambers, and gradient calculations) to determine soil respiration was assessed by measuring fluxes of microbially produced CO2 from an unsaturated mesocosm (2.4 m dia. × 3.2 m thick) and two unsaturated minicosms (0.58 m dia. × 1.2 m thick), one maintained at 18-23°C (HT) and the other at 5°C (LT). By injecting known and constant CO2 fluxes into the bottom of the HT minicosm and measuring the resulting fluxes, it was shown that the dynamic closed chamber (DCCS) technique yielded accurate measurements of fluxes over the range observed from natural unsaturated media. Over this same range, results showed that the concentration gradient method yielded reasonable estimates of fluxes but its accuracy was limited by uncertainties in both the concentration gradient and the gaseous diffusion coefficient in the soil atmosphere. The static chamber method underestimated the actual flux at higher CO2 fluxes and when adsorption times of &gt;24 h were used. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.
