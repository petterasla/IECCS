The measurements were completed at a frequency of 137 GHz. Small amounts (about 2 mL) of freshwater or saltwater were frozen over a Peltier cooler and the freezing and melting sequence was recorded. Saltwater was prepared in the laboratory that contained 3.5% of table salt to simulate the ocean water. The dynamics of freezing-melting was observed by measuring the millimeter wave temperature as well as the changes in the ice or water surface reflectivity and position. This was repeated using large amounts of freshwater and saltwater (800 mL) mimicking glaciers. Millimeter wave surface level fluctuations indicated as the top surface melted, the light ice below floated up indicating lower surface temperature until the ice completely melted. Our results are useful for remote sensing and tracking temperature for potentially large-scale environmental applications, e.g., global warming. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Freezing; Fresh/sea water; Global warming; Melting; Millimeter wave reflectivity; Remote sensing","Environmental applications; Fresh/sea water; Level fluctuations; Melting dynamics; Millimeter-wave radiometries; Non contacts; Ocean waters; Peltier coolers; Surface temperatures; Table salts; Top surfaces; Water surfaces; Dynamics; Freezing; Global warming; Ice; Melting; Millimeter wave devices; Ocean engineering; Oceanography; Reflection; Remote sensing; Sodium chloride; Millimeter waves",,,,,,"Cumming, W.A., The dielectric properties of ice and snow at 3.2 centimeters (1952) Journal of Applied Physics, 23 (7), pp. 768-773; Perry, J., Straiton, A.W., Dielectric constant of ice 35.3 and 94.5 GHz (1972) Journal of Applied Physics, 43 (2), pp. 731-733; Perry, J., Straiton, A.W., Revision of dielectric-constant of ice in millimeter-wave spectrum (1973) Journal of Applied Physics, 44 (11), pp. 5180-5180; Vant, M.R., Gray, R.B., Ramseier, R.O., Makios, V., Dielectric properties of fresh and sea ice at 10 and 35 GHz (1974) Journal of Applied Physics, 45 (11), pp. 4712-4717; Christian, M., Urs, W., DIELECTRIC PROPERTIES of FRESH-WATER ICE at MICROWAVE FREQUENCIES.
