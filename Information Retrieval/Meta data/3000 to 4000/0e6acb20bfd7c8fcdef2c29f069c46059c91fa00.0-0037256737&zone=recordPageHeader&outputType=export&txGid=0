With the rise in temperatures through global warming, and the use of central heating and air conditioning, this seasonal variation may be declining. Aim: To study possible changes in seasonal variation in case-fatality rates of myocardial infarction (MI), in men and women, over a 20-year period and compare this with possible environmental influences. Design: Retrospective analysis of death certificate and climatological data. Methods: We analysed all monthly death certificate data from Northern Ireland, for death caused by MI from 1979 through 1998 (n = 68 683). Mortality data were standardized to a single reference group for the whole period. Seasonal variation in mortality and in environmental variables was described using the cosinor model. Results: A total of 29 875 women and 38 808 men died from MI during the 20-year period. A significant decrease in mortality from MI was observed in both sexes, accompanied by a non-significant decline in the amplitude of the seasonal rhythm over the study period. Low temperature was associated with higher mortality rates from MI. Discussion: We have documented an overall decline in cardiovascular mortality from 1979 to 1998, together with a small but non-significant decrease in seasonal variation. While improvements in medical care, lifestyle, housing and diet may have contributed to the observed decline in mortality rate, seasonal fluctuations remain a significant problem.",,"air conditioning; article; cardiovascular disease; cause of death; controlled study; data analysis; death certificate; diet; environmental factor; fatality; female; greenhouse effect; heart infarction; heating; housing; human; lifestyle; low temperature; major clinical study; male; medical documentation; morbidity; mortality; patient care; priority journal; retrospective study; seasonal variation; statistical model; United Kingdom; winter; Female; Humans; Male; Mortality; Myocardial Infarction; Northern Ireland; Registries; Retrospective Studies; Seasons; Sex Distribution; Sunlight; Temperature",,,,,,"Wolff, L., White, P.D., Acute coronary occlusion (1926) Boston Med.
