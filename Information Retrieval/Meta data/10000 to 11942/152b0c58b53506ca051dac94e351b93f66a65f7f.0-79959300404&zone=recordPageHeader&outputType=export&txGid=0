This paper presents the design and description of a single chambered experimental model for cold generation based on pressure swing adsorption mechanism with an objective to propose a feasible refrigeration system to replace halogenated refrigerants. Granular activated carbon (ACG-825-1.5) manufactured indigenously from matured coconut shell and carbon dioxide has been used as representative adsorbent-adsorbate pair. Refrigerating effect and coefficient of performance for the system have been investigated and were found to be 120.61. J/s and 3.014 respectively. The model successfully produced chilled water at 4 °C (277. K) from ambient water available at 26 °C (299. K). Details of the experimental results and adsorption-desorption isotherm for the system has been described. This work also highlights a novel method of capturing carbon dioxide by utilizing it as an adsorbate in such a refrigeration system. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Activated carbon; Carbon dioxide; Chlorofluorocarbons; Pressure swing adsorption; Refrigeration","Adsorption desorption isotherms; Ambient waters; Chilled water; Coconut shells; Coefficient of Performance; Cold generation; Experimental investigations; Experimental models; Granular activated carbons; Novel methods; Ozone layer depletion; Pressure swing adsorption; Refrigeration system; Activated carbon; Adsorbates; Adsorption; Carbon dioxide; Chlorofluorocarbons; Desorption; Global warming; Halogenation; Ozone; Ozone layer; Pressure effects; Refrigerants; Refrigerators; Refrigeration",,,,,,"Mohanraj, M., Jayaraj, S., Muraleedharan, C., Environment friendly alternatives to halogenated refrigerants - a review (2009) Int.
