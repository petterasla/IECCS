Fifteen works have been studied, representing a range of size and type of treatment works. Five management regimes for centralising sludge treatment and disposal were analyzed in the context of LCA to provide guidance on choosing the best practicable environmental option (BPEO). Consideration of Global warming potential indicates that the four proposed management regimes with centralisation of sludge for treatment and disposal, as adopted by Thames Water Utilities Ltd., is an environmental improvement upon the current practice. One of these options, that of complete centralisation and composting of sludge prior to disposal, exerts the least environmental impact with respect to Global warming potential. This suggests that the adoption of composting at Crawley is environmentally preferable to increasing the digestion facility at this works.","Life cycle assessment; Management; Sludge disposal; Wastewater treatment","Best practicable environmental option; Life cycle assessment; Environmental impact; Life cycle; Sludge digestion; Sludge disposal; Wastewater treatment; wastewater; water management; water treatment plant; life cycle analysis; waste management; wastewater; water quality; conference paper; greenhouse effect; life cycle; pollution; sludge disposal; United Kingdom; waste water management; United Kingdom",,,,,,,"Dennison, F.J.; Thames Water Utilities Ltd, Spencer House, Manor Farm Road, Reading RG2 0JN, United Kingdom",,,,"Proceedings of the 1998 19th Biennial Conference of the International Association on Water Quality.
