The ability to predict phytomass components from commonly available inventory data would facilitate our understanding of the latter. We focus on Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands in Russia, with the objective of predicting stand phytomass (Mg ha -1) for the four major stand components: needles, crown, stems, and roots. The study area includes regions in Russia where Scots pine is a stand-forming species: from European Russia (33°E) to Yakutia (130°E) in eastern Siberia. To ensure that results will be widely applicable, only variables consistently measured in forest inventories were considered as possible predictors: stand age, site quality class, and stocking (stand stem volume with bark, m 3 ha -1). Stand phytomass data were obtained from numerous regional and local phytomass studies, and supplemented with additional unpublished data. This is the first comprehensive study synthesizing stand level phytomass relations for P. sylvestris for most of its range in Russia. The combined results from over 18 regional and local phytomass studies provide a level of generality that is not possible with individual local studies. In addition to estimating stand phytomass components across a wide range of conditions, these phytomass models can also be used to verify carbon allocation rules in process-based models.","Biomass; Carbon allocation; Carbon cycle; Scots pine; Stand modeling",,,,,,,"Atkin, A.S., (1984) Phytomass and Exchange of Substances in Pine Forests, , Institute of Forest and Wood, USSR Academy of Sciences, Siberian Branch, Krasnoyarsk, 132 pp. (In Russian); Dixon, R.K., Meldahl, R.S., Ruark, G.A., Warren, W.G., (1990) Process Modeling of Forest Growth Responses to Environmental Stress, , Timber Press, Portland, OR, 441 pp; Draper, N.R., Smith, H., (1981) Applied Regression Analysis, 2nd Edn., , John Wiley, New York, 709 pp; Gabeev, V.S., (1976) Biological Productivity of Ob Forests, , Nauka, Novosibirsk, 171 pp. (In Russian); Gorbatenko, V.M., (1970) Biological Productivity of the Pine Phytocoenoses Related to Climatic Conditions in their Growth Regions, , Abstract of Dissertation, Institute of Forest and Wood, Siberian Branch, USSR Academy of Sciences, Krasnoyarsk, 28 pp. (In Russian); Gorbatenko, V.M., The impact of general climatic parameters on the primary biological productivity of pine phytocoenosis (1975) Hydrological Research in Siberian Forests, pp. 212-220. , Institute of Forest and Wood, Siberian Branch, USSR Academy of Sciences, Krasnoyarsk, In Russian; Houghton, J.T., Jenkins, G.J., Ephraums, J.J., (1990) Climate Change: The IPCC Scientific Assessment, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 365 pp; Isachenko, A.G., Shlyapnikov, A.A., Robozertseva, O.D., Filipetskaya, A.Z., (1988) The Landscape Map of the USSR, , GUGK of the USSR, Moscow.
