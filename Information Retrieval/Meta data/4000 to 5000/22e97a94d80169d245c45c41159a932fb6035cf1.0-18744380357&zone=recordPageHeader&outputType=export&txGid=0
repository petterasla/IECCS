Emission rates of N2O-N, N2-N and CH4-C from both CWs varied significantly on a both spatial and temporal scale, ranging from 1 to 2,600, 170 to 130,000, and -1.7 to 87,200 μg m-2 h-1 respectively. The average flux of N 2O from the microsites in the Kodijärve horizontal subsurface flow (HSSF) CW and Kõo hybrid CW ranged from 27 to 370 and from 72 to 500 μg N2O-N m-2 h-1, respectively, whereas the average dinitrogen flux from the microsites in the HSSF CW in Kodijärve was 2-3 magnitudes higher than the N2O flux, ranging from 19,500 to 33,300 μg N2-N m-2 h-1. The average methane emissions from the microsites in the Kodijärve HSSF CW and the Kõo hybrid CW ranged from 31 to 12,100 and from 950 to 5,750 μg CH4-C m-2 h-1, respectively. The highest emission values for all three gases were observed in the warm period. There was a significant relationship between emission rates and water table depth: CH4 and N2 emission increased and N2O emission decreased when the water table did rise. Although the emission of N2O and CH4 from CWs was found to be relatively high, their global warming potential (GWP) in the time horizon of 100 years is not significant, ranging from 4.5 to 16.3 tonnes of CO2 equivalents per ha per year in Kodijärve and from 12.1 to 17.3 t CO2 equivalents ha-1 yr-1 in Kõo.
