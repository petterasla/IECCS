This coincides with increasing concerns over the use of fossil fuel derived energy sources and their potential to enhance the Earth's greenhouse effect and promote global climate change, creating a serious paradox for those responsible for managing the aquatic environment. However, previous research also suggests that novel technologies and practices could potentially mitigate the problem in hand. This paper describes the development of a model for estimating future energy use and CO2 emissions in the wastewater treatment sector, and outlines the results of different projections using incumbent and novel practices. Indications are that using incumbent approaches could augment CO2 emissions by 15-30% in the medium- to long-term, while loss of the agricultural sludge route and deployment of an incineration strategy could mean increases are of the order of 50-70%. Alternatively, the construction of a greater number of sludge treatment facilities, with greater biogas recovery, could reduce this burden to around -8 to +7% over the same period, while the realisation of the full potential an anaerobic pre-treatment process could lead to reductions of up to 16%. Nevertheless, some of the options will come at a higher cost then incumbents, and the potential for making the business case for these investments is explored.","CO2 emissions; Energy use; Investment strategy; Process modelling; Water quality","biogas; carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; surface water; alternative energy; sustainability; wastewater treatment; water industry; water quality; alternative energy; sustainability; water industry; water quality; water treatment; agricultural parameters; aquatic environment; article; biosolid; climate change; commercial phenomena; controlled study; energy; energy resource; evaluation; global climate; greenhouse effect; process model; quality control; sludge treatment; United Kingdom; waste water management; water quality; agriculture; construction work and architectural phenomena; cost; economics; environmental protection; Europe; methodology; sewage; theoretical model; water supply; Agriculture; Carbon Dioxide; Conservation of Natural Resources; Costs and Cost Analysis; Energy-Generating Resources; Europe; Facility Design and Construction; Greenhouse Effect; Models, Theoretical; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Water Supply",,"Carbon Dioxide, 124-38-9",,,,"Zakkour, P.D., Gaterell, M.R., Griffin, P., Gochin, R.J., Lester, J.N., Developing a sustainable energy strategy for a water utility Part I: A review of the UK legislative framework (2002) J.
