This is the balance between the shortwave energy absorbed by the earth, which is represented by a spatially and temporally averaged absorbed flux F{downwards arrow to bar}, and theemitted longwave energy, which is represented by the corresponding averaged emitted flux F{upwards arrow to bar}. The TOA average net flux FN is dened as the difference between the two over the averaged area and time, which may be a local, regional, or global average. A global nonzero net flux represents a measure of imbalance between the energy being absorbed and emitted by the earth for the time interval in question. It is of interest to ask what the natural variability of the net flux might be and whether, during times of climate change, signals of important climate change processes might be detected against this natural background variation; examples of these signals include evidence of ocean heat storage, the effects of El Niňo, and the radiative effects of volcanic eruptions. In this paper, the authors review the signicance of the net flux, survey the observational evidence from a range of satellite instruments over several decades, and analyze some of the most recent observations from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) program to determine what signals and what natural variability might be expected in the TOA net flux. Based on this analysis, the use of broadband radiation measurements for global climate change studies can be assessed. © 2010 American Meteorological Society.",,"Broadband radiation; Clouds and the Earth's radiant energy systems; Global climate changes; Long waves; Model study; Natural backgrounds; Natural variability; Non equilibrium; Ocean heat; Radiative effects; Radiative energy balance; Satellite instruments; Time interval; Top of atmospheres; Volcanic eruptions; Earth atmosphere; Energy balance; Heat storage; Nickel compounds; Oceanography; Volcanoes; Climate change; climate change; climate variation; Earth; El Nino; energy balance; longwave radiation; radiative forcing; satellite imagery; shortwave radiation",,,,,,"Andrews, D.G., (2000) An Introduction to Atmospheric Physics, p. 229. , Cambridge University Press; Barkstrom, B., The Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) (1984) Bull.
