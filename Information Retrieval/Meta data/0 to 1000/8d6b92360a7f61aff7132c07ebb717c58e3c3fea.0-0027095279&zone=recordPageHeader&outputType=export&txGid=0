The results show that both annual mean sea-surface temperature and the size of the warm pool increased from 1983 to 1987 and fluctuated after 1987. Possible causes of these variations include solar irradiance variabilities, El Niño-Southern Oscillation events, volcanic activities, and global warming.",,"1982-1991; SST; Western Pacific Warm Pool; Pacific, (Western)",,,,,,,"Yan, X.-H.; Center for Remote Sensing, Graduate College of Marine Studies, University of Delaware, Newark, DE 19716, United States",,,,,,,,00368075,,SCIEA,,"English","Science",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027095279
