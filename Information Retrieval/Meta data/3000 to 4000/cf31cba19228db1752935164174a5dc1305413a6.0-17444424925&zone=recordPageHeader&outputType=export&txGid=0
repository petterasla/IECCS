In order to prevent rapid climate change, it will be necessary to stabilize CO2 as carbonate by the carbonation process. Carbonation of the widely occurring mineral olivine (Mg2SiO4) converts CO2 into an environmentally benign mineral magnesite (MgCO 3). The availability of a CO2 fixation technology would serve as insurance in case global warming causes severe restrictions on CO 2 emissions. The yield of carbonation increased with increasing temperature. The rate of carbonation conversion sharply increased in initial 20 min and then reduced and reached a plateau value after about 40 min. The carbonation conversion with MgO is higher than that of CaO.",,"Calcium compounds; Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Magnesite; Calcium silicate; Fossil-fuel-fired power plants; Monolithic materials; Stir rate; Flue gases",,,,,,"Bearat, H., McKelvy, M., Chizmeshya, A., Nunez, R., Carpenter, R., Investigation of the mechanisms that govern carbon dioxide sequestration via aqueous olivine mineral carbonation (2003) Proceedings of the International Technical Conference on Coal Utilization and Fuel System, 1, p. 307; Chriswell, C., Gollakota, S., Adsorption of sulfur dioxide from combustion gases on a regenerable molecular sieve (1987) Amer.
