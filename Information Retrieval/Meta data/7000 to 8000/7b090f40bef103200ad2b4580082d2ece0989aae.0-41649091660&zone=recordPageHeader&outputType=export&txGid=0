Despite their attraction for mushroom pickers and their economic importance, little is known about the phenology of fruiting bodies. Using ≈34,500 dated herbarium records we analyzed changes in the autumnal fruiting date of mushrooms in Norway over the period 1940-2006. We show that the time of fruiting has changed considerably over this time period, with an average delay in fruiting since 1980 of 12.9 days. The changes differ strongly between species and groups of species. Early-fruiting species have experienced a stronger delay than late fruiters, resulting in a more compressed fruiting season. There is also a geographic trend of earlier fruiting in the northern and more continental parts of Norway than in more southern and oceanic parts. Incorporating monthly precipitation and temperature variables into the analyses provides indications that increasing temperatures during autumn and winter months bring about significant delay of fruiting both in the same year and in the subsequent year. The recent changes in autumnal mushroom phenology coincide with the extension of the growing season caused by global climate change and are likely to continue under the current climate change scenario. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Agarics; Fungi; Global warming; Herbarium data; Phenology","article; autumn; climate change; fruiting; fruiting body; greenhouse effect; growing season; mushroom; nonhuman; Norway; phenology; precipitation; priority journal; temperature sensitivity; winter; Agaricales; climate; geography; physiology; season; time; Basidiomycota; Fungi; Agaricales; Climate; Fruiting Bodies, Fungal; Geography; Norway; Seasons; Time Factors",,,,,,"Menzel, A., Sparks, T.H., Estrella, N., Koch, E., Aasa, A., Ahas, R., Alm-Kübler, K., Briede, A., (2006) Glob Change Biol, 12, pp. 1969-1976; Stenseth, N.C., Mysterud, A., Ottersen, G., Hurrell, J.W., Chan, K.S., Lima, M., (2002) Science, 297, pp. 1292-1296; Walther, G.R., Post, E., Convey, P., Menzel, A., Parmesan, C., Beebee, T.J.C., Fromentin, J.M., Bairlein, F., (2002) Nature, 416, pp. 389-395; Menzel, A., Fabian, P., (1999) Nature, 397, p. 659; Bradley, N.L., Leopold, A.C., Ross, J., Wellington, H., (1999) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 96, pp. 9701-9704; Fitter, A.H., Fitter, R.S.R., (2002) Science, 296, pp. 1689-1691; Lavoie, C., Lachance, D., (2006) Am J Bot, 93, pp. 512-516; Primack, D., Imbres, C., Primack, R.B., Miller-Rushing, A.J., Del Tredici, P., (2004) Am J Bot, 91, pp. 1260-1264; Jonzén, N., Lindén, A., Ergon, T., Knudsen, E., Vik, J.O., Rubolini, D., Piacentini, D., Karlsson, L., (2006) Science, 312, pp. 1959-1961; Gange, A.C., Gange, E.G., Sparks, T.H., Boddy, L., (2007) Science, 316, p. 71; Wood, S.N., (2006) Generalized Additive Models: An Introduction with R, , Chapman and Hall/CRC, Boca Raton, FL; Post, E., Stenseth, N.C., (1999) Ecology, 80, pp. 1322-1339; Kües, U., Liu, Y., (2000) Appl Microbiol Biotechnol, 54, pp. 141-152; Ovaska, J.A., Nilsen, J., Wielgolaski, F.E., Kauhanen, H., Partanen, R., Neuvonen, S., Kapari, L., Laine, K., (2005) Ecol Stud, 180, pp. 99-115; Eveling, D.W., Wilson, R.N., Gillespie, E.S., Bataille, A., (1990) Mycol Res, 94, pp. 998-1002; (2007) Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability.
