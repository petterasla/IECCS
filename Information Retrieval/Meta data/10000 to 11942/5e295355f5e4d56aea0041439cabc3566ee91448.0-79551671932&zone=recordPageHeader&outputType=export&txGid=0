This research, integrated into the European Clean Sky project, addresses the optimization of commercial aircraft departure procedures in order to minimize their environmental footprint. The environmental impact is defined by noise nuisance in the protected zones near airports, local air quality, and global warming. A recent, innovating method is proposed to solve the problem of a real-world aircraft departing from an ideal airport. A multi-objective, constrained, nonlinear optimization problem is formulated to obtain optimal departure procedures. The promising results obtained by the application of this methodology to a theoretical but representative scenario strongly encourage research activities in this direction.
