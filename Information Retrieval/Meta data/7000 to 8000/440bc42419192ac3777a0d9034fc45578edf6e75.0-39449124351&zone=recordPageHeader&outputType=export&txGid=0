PSI is looking at eight indicators reflecting environmental (life-cycle Global Warming Potential (GWP), life-cycle air quality potential, sustainable materials, restricted substances and drive by exterior noise), social (mobility capability and safety) and economic (life-cycle cost of ownership) vehicle attributes. Ford Galaxy and S-MAX are the first vehicles where this tool has been applied from the beginning of their development. The results show significant improvements compared to the predecessor. This has been externally reviewed according to ISO 14040.
