This index is then applied to results of a simulation of the effects of global warming on the productivity of cow-calf range livestock systems in the western USA. Estimates of declining range-based incomes in a southern tier of states coupled with increasing productivity in the middle and northern Great Plains, the inter-mountain Rockies and the Pacific Northwest suggest that significant shifts could occur in the location of feeder calf production if these climate changes occur. © 1995.",,"climatic change; global warming; income effect; livestock production; productivity impact; range income; USA, (Northwest); USA, Great Plains; USA, Rocky Mountains",,,,,,"Alley, Sheftes, External effects of pumping decisions: High Plains aquifer (1987) Water Resources Research, 23, pp. 1123-1130; Baker, A national analysis of the potential effects of climate change on rangeland ecosystems (1991) PhD dissertation, , Department of Animal Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO; Baker, Bourdon, Hanson, FORAGE: a simulation model on grazing behavior for beef cattle (1992) Ecological Modelling, 60, pp. 257-279; Baker, Hanson, Bourdon, Eckert, The potential effects of climate change on ecosystem processes and cattle production on US rangelands (1993) Climatic Change, 25, pp. 97-117; Bartlett, Taylor, McKean, (1979) Impacts of federal grazing on the economy of Colorado, , Department of Range Science, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, Unpublished report; Bourdon, Simulated effects of genotype and management on beef production efficiency (1983) PhD dissertation, , Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO; Field, Simulation of beef-heifer production on rangeland (1987) MS thesis, , Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO; Gutierrez, Sharp, Schaubert, Dalsted, Hansen, Selected livestock enterprise budgets for Colorado, 1986 (1987) Information report IR:87-3, , Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO; Hansen, Russell, Rind, Stone, Lacis, Lebedeff, Ruedy, Travis, Efficient three-dimensional global models for climate studies: Models I and II (1983) Monthly Weather Review, 3, pp. 609-662; Hanson, Baker, Bourdon, SPUR2 documentation and users guide (1992) US Department of Agriculture, Great Plains Systems Research, technical report-1, , Fort Collins, CO; Hanson, Baker, Bourdon, Comparison of the effects of different climate change scenarios on range livestock production (1993) Agric.
