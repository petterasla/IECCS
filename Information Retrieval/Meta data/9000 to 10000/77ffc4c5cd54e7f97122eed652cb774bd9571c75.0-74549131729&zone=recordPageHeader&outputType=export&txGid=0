The Black Sea is the world's most isolated sea. Methane exists as gas hydrates or methane clathrate form in the Black Sea. Gas hydrates potential in the Black Sea is investigated as a source of methane. Methane gas hydrate is a solid combination of methane and ice. It is found under continental shelves and on land under permafrost and can contain from 80-99.9% of methane. Gas hydrate is found in sub-oceanic sediments and in continental slope sediments, where pressure and temperature conditions combine to make it stable. Natural gas hydrate contains highly concentrated methane, which is important both as an energy resource and as a factor in global climate change. The difficulty with recovering this source of energy is that the fuel is in solid form and is not amenable to conventional gas and oil recovery techniques.","Black Sea; Clathrates; Gas hydrate; Methane","Black sea; Clathrates; Continental shelves; Continental slope; Crystalline solids; Global climate changes; Methane gas; Oceanic sediments; Oil recoveries; Pressure and temperature; Solid forms; Source of energy; Butane; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Energy resources; Ethane; Gases; Hydration; Liquefied petroleum gas; Methane; Natural gas; Natural gas deposits; Propane; Sedimentology; Sediments; Gas hydrates",,,,,,"Ahmadi, G., Ji, C., Smith, D.H., Production of natural gas from methane hydrate by a constant downhole pressure well (2007) Energy Convers.
