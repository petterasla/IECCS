Our method was to use zeolite as adsorbent for physical adsorption, progressing from the previously used PSA (Pressure Swing Adsorption) method to the more advanced PTSA (Pressure and Temperature Swing Adsorption) method. We have been conducting basic research since the 1980s, and in 1991 built a 1000m3N/h scale pilot plant, where we are continuing research through trial operation. Trial operation of the pilot plant has been mainly for acquisition of scale up data, as well as improvement in the decrease in the power consumption of PTSA units. As a result, we have seen a better than 20% improvement in that area. In addition, the pilot plant completed 2000 hours of continuous operation without incident between October and December, 1994. The total hours of operation of the plant have topped 4000 hours, but we have seen no decrease in the effectiveness of the CO2 adsorbent. The SOx in the flue gas was trapped in the lower part of desiccant in PSA-H2O before the process. Some of desiccant reacts to that, but we have prevented any ill effects on the process that might be caused by main units. At this point we would like to report on the results of our research, as well as outline our plants for the future.",,,,,,,,"Nishikawa, N., (1993) Proceeding of 26th Annual Meeting of SCEJ, pp. Q103; Nishikawa, N., Ishibashi, M., Ohta, H., Yasutake, A., Nohara, H., Nawata, H., (1993) Proceeding of 26th Annual Meeting of SCEJ, pp. Q108; Ishibashi, M., Ohta, H., Akatsu, N., Umeda, S., Mori, A., Oda, N., Yamada, M., Kageyama, Y., (1995) Proceeding of CSPE-JSME-ASME ICOPE-95, p. 990; Nishikawa, N., Ishibashi, M., Ohta, H., Izu Mi, J., Yasutake, A., Nohara, H., Kageyama, Y., (1994) Proceeding of 27th Annual Meeting of SCEJ, pp. K314",,,,,,,,,01968904,,ECMAD,,"English","Energy Convers.
