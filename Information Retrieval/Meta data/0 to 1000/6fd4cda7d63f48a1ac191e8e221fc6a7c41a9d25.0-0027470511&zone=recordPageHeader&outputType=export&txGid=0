The 14 models in the study are heterogeneous, which has a number of advantages. Chief among these is the greater number of insights obtainable by comparing the models' results in and across global warming policy scenarios. To fully appreciate the results, however, it is necessary to understand how a model's structure affects its output. The disadvantage of a diverse set of models is that it complicates structure comparison, and thereby the interpretation of results. The relevant model characteristics fall into three broad areas of comparison. The first is the model type, including market representation. Despite the many differences among the models, five distinct classes of market representations are seen within which models have great similarity. This simplifies understanding the remaining areas of comparison: energy demand and supply modelling. The foci here are the representation of capital stock dynamics and market penetration of carbon free energy sources respectively. © 1993.","CO2 emissions; Energy models; Model comparisons","comparative studies; Energy Modeling Forum; market representation; modelling approach; structural comparison",,,,,,,"Beaver, R.; Energy Modeling Forum, Stanford University, Strategic Decisions Group, 2440 Sand Hill Road, Menlo Park, CA 94025, United States",,,,,,,,03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027470511
