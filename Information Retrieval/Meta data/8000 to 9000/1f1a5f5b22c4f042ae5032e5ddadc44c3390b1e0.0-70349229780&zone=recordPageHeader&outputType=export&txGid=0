A study was undertaken to calculate (1) global warming mitigation potential (GMP) and thereby earning carbon credit of a family size biogas plant in India, (2) GMP of the existing and target biogas plants in the country and (3) atmospheric pollution reduction by a family size biogas plant. The GMP of a family size biogas plant was 9.7 t CO2 equiv. year-1 and with the current price of US $10 t-1 CO2 equiv., carbon credit of US $97 year-1 could be earned from such reduction in greenhouse gas emission under the clean development mechanism (CDM). A family size biogas plant substitutes 316 L of kerosene, 5,535 kg firewood and 4,400 kg cattle dung cake as fuels which will reduce emissions of NOx, SO2, CO and volatile organic compounds to the atmosphere by 16.4, 11.3, 987.0 and 69.7 kg year-1, respectively. Presently 3.83 million biogas plants are operating in the country, which can mitigate global warming by 37 Mt CO2 equiv. year-1. Government of India has a target of installing 12.34 million biogas plants by 2010. This target has a GMP of 120 Mt CO2 equiv. year-1 and US $1,197 million as carbon credit under the CDM. However, if all the collectible cattle dung (225 Mt) produced in the country is used, 51.2 million family size biogas plants can be supported which will have a GMP of 496 Mt of CO2 equiv. year-1 and can earn US $4,968 million as carbon credit. The reduction in global warming should encourage policy makers to promote biogas technology to combat climate change and integration of carbon revenues will help the farmers to develop biogas as a profitable activity. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.","Atmospheric pollution; Biogas plant; Carbon trading; Cattle dung; Firewood; Global warming mitigation potential; Greenhouse gas; India","Atmospheric pollution; Biogas plant; Carbon trading; Cattle dung; Firewood; India; Air pollution; Atmospheric chemistry; Aviation; Continuum damage mechanics; Emission control; Fertilizers; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Kerosene; Leakage (fluid); Manures; Profitability; Targets; Volatile organic compounds; Biogas; biogas; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; kerosene; nitrogen oxide; sulfur dioxide; volatile organic compound; atmospheric pollution; biogas; clean development mechanism; emission control; emissions trading; environmental economics; global warming; greenhouse gas; pollution policy; trade-environment relations; volatile organic compound; air pollution control; article; biofuel production; climate change; controlled study; cost; environmental economics; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; India; manure; policy; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Atmosphere; Carbon; Environmental Remediation; Greenhouse Effect; India; Manure; Power Plants; Asia; Eurasia; India; South Asia; Bos",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; carbon monoxide, 630-08-0; kerosene, 8008-20-6; nitrogen oxide, 11104-93-1; sulfur dioxide, 7446-09-5; Air Pollutants; Carbon, 7440-44-0; Manure",,,,"Ball, J., Cows, climate change and carbon credits (2007) The Wall Street Journal-Online, B1. , (June 14, 2007); Bhatia, A., Pathak, H., Aggarwal, P.K., Inventory of methane and nitrous oxide emissions from agricultural soils of India and their global warming potential (2004) Current Science, 87 (3), pp. 317-324; Chawla, O.P., Use of other inputs (1986) Advances in Biogas Technology, p. 77. , In New Delhi: Indian Council of Agricultural Research; (2006) Waste Generation and Composition Report, , CPCB.
