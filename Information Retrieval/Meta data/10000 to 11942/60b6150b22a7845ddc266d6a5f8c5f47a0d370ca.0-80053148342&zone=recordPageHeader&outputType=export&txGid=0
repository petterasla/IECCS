Using the best available observations over China, the decadal variability and recent trends in summer rainfall are investigated with the emphasis on changes in the seasonal evolution and on the temporal characteristics of daily rainfall. The possible relationships with global warming are reassessed. Substantial decadal variability in summer rainfall has been confirmed during the period 1958-2008; this is not unique to this period but is also seen in the earlier decades of the twentieth century. Two dominant patterns of decadal variability have been identified that contribute substantially to the recent trend of southern flooding and northern drought. Natural decadal variability appears to dominate in general but in the cases of rainfall intensity and the frequency of rainfall days, particularly light rain days, then the dominant EOFs have a rather different character, being of one sign over most of China, and having principal components (PCs) that appear more trendlike. The increasing intensity of rainfall throughout China and the decrease in light rainfall days, particularly in the north, could at least partially be of anthropogenic origin, both global and regional, linked to increased greenhouse gases and increased aerosols. © 2011 American Meteorological Society.","Aerosols; Anthropogenic effects; Asia; Decadal variability; Rainfall; Trends","Anthropogenic climate changes; Anthropogenic effects; Anthropogenic origin; Asia; Daily rainfall; Decadal variability; Internal variability; Principal Components; Rain days; Rainfall intensity; Recent trends; Summer rainfall; Temporal characteristics; Time-scales; Trends; Twentieth century; Aerosols; Atmospheric aerosols; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Rain; aerosol; anthropogenic effect; climate change; decadal variation; precipitation intensity; principal component analysis; rainfall; seasonal variation; twentieth century; China",,,,,,"Allen, M., Ingram, W., Constraints on future changes in climate and the hydrologic cycle (2002) Nature, 429, pp. 224-232; Chang, C., Zhang, Y., Li, T., Interannual and interdecadal variations of the East Asian summer monsoon and the tropical Pacific SSTs.
