The vast majority of existing materials are based on non-renewable fossil resources that will eventually be extinguished. Manufacturing synthetic polymers and disposal by incineration produces CO2 and contributes to global warming. For these reasons, poly(lactic acid) (PLA) polymers are of increasing commercial interest because they are derived from a renewable resources, sequester significant quantities of carbon dioxide relative to petrochemical based materials, conserve energy, and easily degrade. The mechanical properties of PLA are compared to other commodity plastics and it is shown that PLA closely resembles polystyrene. The effects of blending linear and branched chain architectures are discussed and it is shown that this provides a convenient method for controlling the elasticity and viscosity of the composite material without affecting mechanical or permeation properties. The melt rheology of high L content linear PLAs shows two unique features; they may be drawn to large Hencky strains without breaking and they exhibit considerable strain hardening. As a result, PLA is easily processed into fiber form. Due to the excellent combination of mechanical, rheological, and environmental properties, the prospects for widespread commercialization of PLA are excellent. © WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH.",,"Chain architecture; Commodity plastics; Conserve energy; Economic concerns; Environmental property; Environmentally benign; Fossil resources; Melt rheology; Non-renewable; Permeation properties; Petrochemical-based materials; Polylactic acids; Polylactides; Renewable resource; Synthetic macromolecules; Synthetic polymers; Unique features; Blending; Carbon dioxide; Composite micromechanics; Elasticity; Energy conservation; Global warming; Incineration; Lactic acid; Mechanical properties; Organic acids; Plasticity; Polymer blends; Polystyrenes; Rheology; Strain; Strain hardening; Supramolecular chemistry; Viscosity; Renewable energy resources",,,,,,"(2000) Chemical and Engineering News, pp. 48-71. , June 26; Datta, R., Tsai, S., Bonsignore, P., Moon, S., Frank, J.R., (1995) FEMS Microbiology Reviews, 16, pp. 221-231; Dorgan, J.R., Poly(lactic acid) properties and prospects of an environmentally benign plastic (1999) 3rd Annual Green Chemistry and Engineering Conference Proceedings, pp. 145-149. , (Washington, D.C.); Hartman, M.H., High molecular weight polylactic acid polymers (1998) Biopolymers from Renewable Resources, pp. 367-411. , D.
