""Safe yield"" should yield to broader concepts such as ""sustainability"". Groundwater management needs to consider future needs of the people and all ecosystems in accordance with basin development models. Groundwater law needs to be expanded beyond quantity to address quality concerns. A new institutional framework should be established and groundwater regulation should reflect new approaches and ideas, in particular to address problems of application. © 2011 International Water Resources Association.","Application; Concepts; Groundwater law; Licence; Sustainability; Turkey",,,,,,,"Alley, W.M., Leake, S.A., The journey from safe yield to sustainability (2004) Ground Water, 42 (1), pp. 12-16; Apaydin, A., Man made threats on aquifers and some problems caused by regulations and applications in Turkey (2009) Proceedings of 62nd Geological Congress of Turkey, , In, Ankara, Turkey; Baltasa, E.A., Dervosb, N.A., Mimikouc, M.A., Hydrological response and examination of the water resources in an experimental watershed in Greece (2010) Water International, 35 (3), pp. 324-335; Banks, H., Utilization of underground storage reservoirs (1953) Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers, 118, pp. 220-234; Baris, M.E., Karadag, A.A., Water resources management issues in Turkey and recommendations (2007) Journal of Applied Sciences, 7 (24), pp. 3900-3908; Conkling, H., Utilization of ground-water storage in stream system development (1946) Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers, 3, pp. 275-305; (2001) Water basins and their utilization and management, 8th Five Year Development Plan (2001-2005), , DPT, Ankara: Prime Minister's Press; (2006) Rural development in the European Union, statistical and economic information report, , http://ec.europa.eu/research/fp6/index_en.cfm, European Union, Available from; (2001) Gateway to land and water information Turkey, , Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), Rome: FAO; Henriksen, H.J., Assessment of exploitable groundwater resources of Denmark by use of ensemble resource indicators and a numerical groundwater-surface model (2008) Journal of Hydrology, 348, pp. 224-240; Lee, C.H., The determination of safe yield of underground reservoirs of the closed basin type (1915) Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers, 78, pp. 148-251; Loucks, P., Sustainable water resources management (2000) Water International, 25 (1), pp. 3-10; Meinzer, O.E., (1923) Outline of groundwater hydrology with definitions, , Water-Supply Paper No. 494.
