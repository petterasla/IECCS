Indeed, acid rain, massive changes in land-use, and the prospect of global climate change are giving the study of ecosystems a new meaning and new mandates. Careful natural history descriptions are no longer sufficient for evaluating potential impacts of changing environmental conditions. Understanding how ecosystems work has become a priority. The present paper investigates the role of water stress as an agent of rapid vegetation change. A sensitivity study is performed to explore the issue. Environmental changes are imposed, rather than obtained from atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) output, to facilitate the interpretation of the results, to enable the identification of generic patterns, in particular, critical thresholds, and to foster the understanding of underlying processes. A physically- and physiologically- based, climatically-sensitive, numerical simulation model of forest dynamics, the Energy, Water, and Momentum Exchange and -Ecological Dynamics (EXE) model, is used for this purpose. The results of the sensitivity analysis undertaken with EXE document the interplay between physical and physiological feedbacks and ecological forest responses to climatic changes. Moreover, they explain the relative importance of temperature, water, and nitrogen limitations, indicating that water stress is responsible for some of the fastest vegetation changes.",,"climate change; climatic change; EXE model; forest dynamics; forest response; GCM; sensitivity study; vegetation change; water stress",,,,,,"Bonan, G.B., Do Biophysics and Physiology Matter in Ecosystem Models?
