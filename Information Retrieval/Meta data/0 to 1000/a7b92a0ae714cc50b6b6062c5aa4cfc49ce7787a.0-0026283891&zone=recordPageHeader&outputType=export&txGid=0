They indicate that most of the warming which has occurred in these regions over the past four decades can be attributed to an increase of mean minimum (mostly nighttime) temperatures. Mean maximum (mostly daytime) temperatures display little or no warming. In the USA and the USSR (no access to data in China) similar characteristics are also reflected in the changes of extreme seasonal temperatures, e.g., increase of extreme minimum temperatures and little or no change in extreme maximum temperatures. -from Authors",,"diurnal temperature; global warming; temperature change; temperature minimum; thermometric record",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00948276,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026283891
