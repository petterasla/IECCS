Findings show that agriculture was the main economic sector with an employment of 95% of total population with a share of 78% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1971. After the first few years of independence, education policy was concentrated for the development of agriculture education from secondary to tertiary level because government considered agriculture as potential to economy. Currently, 75% of the populations' professions are agriculture industry and contribution towards GDP is only 22%. While the decline of employment is not notably dropped, contribution towards GDP shared by agriculture sector is dramatically descended. The article examined the probable underpinning reasons causing agriculture as a less productive industry. With many reasons, it is noted that education system is not currently supporting the development of agriculture industry. With narrations, this article proposes a policy change towards agriculture education aiming an improvement of agriculture economics of the country which ultimately will bring national development. © 2009 Academic Journals.","Agriculture economics; Agriculture education; Education and development; GDP sharing; National development",,,,,,,"Abramovitz, M., Catching up, forging ahead, and falling behind (1986) J.
