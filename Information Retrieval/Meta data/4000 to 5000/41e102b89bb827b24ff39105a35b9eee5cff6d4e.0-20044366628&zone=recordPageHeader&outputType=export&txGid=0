Amazonian deforestation rates have trended upward since 1991, with clearing proceeding at a variable but rapid pace. Although Amazonian forests are cut for various reasons, cattle ranching predominates. The large and medium-sized ranches account for about 70% of clearing activity. Profit from beef cattle is only one of the income sources that make deforestation profitable. Forest degradation results from logging, ground fires (facilitated by logging), and the effects of fragmentation and edge formation. Degradation contributes to forest loss. The impacts of deforestation include loss of biodiversity, reduced water cycling (and rainfall), and contributions to global warming. Strategies to slow deforestation include repression through licensing procedures, monitoring, and fines. The severity of penalties for deforestation needs to be sufficient to deter illegal clearing but not so great as to be unenforceable. Policy reform is also needed to address root causes of deforestation, including the role of clearing in establishing land claims.",,"deforestation; ecological impact; habitat fragmentation; habitat loss; rainforest; ranching; road construction; timber harvesting; Amazonia; Brazil; South America; Western Hemisphere; World; Bos taurus",,,,,,"Alencar, A., Nepstad, D.C., McGrath, D., Moutinho, P., Pacheco, P., Diaz, M.D.C.V., Soares-Filho, B., (2004) Desmatamento Na Amazônia: Indo Além Da Emergência Crônica, , Instituto de Pesquisa Ambiental da Amazônia, Belém, Brasil (in Portuguese); Barbosa, R.I., Fearnside, P.M., Incêndios na Amazônia brasileira: Estimativa da emissão de gases do efeito estufa pela queima de diferentes ecossistemas de Roraima na passagem do evento ""El Niño"" (1997/98) (1999) Acta Amazonica, 29, pp. 513-534. , in Portuguese; Capobianco, J.P.R., Veríssimo, A., Moreira, A., Dos Santos, I., Pinto, L.P., Sawyer, D., (2001) Biodiversidade Na Amazônia Brasileira (in Portuguese), , http://www.isa.org.br/bio/index.htm, Editora Estação Liberdade and Instituto Socioambiental, São Paulo; Cochrane, M.A., Fire science for rainforests (2003) Nature, London, 421, pp. 913-919; Cochrane, M.A., Alencar, A., Schulze, M.D., Souza Jr., C.M., Nepstad, D.C., Lefebvre, P., Davidson, E.A., Positive feedbacks in the fire dynamic of closed canopy tropical forests (1999) Science, 284, pp. 1832-1835; Faminow, M.D., (1998) Cattle, Deforestation and Development in the Amazon: An Economic and Environmental Perspective, , CAB International, New York; Fearnside, P.M., Causes of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon (1987) The Geophysiology of Amazonia: Vegetation and Climate Interactions, pp. 37-61. , R.
