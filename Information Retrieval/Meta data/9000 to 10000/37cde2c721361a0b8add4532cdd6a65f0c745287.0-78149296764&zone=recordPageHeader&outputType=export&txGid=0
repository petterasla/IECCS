Research on northern bogs in Europe and North America has found that climate change and atmospheric nitrogen deposition can shift species composition of bog communities and release carbon; however, research on southern bogs has not begun to answer questions about their fate. We reviewed research conducted in northern bogs and applied this information to southern Appalachian bogs to explore the potential impacts that climate change may have on southern Sphagnum bogs. The projected increase in evapotranspiration coupled with nitrogen deposition may lead to the drying up of southern bogs causing: (1) increased decomposition rates, which can lead to the system becoming a carbon source rather than a sink; and (2) local extinction of many bog species, allowing alternative ecosystems to replace the bogs. Because of these threats, we suggest a call to action for scientists and managers to begin investigating the specific impacts that climate change will have on bogs in the southeastern United States so we may better protect and conserve these unique and diverse habitats.","Appalachian Mountains; global warming; peatland; southeastern U.S.; West Virginia","atmospheric deposition; biodiversity; bog; carbon cycle; climate change; climate effect; evapotranspiration; habitat conservation; hot spot; nitrogen cycle; Appalachians; United States; Virginia; Sphagnum",,,,,,"Aldous, A.R., Nitrogen retention by Sphagnum mosses: Responses to atmospheric nitrogen deposition and drought (2002) Canadian Journal of Botany, 80, pp. 721-731; Alm, J., Talanov, A., Saarnio, S., Silvola, J., Ikkonen, E., Aaltonen, H., Nykanen, H., Martikainen., P.J., Reconstruction of the carbon balance for microsites in a boreal oligotrophic pine fen, Finland (1997) Oecologia, 110, pp. 423-431; Andrus, R.E., Wagner, D.J., Titus., J.E., Vertical zonation of Sphagnum mosses along hummock-hollow gradients (1983) Canadian Journal of Botany, 61, pp. 3128-3139; Belyea, L.R., Malmer., N., Carbon sequestration in peatland: Patterns and mechanisms of response to climate change (2004) Global Change Biology, 10, pp. 1043-1052; Bragazza, L., Freeman, C., Jones, T., Rydin, H., Limpense, J., Fenner, N., Ellis, T., Toberman., H., Atmospheric nitrogen deposition promotes carbon loss from peat bogs (2006) Proceedings of the National, 103, pp. 19386-19389. , Academy of Science; Brown, D.H., Bates., J.W., Bryophytes and nutrient cycling (1990) Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 104, pp. 129-147; Bubier, J., Costello, A., Moore, T.R., Roulet, N.T., Savage., K., Microtopography and methane flux in boreal peatlands, northern Ontario, Canada (1993) Canadian Journal of Botany, 71, pp. 1056-1063; Bubier, J.L., Moore, T.R., Bledzki., L.A., Effects of nutrient addition on vegetation and carbon cycling in an om-brotrophic bog (2007) Global Change Biology, 13, pp. 1168-1186; Byers, E.A., Vanderhorst, J.P., Streets., B.P., Classification and Conservation Assessment of High Elevation Wetland Communities in the Allegheny Mountains of West Virginia (2007) West Virginia Division of Natural Resources, Elkins; Cameron, C.C., (1968) Peat., pp. D153-D162. , Mineral resources of the Appalachian Region.
