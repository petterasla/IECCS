Elevated CO2 is not likely to have a major influence on probability of insect outbreak, except possibly in systems in which nitrogen-based defensive compounds are produced by plants in response to herbivory. Systems that will have a high potential to outbreak, if climatic conditions become more favourable for plant growth and responses are not constrained by other resources, include those in which both herbivorous insects and host plants have highly flexible growth patterns and activity cues. Global changes that increase environmental stress on host plants are most likely to favour sap-feeding insects. Critical enemy (predator or parasitoid) control of the dormant phase of herbivorous insects may be very important in preventing or allowing outbreaks. -Authors",,"carbon dioxide enrichment; herbivorous insect; host plant",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00671924,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027019678
