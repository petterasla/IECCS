Carbon dioxide displays exceptional persistence that renders its warming nearly irreversible for more than 1,000 y. Here we show that the warming due to non-CO2 greenhouse gases, although not irreversible, persists notably longer than the anthropogenic changes in the greenhouse gas concentrations themselves. We explore why the persistence of warming depends not just on the decay of a given greenhouse gas concentration but also on climate system behavior, particularly the timescales of heat transfer linked to the ocean. For carbon dioxide and methane, nonlinear optical absorption effects also play a smaller but significant role in prolonging the warming. In effect, dampening factors that slow temperature increase during periods of increasing concentration also slow the loss of energy from the Earth's climate system if radiative forcing is reduced. Approaches to climate change mitigation options through reduction of greenhouse gas or aerosol emissions therefore should not be expected to decrease climate change impacts as rapidly as the gas or aerosol lifetime, even for short-lived species; such actions can have their greatest effect if undertaken soon enough to avoid transfer of heat to the deep ocean.","Atmosphere; Dynamics; Radiation","carbon dioxide; methane; aerosol; article; climate change; concentration (parameters); energy absorption; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; optical depth; priority journal; quantitative analysis; temperature measurement",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; methane, 74-82-8",,,,"Forster, P., Changes in atmospheric constituents and in radiative forcing (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis, pp. 747-845. , eds S Solomon et al.
