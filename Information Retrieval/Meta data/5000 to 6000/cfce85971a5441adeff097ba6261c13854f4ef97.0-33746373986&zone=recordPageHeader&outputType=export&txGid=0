An increase in average global temperatures of approximately 0.56 K has been measured over the past century. This increase is called global climate change or global warming. The gases with three or more atoms that have higher heat capacities than those of O 2 and N2 cause the greenhouse effect. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a main greenhouse gas associated with global climate change. Nitrous oxide (N2O), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), methane (CH 4) are other important greenhouse gases. Collectively, they are projected to contribute, directly, about as much potential global warming over the next 60 years as CO2. Three trace gases, HFCs, PFCs, and SF6, would be regulated under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol because of their global warming potential and for their potential growth of concentrations in the atmosphere. HFCs have been widely approved as substitutes for CFCs.","Global climate change; Greenhouse effect; Hazardous emissions; Kyoto protocol","Approximation theory; Atoms; Carbon dioxide; Chlorofluorocarbons; Climate change; Greenhouse effect; Methane; Global climate change; Hazardous emissions; Kyoto protocol; Fossil fuels",,,,,,"Alloway, B.J., (1990) Heavy Metals in Soils, , New York: John Wiley and Sons; Brigden, K., Santillo, D., (2002) Hazardous Emissions from Philippine Coal-fired Power Plants, , Exeter, UK: Greenpeace Research Laboratories, Department of Biological Sciences, University of Exeter; Cline, W., (1992) The Economics of Global Warming, , Washington, DC: Institute for International Economics; Demirbas, A., Biomass resources for energy and chemical industry (2000) Energy Edu.
