Though wind power is considered as a very prospective energy source, wind power fluctuation due to the random fluctuation of wind speed has still created some problems. Therefore, research has been performed on how to smooth the wind power fluctuation. This paper proposes Energy Capacitor System (ECS) for the smoothing of wind power which consists of Electric Double-Layer Capacitor (EDLC) and power electronics devices and works as an electric power storage system. Moreover, hydrogen has received much attention in recent years from the viewpoint of the problem of exhaustion of fossil fuel. Therefore, it is also proposed that a hydrogen generator be installed at the wind farm to generate hydrogen. In this paper, the effectiveness of the proposed system is verified by simulation analyses using PSCAD/EMTDC. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
