However, other studies carried out in the 1990s yielded contradictory results. Many environmental factors have been hypothesized to contribute to the increasing hay fever rate, including both indoor and ambient air pollution, reduced exposure to microbial stimulation and changes in diets. However, the observed increase has not convincingly been explained by any of these factors and there is limited evidence of changes in exposure to these risk factors over time. Additionally, recent studies show that no further increase in asthma, hay fever and atopic sensitisation in adolescents and adults has been observed during the 1990s and the beginning of the new century. As the pattern of pollen counts has changed over the years, partly due to the global warming but also as a consequence of a change in the use of land, the changing prevalence of hay fever might partly be driven by this different pollen exposure. Epidemiological data for hay fever in Switzerland are available from 1926 until 2000 (with large gaps between 1926 and 1958 and 1958 to 1986) whereas pollen data are available from 1969 until the present. This allows an investigation as to whether these data are correlated provided the same time spans are compared. It would also be feasible to correlate the pollen data with meteorological data which, however, is not the subject of our investigation. Our study focuses on analyzing time series of pollen counts and of pollen season lengths in order to identify their trends, and to ascertain whether there is a relationship between these trends and the changes in the hay fever prevalence. It is shown in this paper that the pollen exposure has been decreasing in Basel since the beginning of the 1990s whereas the rate of the hay fever prevalence in Switzerland remained approximately unchanged in this period but with a slight tendency to decrease. In Locarno, most of the pollen species also show a decreasing trend, while in Zurich, the development is somewhat different as the pollen counts of most of the pollen types have been increasing. It is interesting, however, that some of the pollen counts of this station (grass, stinging nettle, mugwort and ragweed) have been decreasing in the period 1982-2007. © 2008 ISB.","Allergic rhinitis; Climate change; Pollen counts; Time-trend","air pollution; article; hay fever; human; methodology; pollen; prevalence; risk assessment; risk factor; season; statistics; Switzerland; Air Pollution; Humans; Pollen; Prevalence; Rhinitis, Allergic, Seasonal; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Seasons; Statistics as Topic; Switzerland; Ambrosia; Artemisia vulgaris; Urtica dioica",,,,,,"(2007) Arealstatistik, , www.landuse-stat.admin.ch, BfS; Bjorksten, B., Epidemiology of pollution-induced airway disease in Scandinavia and Eastern Europe (1997) Allergy, 52, pp. 23-25. , 38 Suppl; Braun-Fahrländer, C., Gassner, M., Grize, L., Takken-Sahli, K., Neu, U., Stricker, T., Varonier, H.S., Sennhauser, F.H., No further increase in asthma, hay fever and atopic sensitisation in adolescents living in Switzerland (2004) Eur Respir J, 23, pp. 407-413. , SCARPOL Team; Emberlin, J., Detandt, M., Gehrig, R., Jaeger, S., Nolard, N., Rantio- Lehtimäki, A., Responses in the start of Betula (birch) pollen seasons to recent changes in spring temperatures across Europe (2002) Int J Biometeorol, 46, pp. 159-170; Frei, T., The effects of climate change in Switzerland 1969-1996 on airborne pollen quantities from hazel, birch and grass (1998) Grana, 37, pp. 172-179; Frei, T., Gassner, E., Climate change and its impact on birch pollen quantities and the start of the pollen season an example from Switzerland for the period 1969-2006 (2008) Int J Biometeorol, , doi:10.1007/s00484-008-0159-2; Goldberg, C., Buch, H., Moseholm, L., Rung Weeke, E., Airborne pollen records in Denmark, 1977-1986 (1988) Grana, 27, pp. 209-217; Grize, L., Gassner, M., Wüthrich, B., Bringolf-Isler, B., Takken-Sahli, K., Sennhauser, F.H., Stricker, T., Braun-Fahrländer, C., Trends in prevalence of asthma, allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis in 5-7-year old Swiss children from 1992 to 2001 (2006) Allergy, 61, pp. 556-562. , SCARPOL Team; Hermann-Kunz, E., (1999) Incidence of Allergic Diseases in East and West Germany, , Gesundheitswesen.
