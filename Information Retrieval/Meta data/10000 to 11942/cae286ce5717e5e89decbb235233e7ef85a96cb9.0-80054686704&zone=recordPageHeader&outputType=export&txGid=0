We used a provenance trial in which replicated genotypes from populations varying in mean annual temperature were transplanted to a common garden adjacent to the Lower Colorado River in southeastern California. The garden environment represented an extreme maximum temperature for the study species. Four major findings emerged: (1) Genotypic variation in ANPP was significant for all species with broad-sense heritability (H 2) across populations of 0.11, 0.13, and 0.10 for P. fremontii, S. gooddingii, and S. exigua, respectively, and within-population H 2 ranging from 0.00 to 0.25, 0.00 to 0.44, and 0.02 to 0.21, respectively. (2) Population ANPP decreased linearly as mean annual maximum temperature (MAMT) transfer distance increased for both P. fremontii (r 2 = 0.64) and S. gooddingii (r 2 = 0.37), whereas it did not change for S. exigua; (3) Populations with similar MAMT to that of the common garden were 1.5 and 1.2 times more productive than populations with 5.0 °C MAMT transfer distances for P. fremontii and S. gooddingii, respectively; and (4) Variation in regression slopes among species for the relationship between ANPP and MAMT indicate species-specific responses to temperature. As these plant species characterize a threatened habitat type and support a diverse community that includes endangered species, ecosystem restoration programs should consider using both local genotypes and productive genotypes from warmer environments to maximize productivity of riparian ecosystems in the face of global climate change. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Aboveground net primary productivity; Assisted migration; Climate change; Cottonwood; Heritability; Local adaptation; Provenance; Riparian; Willow","aboveground production; endangered species; environmental restoration; genetic variation; genotype; hypothesis testing; net primary production; phreatic zone; restoration ecology; riparian vegetation; shrub; spatial distribution; temperature effect; tree; California; Colorado River [North America]; United States; Populus; Populus fremontii; Salix; Salix exigua; Salix gooddingii",,,,,,"Aitken, S.N., Yeaman, S., Holliday, J.A., Wang, T., Curtis-McLane, S., Adaptation, migration or extirpation: climate change outcomes for tree populations (2008) Evolutionary Applications, 1, pp. 95-111; Barnett, T.P., Pierce, D.W., Hidalgo, H.G., Human-induced changes in the hydrology of the western United States (2008) Science, 319, pp. 1080-1083; Bassman, J.H., Zwier, J.C., Gas exchange characteristics of Populus trichocarpa, Populus deltoides and Populus trichocarpa × P. deltoides clones (1991) Tree Physiology, 8, pp. 145-159; Berg, K.J., Samuelson, G.M., Willms, C.R., Pearce, D.W., Rood, S.B., Consistent growth of black cottonwoods despite temperature variation across Rocky Mountains ecoregions (2007) Trees, 21, pp. 161-169; Busch, D.E., Smith, S.D., Mechanisms associated with decline of woody species in riparian ecosystems of the Southwestern U.S (1995) Ecological Monographs, 65, pp. 347-370; Carter, K.K., Provenance tests as indicators of growth response to climate change in 10 north temperate tree species (1996) Canadian Journal of Forest Research, 26, pp. 1089-1095; Conner, J.K., Hartl, D.L., (2004) A Primer of Ecological Genetics, , Sinauer, Sunderland; Coops, N.C., Waring, R.H., Assessing forest growth across southwestern Oregon under a range of current and future global change scenarios using a process model, 3-PG (2001) Global Change Biology, 7, pp. 15-29; Cox, G., Fischer, D.G., Hart, S.C., Whitham, T.G., Nonresponse of native cottonwood trees to water additions during summer drought (2005) Western North American Naturalist, 65, pp. 175-185; Crespi, B.J., The evolution of maladaptation (2000) Heredity, 84, p. 623; Davis, M.B., Shaw, R.G., Range shifts and adaptive responses to quaternary climate change (2001) Science, 292, pp. 673-679; Dawson, T.E., Ehleringer, J.R., Streamside trees that do not use stream water (1991) Nature, 350, pp. 335-337; Durka, W., Genetic diversity in peripheral and subcentral populations of Corrigiola litoralis L.
