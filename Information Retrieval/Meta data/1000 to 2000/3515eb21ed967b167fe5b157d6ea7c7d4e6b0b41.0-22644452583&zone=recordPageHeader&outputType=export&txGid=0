In the semiconductor industry, PFC are used to periodically remove deposits from the chamber walls of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) reactors after film deposition. These chamber clean processes account for typically 50%-70% of the PFC usage in a semiconductor wafer fabrication site, the rest being mainly used for wafer-etching processes. With a conventional parallel plate radio frequency (rf) plasma reactor, the PFC gas utilization is incomplete and a large fraction of unreacted gas can be emitted in the atmosphere. This paper describes a microwave plasma source that provides as high as 99.9% utilization removal efficiency (URE) of the reactant gas (NF3) during chamber clean. This technology brings the million metric tons carbon equivalent (MMTCE) of a chamber clean to negligible levels and also enhances the chamber clean efficiency and the system throughput. Here we review the requirements for the manufacturability of a remote plasma clean process. Gaseous Fourier transform infrared and quadrupole mass spectroscopy techniques have been used to characterize the clean process, the by-products of the reaction, and the efficiency in reducing the MMTCE of CVD chamber cleans. © 1999 American Vacuum Society.",,,,,,,,"Wuebbles, D., (1998) Proceedings of the Global Semiconductor Industry Conference on Perfluorocompound Emission Control, , Monterey, CA, 7-8 April; Dutrow, E.A., USEPA's voluntary greenhouse gas emission reduction initiative: A focus on the microelectronics industry (1995) Proceedings of the SEMI PFC Technical Update, , July; Maroulis, P., Langan, J., Johnson, A., Ridgeway, R., Withers, H., (1994) Semic.
