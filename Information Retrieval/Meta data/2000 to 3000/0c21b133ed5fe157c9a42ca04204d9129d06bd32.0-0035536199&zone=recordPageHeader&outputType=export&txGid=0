PFCs have significant effects on the global warming and have very long atmospheric lifetimes. Laboratory-scale experiments were performed to evaluate the effectiveness of CF4 conversion by using dielectric barrier discharges (DBD). The results of this study revealed that the removal efficiency of CF4 increased with application of higher voltage, gas residence time, oxygen content, and frequency. Combined plasma catalysis (CPC ) is an innovative way for abatement of PFC and experimental results indicated that combining plasma with catalysts could effectively remove CF4. Products were analyzed by Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and the major products of the CF4 processing with DBD were CO2, COF2, and CO, when O was included in the discharge process. Preliminary results indicated that as high as 65.9% of CF4 was decomposed with CPC operated at 15 kV, 240 Hz for the gas stream containing 300 ppmv CF4, 20% by volume O2, and 40% by volume Ar, with N2 as the carrier gas.","Catalyst; Cf4; Conversion; Dielectric barrier discharge; PFC; Plasma",,,,,,,"Worth, W.F., (1998) A Partnership for PFC Emissions Reductions, , Texas; Ibuka, S., (1998) A Partnership for PFC Emissions Reductions, , Texas; Karecki, S., Pruette, L., Reif, P., (1998) A Partnership for PFC Emissions Reductions, , Technical Programs Present, Texas; Gilliland, T., (1998) A Partnership for PFC Emissions Reductions, , Texas; Hashimoto, T., Kishida, Y., Shirai, Y., Ohmi, T., (1998) A Partnership for PFC Emissions Reductions, , Texas; Hitachi, S.T., Hitachi, S.K., (1998) A Partnership for PFC Emissions Reductions, , Texas; Mendicino, L., Filipiak, S., Boeck, B., Chan, J., Tiemessen, M., (1998) A Partnership for PFC Emissions Reductions, , Texas; Hartz, C.L., Ban, J.W., Jackson, M.W., Wofforo, B.A., (1998) Environ, Sci.
