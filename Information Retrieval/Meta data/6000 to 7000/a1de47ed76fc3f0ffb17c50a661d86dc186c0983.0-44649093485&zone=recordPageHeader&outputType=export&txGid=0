In this study, evaporation heat transfer characteristic and pressure drop of carbon dioxide flowing upward in vertical smooth and micro-fin tubes were investigated by experiment with regard to evaporating temperature, mass flux and heat flux. The vertical smooth and micro-fin tubes with outer diameter (OD) of 5 mm and length of 1.44 m were selected as a test section to measure the evaporative heat transfer coefficient. The tests were conducted at mass fluxes from 212 to 530 kg/(m2 s), saturation temperatures from -5 to 20 °C and heat fluxes from 15 to 45 kW/m2, where the test section was heated by a direct heating method. The differences of heat transfer characteristics between the smooth and the micro-fin tubes were analyzed with respect to enhancement factor (EF) and penalty factor (PF). Average evaporation heat transfer coefficients for the micro-fin tube were approximately 111-207% higher than those for the smooth tube at the same test conditions, and PF was increased from 106 to 123%. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd and IIR.","Carbon dioxide; Evaporation; Heat exchanger; Heat transfer; Microfin tube; Pressure drop; Smooth tube; Vertical tube","Carbon dioxide; Evaporative cooling systems; Heat exchangers; Heat flux; Heat transfer; Pressure drop; Thermal evaporation; Tubes (components); Microfin tubes; Smooth tubes; Vertical tubes; Refrigerants",,,,,,"Cho, J.M., Kim, M.S., Experimental studies on the evaporative heat transfer and pressure drop of CO2 in smooth and micro-fin tubes of the diameter of 5 and 9.52 mm (2007) Int.
