Strategic decision making for major investments can be facilitated by indicators that express the likelihood of costly retrofitting or shut-down of carbon intensive equipment over time. We provide a set of simple indicators that support assessment and decision making in this field. Given a certain emissions target, carbon allowance prices in a cap-and-trade plan will depend on the development of the global economy and the degree to which the target is approached on the global and national levels. The indicators measure the degree to which a given emissions target is approached nationally and assess risks for long-lived investments subject to a range of emissions targets. A comparative case study on existing coal-fired power plants with planned plants and utility-scale photovoltaic power-plants confirms that high risk for coal-fired power plants is emerging. New legislation further confirms this result. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Climate change mitigation; Coal-fired power plant; Economic risks; GHG emission; Global climate changes; Global economies; Global emissions; Long lifetime; National level; Photovoltaic power; Present value; Strategic decision making; Coal fueled furnaces; Coal industry; Decision making; Economics; Fossil fuel power plants; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Mining; Retrofitting; Risk assessment; Risk management; Targets; Coal; carbon; climate change; coal-fired power plant; decision making; emission inventory; environmental economics; environmental legislation; global economy; greenhouse gas; industrial investment; photovoltaic system; risk assessment; trade-environment relations; article; climate change; coal power; decision making; economic aspect; electric power plant; global climate; greenhouse gas; investment; law; risk; Carbon; Coal; Economics; Electricity; Greenhouse Effect; Power Plants; Risk Factors",,"carbon, 7440-44-0; Carbon, 7440-44-0; Coal",,,,"Sautter, J.A., Switzer, C., A change in climate?
