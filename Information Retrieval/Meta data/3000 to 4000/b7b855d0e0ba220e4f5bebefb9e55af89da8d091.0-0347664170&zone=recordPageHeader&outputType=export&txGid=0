This study tested the hypotheses that genotypic differences in rice (Oryza sativa L.) leaf photosynthesis at elevated [CO 2] and temperature are related to protein and gene expression of Rubisco, and that high growth temperatures under elevated [CO2] negatively affect photosystem II (PSII) photochemical efficiency. Two rice cultivars representing an indica (cv. IR72) and japonica type (cv. M103) were grown in 350 (ambient) and 700 (elevated) μmol CO2 mol -1 at 28/18, 34/ 24 and 40/30 °C sinusoidal maximum/minimum, day/night temperatures in outdoor, sunlit, environment-controlled chambers. Leaf photosynthesis of IR72 favoured higher growth temperatures more than M103. Rubisco total activity and protein content were negatively affected in both genotypes by high temperatures and elevated CO2. However, at moderate to high growth temperatures, IR72 leaves averaged 71 and 39% more rbcS transcripts than M103 under ambient and elevated CO2, respectively, and likewise had greater Rubisco activity and protein content. Expression of psbA (D1 protein of PSII) in IR72 leaves increased with temperature, whereas it remained constant for M103, except for a 20% decline at 40/30 °C under elevated CO2. Even at the highest growth temperatures, PSII photochemical efficiency was not impaired in either genotype grown under either ambient or elevated CO2. Genotypic differences exist in rice for carboxylation responses to elevated CO2 and high temperatures, which may be useful in developing genotypes suited to cope with global climate changes.","Carbon assimilation; Carbon dioxide; Gene expression; Heat-stress; Oryza sativa; Photo-inhibition; Ribulose 1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase","carbon dioxide enrichment; gene expression; photoinhibition; photosynthesis; rice; temperature; Japonica; Oryza sativa",,,,,,"Arnon, D.I., Copper enzymes in isolated chloroplasts: Polyphenoloxidase in Beta vulgaris (1949) Plant Physiology, 24, pp. 1-10; Baker, J.T., Allen Jr., L.H., Boote, K.J., Response of rice to carbon dioxide and temperature (1992) Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 60, pp. 153-166; Berry, J., Björkman, O., Photosynthetic response and adaptation to temperature in higher plants (1980) Annual Review of Plant Physiology, 31, pp. 491-543; Bowes, G., Facing the inevitable: Plants and increasing atmospheric CO2 (1993) Annual Review of Plant Physiology and Plant Molecular Biology, 44, pp. 309-332; Crafts-Brandner, S.J., Salvucci, M.E., Rubisco activase constrains the photosynthetic potential of leaves at high temperature and CO2 (2000) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 97, pp. 13430-13435; Cure, J.D., Acock, B., Crop responses to carbon dioxide doubling: A literature survey (1986) Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 38, pp. 127-145; De Vries, S.D., Hodge, H., Bisseling, T., Isolation of total and polysomal RNA from plant tissues (1988) Plant Molecular Biology Manual, B6, pp. 1-13; Delseny, M., Cooke, R., Penon, P., Sequence heterogeneity in radish nuclear ribosomal RNA genes (1983) Plant Science Letters, 30, pp. 107-119; Demmig-Adams, B., Adams, W.W., Photoprotection and other reponses of plants to high light stress (1992) Annual Review of Plant Physiology and Plant Molecular Biology, 43, pp. 599-626; Deng, X.-W., Gruissem, W., Control of plastid gene expression during development: The limited role of transcriptional regulation (1987) Cell, 49, pp. 379-387; Drake, B.C., Gonzàlez-Meler, M.A., Long, S.P., More efficient plants: A consequence of rising atmospheric CO 2?
