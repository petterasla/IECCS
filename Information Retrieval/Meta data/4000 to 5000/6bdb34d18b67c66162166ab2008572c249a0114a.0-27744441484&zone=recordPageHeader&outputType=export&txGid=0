Increasing renewable energy and promoting energy efficiency and conservation will be a sensible strategy towards carbon dioxide capture and storage. CO 2 capture can be divided into three categories - post-combustion, pre-combustion and oxyfuel combustion. Out of these, pre-combustion is the most efficient and cheapest. Once the CO 2 is separated and captured, it is pressed to reduce the volume of gas for transportation to an appropriate storage location.",,"Oxyfuel combustion; Post-combustion; Pre-combustion; Carbon dioxide; Climatology; Combustion; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Environmental impact; Gas fuel storage",,,,,,,"Stephens, J.C.; Department of Environmental Science and Policy, Clark University, Worcester, MA, United States; email: jstephens@clarku.edu",,,,,,,,07485492,,ISTEE,,"English","Issues Sci Technol",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-27744441484
