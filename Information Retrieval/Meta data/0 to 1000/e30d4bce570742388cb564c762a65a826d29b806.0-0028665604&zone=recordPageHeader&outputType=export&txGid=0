Projections of future emissions are combined with GWPs to present a picture of the overall potential of future car transport emissions to affect the global climate. The projections from this modelling exercise point to the fact that the car transport sector will not be able to meet the international target of returning emissions of greenhouse gases to their 1990 levels by 2000. Technological improvements will help to keep in check the total warming impact of car transport in the near future by reducing non-carbon dioxide emissions. However, eventually demand increases will overcome this benefit unless further improvements, particularly in CO2 emissions, can be achieved. This suggests a need for prompt introduction of longer-term measures to manage demand and increase trip efficiency. The results of our sensitivity analysis suggest that more work to better determine nitrous oxide emissions factors should be given priority, that increasing diesel market share has little impact, and that the uncertainties over actual GWP values do not appear to have a significant impact on the total warming potential of passenger car emissions. © 1994.","Climate change; Global warming potentials; Transport emissions","Automobiles; Carbon dioxide; Climatology; Energy policy; Forecasting; Hydrocarbons; Mathematical models; Motor transportation; Nitrogen oxides; Sensitivity analysis; Technology; Climate change; Global warming potential; Greenhouse gases; Transport emissions; Particulate emissions; automobile emission; climatic change; future prospect; global warming; pollution problem; UK",,,,,,"This Common Inheritance (1992) Second Year Report, , HMSO, London, Cm 2068; Fergusson, Holman, Barrett, (1989) Atmospheric Emissions from the Use of Transport in the United Kingdom, Vol 1: The Estimation of Current and Future Emissions, , World Wide Fund for Nature, Godalming; Fergusson, Holman, (1990) Atmospheric Emissions from the Use of Transport in the United Kingdom, Vol 2: The Effect of Alternative Transport Policies, , World Wide Fund for Nature, Godalming; Taylor, Fergusson, (1993) Energy Use and Air Pollution in UK Road Freight, , World Wide Fund for Nature, Godalming; The Earth Resources Research model was developed with funding from WWF, for use in work to forecast emissions from the UK transport sector.
