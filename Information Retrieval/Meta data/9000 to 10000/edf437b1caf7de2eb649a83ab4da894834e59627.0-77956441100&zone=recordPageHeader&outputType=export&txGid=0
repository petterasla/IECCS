Understanding carbon (C) dynamics in soil is important for assessing the soil C sequestration potential under elevated [CO2]. Nitrogen (N) is often regarded as a limiting factor in the soil C sequestration under future CO2 enrichment environment. However, few studies have been carried out to examine what would happen in the subtropical or tropical areas where the ambient N deposition is high. In this study, we used open-top chambers to study the effect of elevated atmospheric [CO2] alone and together with N addition on the soil C dynamics in the first 4 years of the treatments applied in southern China.Materials and methods Above- and below-ground C input (tree biomass) into soil, soil respiration, soil organic C, and total N as well as dissolved organic C (DOC) were measured periodically in each of the open-top chambers. Soil samples were collected randomly in each chamber from each of the soil layers (0-20, 20-40, and 40-60 cm) using a standard soil sampling tube (2.5-cminside diameter). Soil leachates were collected at the bottom of the chamber below-ground walls in stainless steel boxes.Results and discussion The highest above- and below- ground C input into soil was found in the high CO2 and high N treatment (CN), followed by the only high N treatment (N+), the only high CO2 treatment (C+), and then the control (CK) without any CO2 enrichment or N addition. DOC in the leachates was small for all the treatments. Export of DOC played a minor role in C cycling in our experiment. Generally, soil respiration rate in the chambers followed the order: CN treatment&gt;C+treatment&gt; N+treatment&gt;thecontrol.ExceptfortheC+treatment,there were no significant differences in soil total N among the CN treatment, N + treatment, and the control. Overall, soil organic C (SOC) was significantly affected by the treatments (p&lt;0.0001). SOC for all the soil layers in the treatments followed the order: CN treatment&gt;N+treatment&gt;C+ treatment=CK treatment. Compared with the control, the higher SOC in the CN and N+ treatment was due to the greater above- and below-ground C input. The increased soil respiration in the C+ treatment led to the lower SOC. Conclusions Elevated atmospheric [CO2] in the subtropical China accelerated soil C sequestration in this area; however, this increase would still need additional N input. The increased soil C pool was due to the enhanced tree growth. Special climatic condition in this area and the high density of tree planting might further accelerate soil C sequestration in this area. © Springer-Verlag 2010.","Carbon dioxide enrichment; Nitrogen addition; Soil organic C; Soilrespiration; Subtropical forest soil; Tree biomass","atmospheric deposition; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; forest soil; phytomass; soil carbon; soil organic matter; soil respiration; China",,,,,,"Bernhardt, E.S., Barber, J.J., Pippen, J.S., Taneva, L., Andrews, J.A., Schlesinger, W.H., Long-term effects of free air CO2 enrichment (FACE) on soil respiration (2006) Biogeochem, 77, pp. 91-116; Bowden, R.D., Davidson, E., Savage, K., Arabia, C., Steudler, P., Chronic nitrogen additions reduce total soil respiration and microbial respiration intemperate forest soils at the Harvard forest (2004) For Ecol Manag, 196, pp. 43-56; de Graaff, M., van Groenigen, K., Six, J., van Kessel, C., Interactions between plant growth and soil nutrient cycling under elevated CO2: A meta-analysis (2006) Glob Change Biol, 12, pp. 2077-2091; Deforest, J.L., Zak, D.R., Pregitzer, K.S., Burton, A.J., Atmospherenitrate deposition and the microbial degradation of cellobiose and vanillinin a northern hardwood forest (2004) Soil Biol Biochem, 36, pp. 965-971; Gill, R.A., Polley, H.W., Johnson, H.B., Anderson, L.J., Maherali, H., Jackson, R.B., Nonlinear grassland responses to past and future atmospheric CO2 (2002) Nature, 417, pp. 279-282; Gulde, S., Chung, H., Amelung, W., Chang, C., Six, J., Soil carbon saturation controls labile and stable carbon pool dynamics (2008) SoilSci Soc Am J, 72, pp. 605-612; Hagedorn, F., Blaser, P., Siegwolf, R., Elevated atmospheric CO2 and increased N deposition effects on dissolved organic carbon-clues from δ13C signature (2002) Soil Biol Biochem, 34, pp. 355-366; Hagedorn, F., Spinnler, D., Bundt, M., Blaser, P., Siegwolf, R., The input and fate of new C in two forest soils under elevated CO2 (2003) Glob Change Biol, 9, pp. 862-873; Hessen, D.O., Agren, G.I., Anderson, T.R., Elser, J.J., de Ruiter, P.C., Carbon sequestration in ecosystems: The role of stoichiometry (2004) Ecology, 85, pp. 1179-1192; Huang, Y., Eglindton, G., de van Hage, E.R.E., Boon, J.J., Bol, R., Ineson, P., Dissolved organic matter and its parent organic matter in grass upland soil horizons studied by analytical pyrolysis techniques (1998) Eur J Soil Sci, 49, pp. 1-5; Hungate, B.A., Dukes, J.S., Shaw, M.R., Luo, Y., Field, C.B., Nitrogen and climate change (2003) Science, 302, pp. 1512-1513; Hungate, B.A., Jackson, R.B., Field, C.B., Chapin, F.S.I., Detecting changes in soil carbon in CO2 enrichment experiments (1996) Plant Soil, 187, pp. 135-145; Jackson, M.L., (1964) Soil Chemical Analysis, pp. 86-92. , Prentice-Hall Inc, Englewood Cliffs, New York; Jastrow, J., Miller, R.M., Matamala, R., Norbyw, R.J., Bouttonz, T.W., Rice, C.W., Owensby, C., Elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide increases soil carbon (2005) Glob Change Biol, 11, pp. 2057-2064; King, J.S., Pregitzer, K.S., Zak, D.R., Sober, J., Isebrands, J.G., Dickson, R.E., Hendrey, G.R., Karnosky, D.F., Fine-root biomass and fluxes of soil carbon in young stands of paper birch and trembling aspen as affected by elevated atmospheric CO2 and tropospheric O3 (2001) Oecologia, 128, pp. 237-250; Kong, A.Y.Y., Six, J., Bryant, D.C., Denison, R.F., van Kessel, C., The relationship between carbon input, aggregation, and soil organic carbon stabilization in sustainable cropping systems (2005) Soil Sci Soc Am J, 69, pp. 1078-1085; Lichter, J., Barron, S.H., Bevacqua, C.E., Finzi, A.C., Irving, K.F., Stemmler, E.A., Schlesinger, W.H., Soil carbon sequestration and turnover in a pine forest after six years of atmospheric CO2 enrichment (2005) Ecology, 86, pp. 1835-1847; Liu, J.X., Zhang, D.Q., Zhou, G.Y., Faivre-Vuillin, B., Deng, Q., Wang, C.L., CO2 enrichment increases nutrient leaching from model forest ecosystems in subtropical China (2008) Biogeosci, 5, pp. 1783-1795; Luo, Y., Hui, D., Zhang, D., Elevated carbon dioxide stimulates net accumulations of carbon and nitrogen in terrestrial ecosystems: A meta-analysis (2006) Ecology, 87, pp. 53-63; Mo, J.M., Brown, S., Xue, J.H., Fang, Y.T., Li, Z.A., Response of litter decomposition to simulated N deposition in disturbed, rehabilitated and mature forests of subtropical China (2006) Plant Soil, 282, pp. 135-151; Moore, T.R., Dissolved organic carbon: Sources, sinks, and fluxes and role in the soil carbon cycle (1997) Soil Processes and The Carbon Cycle, pp. 281-292. , In: Lal R, Kimble JM, Follett RF, Stewart BA, CRC Press, Boca Raton; Nelson, D.W., Sommers, L.E., Carbon and organic matter (1982) Logical Properties.
