Although several recent research papers have attempted to quantify the effects of BC on climate, not all these analyses have incorporated all the mechanisms that contribute to its RF (including the effects of BC on cloud albedo, cloud coverage, and snow and ice albedo, and the optical consequences of aerosol mixing) and have reported their results in different units and with different ranges of uncertainty. Here we attempt to reconcile their results and present them in uniform units that include the same forcing factors. We use the best estimate of effective RF obtained from these results to analyze the benefits of mitigating BC emissions for achieving a specific equilibrium temperature target. For a 500 ppm CO2e (3.1 Wm -2) effective RF target in 2100, which would offer about a 50% chance of limiting equilibrium warming to 2.5°C above preindustrial temperatures, we estimate that failing to reduce carbonaceous aerosol emissions from contained combustion would require CO2 emission cuts about 8 years (range of 1-15 years) earlier than would be necessary with full mitigation of these emissions.","Aerosols; Air pollution; Climate change; Radiative forcing","black carbon; carbon dioxide; aerosol; article; climate; combustion; environmental impact assessment; exhaust gas; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; priority journal; radiative forcing; temperature",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4",,,,"Ramanathan, V., Carmichael, G., Global and regional climate changes due to black carbon (2008) Nat Geosci, 1, pp. 221-227; Forster, P., Changes in atmospheric constituents and in radiative forcing (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis, pp. 130-234. , eds S Solomon et al.
