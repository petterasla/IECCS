In this paper, four sets of comparable R410A and R22 split-type residential A/C (air conditioners) were developed and then their performance was comparatively studied using one simulation software. The A/C performance compared in this paper included the cooling capacity, EER (energy efficiency ratio), annual power consumption of A/C and the global warming impact of refrigerants adopted by the A/C. It was concluded that the adoption of R410A could be helpful for A/C to decrease their heat exchanger size or improve their operation efficiency for power saving. Moreover, compared to R22, R410A could in fact help alleviate its overall impact on global warming through significantly reducing the indirect global warming impact caused by operating R410A A/C. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
