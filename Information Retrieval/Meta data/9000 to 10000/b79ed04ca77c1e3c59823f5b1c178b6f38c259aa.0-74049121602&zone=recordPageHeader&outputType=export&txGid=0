We quantified changes in fish assemblages within seagrass meadows of the northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM) between the 1970s and 2006-2007, and observed changes consistent with this forecast. During 2006-2007 we sampled seagrass meadows using the same gears and methods previously employed by R. J. Livingston in coastal waters of northwest Florida throughout the 1970s. Comparisons between datasets revealed numerous additions to the fish fauna during 2006-2007 that were completely absent in the 1970s, including: Lutjanus synagris (lane snapper), Epinephelus morio (red grouper), Chaetodon ocellatus (spotfin butterflyfish), Mycteroperca sp (grouper, non gag), Centropristis philadelphica (rock sea bass), Fistularia tabacaria (bluespotted cornetfish), Ocyurus chrysurus (yellowtail snapper), Thalassoma bifasciatum (bluehead wrasse), Abudefduf saxatilis (sergeant major), Acanthuridae spp. (surgeonfishes) and Sparisoma viride (stoplight parrotfish). Several other species showed large increases in abundance during the interval between 1979 and 2006, including Mycteroperca microlepis (gag grouper, up ~ 200×), Lutjanus griseus (gray snapper, up ~ 105×), and Nicholsina usta (emerald parrotfish, up ~ 22×). All of these are tropical or subtropical species that now make up a greater percentage of seagrass-associated fish assemblages in the northern GOM than in the past. Additionally, we observed regional increases in air and sea surface temperatures (>3°C) during the ~ 30 years that separate Livingston's samples and ours that correlate with northern shifts in the distribution of warm-water fishes. Documenting these range shifts is a critical first step in investigating the consequences of global warming for endemic marine communities and fishery production in the northern GOM. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Climate change; Community composition; Geographic range shifts; Ichthyofauna; Seagrass; Species distributions; Temperature records","abundance; air temperature; climate change; climate effect; community composition; endemic species; fish; fishery production; geographical distribution; ichthyofauna; range expansion; sea surface temperature; temperature effect; Atlantic Ocean; Gulf of Mexico; Abudefduf; Abudefduf saxatilis; Acanthuridae; Centropristis philadelphica; Chaetodon ocellatus; Epinephelinae; Epinephelus morio; Fistularia tabacaria; Lutjanus griseus; Lutjanus synagris; Mycteroperca; Mycteroperca microlepis; Nicholsina usta; Ocyurus chrysurus; Pisces; Sparisoma viride; Thalassoma bifasciatum; Thalassoma lucasanum",,,,,,"Acosta, A., Bartels, C., Colvocoresses, J., Greenwood, M.F.D., Fish assemblages in seagrass habitats of the Florida Keys, Florida: spatial and temporal characteristics (2007) Bulletin of Marine Science, 81, pp. 1-19; Appenzellar, C., Stocker, T.F., Anklin, M., North Atlantic Oscillation dynamics recorded in Greenland ice cores (1998) Science, 282, pp. 446-449; Barry, J.P., Baxter, C.H., Sagarin, R.D., Gilman, S.E., Climate-related, long-term faunal changes in a California rocky intertidal community (1995) Science, 267, pp. 672-675; Byron, D., Heck K.L., Jr., Hurricane effects on seagrass along Alabama's Gulf Coast (2006) Estuaries and Coasts, 29, pp. 939-942; Checkley, D.M., Raman, S., Maillet, G.L., Mason, K.M., Winter storm effects on the spawning and larval drift of a pelagic fish (1988) Nature, 335, pp. 346-348; Childs, J., Range extension of Mobula tarapacana into the northwestern Gulf of Mexico (1997) Gulf of Mexico Science, 15, p. 39; Coleman, F.C., Figueria, W.F., Ueland, J.S., Crowder, L.B., The impact of United States recreational fisheries on marine fish populations (2004) Science, 305, pp. 1958-1959; Cuevas, K.J., Franks, J.S., Buchanan, M.V., First record of bonefish, Albula vulpes, from Mississippi coastal waters (2004) Gulf and Caribbean Research, 16, pp. 71-72; Duffy, J.E., Biodiversity and the functioning of seagrass ecosystems (2006) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 311, pp. 233-250; Fertl, D., Schiro, A.J., Regan, G.T., Manatee occurrence in the northern Gulf of Mexico, west of Florida (2005) Gulf and Caribbean Research, 17, pp. 69-94; Field, D.B., Baumgartner, T.R., Charles, C.D., Ferreira-Bartrina, V., Ohman, M.D., Planktonic foraminifera of the California Current reflect 20th-century warming (2006) Science, 311, pp. 63-66; Franks, J.S., First record of goliath grouper, Epinephelus itajara, from Mississippi coastal waters with comments on the first documented occurrence of red grouper, Epinephelus morio, off Mississippi (2005) Proceedings, Gulf Caribbean Fisheries Institute, 56, pp. 295-304; Gaylord, B., Gaines, S.D., Temperature or transport?
