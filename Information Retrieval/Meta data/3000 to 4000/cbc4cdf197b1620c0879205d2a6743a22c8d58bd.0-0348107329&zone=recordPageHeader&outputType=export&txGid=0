It is also expected that the freshwater input to high northern latitudes will increase as human-induced global warming continues, with potential impacts on the AMOC. Here we present results from a 150 years sensitivity experiment with the Bergen Climate Model (BCM) for the present-day climate, but with enhanced runoff from the Arctic region throughout the integration. The AMOC drops by 30% over the first 50 years, followed by a gradual recovery. The simulated response indicates that the present-day AMOC might be robust to the isolated effect of enhanced, high-latitude freshwater forcing on a centennial time scale, and that the western tropical North Atlantic may provide key information about the long-term variability, and by that monitoring, of the AMOC.",,"Atmospheric movements; Computer simulation; Global warming; Bergen climate model (BCM); Freshwater forcing; Glacial geology; atmosphere-ocean coupling; freshwater input; meridional circulation; overturn; thermohaline circulation; Atlantic Ocean",,,,,,"Aagaard, K., Carmack, E.C., The role of sea ice and other fresh water in the Arctic Circulation (1989) J.
