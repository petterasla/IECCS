All life cycle inventory data were recalculated per functional unit, which was defined as treatment of 1 m3 of textile wastewater. Evaporator consumes 48 % of electricity, which contributes for more global warming potential (GWP) than other treatment units. Total GWP for plant I and II are 4.49 kg CO2eq and 5.56 kg CO2eq respectively. During electricity generation, CO2 emission is comparatively high (98.5 % of total emissions). The results indicate that RO system of plant I and II consumes less energy and GWP are 8.9 × 10-3 kg CO2 eq and 0.011 kg CO2 eq respectively. Human health impact is 7.4 E-05 for CO2 emission, which is less for other emissions. The results can be used for strategic decisions for minimizing environmental impacts of zero liquid treatment technologies.","Life cycle assessment; Life cycle inventory; Reverse osmosis; Zero liquid discharge","Carbon dioxide; Evaporators; Gas emissions; Global warming; Health risks; Reverse osmosis; Textile industry; Wastewater treatment; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; discharge; environmental assessment; environmental impact; life cycle analysis; osmosis; textile industry; waste treatment; wastewater; Asia; Eurasia; India; South Asia; Tamil Nadu; Tirupur",,,,,,"Zhou, H., Smith, D.W., Advance technologies in water and wastewater treatment (2002) J Environ Engg & Sci, 1, pp. 247-264; Angela Arpke, N.H.P.E., Asce, M., Operational Life-Cycle Assessment and Life Cycle cost analysis for water use in multi occupant buildings (2005) J Architect Engg, 11, pp. 99-109; Ortiz, M., Raluy, G., Serra, L., Uche, J., Life cycle assessment of water treatment technologies: Wastewater and water reuse in a small town (2007) Desalination, 204, pp. 121-131; Silvestraviciute, I., Karaliunaite, I., Life cycle Inventory analysis (2006) Environ Res, Engg Manage, 1, pp. 52-60. , Comparison of End-of-life tyre treatment technologies; Finnveden, G., Lindfors, L.-G., Data quality of life cycle inventory data-rules of thumb (1998) Int J LCA, 3, pp. 65-66; Gerilla, G.P., Teknomo, K., Hokao, K., An environmental assessment of wood and steel reinforced concrete housing construction (2007) Building & Environment, 42, pp. 2778-2784; David, V.S., Gregory, A.K., (2005) Life Cycle Environmental and Economic Assessment of Willow Biomass Electricity: A Comparison with Other Renewable and Non-Renewable Sources, , http://css.snre.umich.edu, Centre for sustainable systems, University of Michigan; Transport Fuel Quality for 2005, , CPCB, Central Pollution Control Board, New Delhi; Landu L & Alan C Brent, Environmental life cycle assessment of water supply in South Africa : The Rosslyn industrial area as a case study, Water SA, 32 (2006) 249-256Raluy, R.G., Serra, L., Uche, J., Valero, A., Life-cycle assessment of desalination technologies integrated with energy production systems (2004) Desalination, 167, pp. 445-458; Martens, W.J.M., Global atmospheric and human health: An integrated modeling approach (1996) Climate research, 6, pp. 107-112; Koroneos, C., Roumbas, G., Gabari, Z., papagiannidou, E., Moussiopoulos, N., Life cycle assessment of beer production in Greece (2005) J Cleaner Production, 13, pp. 433-439; Goralczyk, M., Life cycle assessment in the renewable energy sector (2003) Appl energy, 75, pp. 205-211; Gerilla, G.P., Teknomo, K., Hokao, K., Environmental assessment of International transportation of products (2005) J Eastern Asia Soc for Transportation Studies, 6, pp. 3167-3182","Rajakumari, S.P.; Centre for Environmental Studies, Anna University, Chennai 600 025, India",,,,,,,,00224456,,,,"English","J.
