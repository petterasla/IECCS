Comparative studies of peat bogs along present climatic gradients may provide an insight into the future response of boreal and subarctic peatlands to changing temperature and moisture. Three maritime peat bogs in the British Isles, and two high-elevation peatlands in the Czech Republic were studied. All sites were relatively wet, the mean annual temperatures were higher by up to 6 °C at the British/Irish sites than at the Czech sites. Cumulative carbon content in 210Pb-dated Sphagnum-dominated vertical peat cores increased from the warmer to the colder sites when evaluated for the most recent decades (since ca. 1950). That would correspond to formation of thinner, more highly decomposed peat deposits over the long-term in warmer conditions, and deeper peat bogs in colder conditions. However, when cumulative carbon content was evaluated for the last ca. 150 years, no relationship was found between mean annual temperature and the carbon pool size. Even along broad present-day climatic gradients, site-specific factors controlled organic carbon preservation in peat. Pollen analysis was instrumental in corroborating the 210Pb dates, identifying wet and dry periods in the past, and it also provided evidence for increasing nitrogen loads in wetland areas. © 2007.","Carbon cycling; Climate change; Organic matter; Peat; Sphagnum","Biological materials preservation; Global warming; Peat; Pyrolysis; Wetlands; Carbon cycling; Climatic gradients; Freshwater peatlands; Sphagnum; Organic carbon; fresh water; lead 210; nitrogen; organic carbon; accumulation; carbon cycle; climate change; comparative study; freshwater environment; global climate; greenhouse gas; moss; organic carbon; palynology; peatland; article; carbon cycling; comparative study; Europe; global climate; greenhouse effect; peatland; pollen analysis; priority journal; Sphagnum; sphagnum auriculatum; sphagnum capillifolium; sphagnum compactum; sphagnum cuspidatum; sphagnum fallax; sphagnum girgensohnii; sphagnum imbricatum; sphagnum megallanicum; sphagnum palustre; sphagnum papillosum; sphagnum plumulosum; sphagnum recurvum; sphagnum riparium; sphagnum russowii; sphagnum subsecundum; sphagnum tenellum; temperature acclimatization; Carbon; Climate; Czech Republic; Ecosystem; Europe; Fresh Water; Great Britain; Greenhouse Effect; Ireland; Lead Radioisotopes; Pollen; Soil; Wetlands; Central Europe; Czech Republic; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe; Sphagnum",,"lead 210, 14255-04-0; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; Carbon, 7440-44-0; Lead Radioisotopes; Soil",,,,"Aerts, R., de Caluwe, H., Nitrogen deposition effects on carbon dioxide and methane emissions from temperate peatland soils (1999) Oikos, 84, pp. 44-54; Appleby, P.G., Oldfield, F., The calculation of 210Pb dates assuming a constant rate of supply of unsupported 210Pb to the sediment (1978) Catena, 5, pp. 1-8; Belyea, L.R., Malmer, N., Carbon sequestration in peatland: patterns and mechanisms of response to climate change (2004) Glob Chang Biol, 10, pp. 1043-1052; Blodau, C., Basiliko, N., Moore, T.R., Carbon turnover in peatland mesocosms exposed to different water table levels (2004) Biogeochemistry, 67, pp. 331-351; Borren, W., Bleuten, W., Lapshina, E.D., Holocene peat and carbon accumulation rates in the southern taiga of western Siberia (2004) Quat Res, 61, pp. 42-51; Bridgham, S.D., Updegraff, K., Pastor, J., Carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus mineralization in northern wetlands (1998) Ecology, 79, pp. 1545-1561; Bridgham, S.D., Megonigal, J.P., Keller, J.K., Bliss, N.B., Trettin, C., The carbon balance of North American wetlands (2006) Wetlands, 26, pp. 1-23; Cameron, C.C., Peat (1968) Mineral resources of the Appalachian Region.
