Climate change could affect rice growth and development and thus jeopardize Thailand's wealth. Current climatic conditions in Thailand are compared to predictions from four general circulation models (GCMs). Temperature predictions correlate well with the observed values. Predictions of monthly rainfall correlate poorly. Virtually all models agree that significant increases in temperature (from 1 to 7 °C) will occur in the region including Thailand following a doubling in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration. The regional seasonality and extent of the rise in temperature varies with each model. Predictions of changes in rainfall vary widely between models. Global warming should in principle allow a northward expansion of rice-growing areas and a lengthening of the growing season now constrained by low temperatures. The expected increase in water-use efficiency due to enhanced CO2 might decrease the water deficit vulnerability of dryland rice areas and could make it possible to slightly expand them. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,,,,,,"Ackerman, T.P., Cropper, W.P., Scaling Global Climate Projections to Local Biological Assessments (1988) Environment, 30, pp. 31-34; Ada, R.M., McCarl, B.A., Dudek, D.J., Glyer, J.D., Implications of Global Climate Change for Western Agriculture (1988) Western J.
