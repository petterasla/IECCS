In some of the models, the magnitude of this positive feedback is as large as the CO2 forcing itself. The models agree well on the surface contribution to the trend, due to retreating snow and ice cover, but display large differences when it comes to the contribution from shortwave radiative effects of clouds. The ""cloud contribution"" defined as the difference between clear-sky and all-sky albedo anomalies and denoted as ΔCC is correlated with equilibrium climate sensitivity in the models (correlation coefficient 0. 76), indicating that in high sensitivity models the clouds to a greater extent act to enhance the negative clear-sky albedo trend, whereas in low sensitivity models the clouds rather counteract this trend. As a consequence, the total albedo trend is more negative in more sensitive models (correlation coefficient 0. 73). This illustrates in a new way the importance of cloud response to global warming in determining climate sensitivity in models. The cloud contribution to the albedo trend can primarily be ascribed to changes in total cloud fraction, but changes in cloud albedo may also be of importance. © 2011 The Author(s).",,"albedo; carbon dioxide; clear sky; climate feedback; climate forcing; climate modeling; cloud radiative forcing; global warming; ice cover; sensitivity analysis; shortwave radiation; snow cover; trend analysis",,,,,,"Bender, F.A.-M., Rodhe, H., Charlson, R.J., Ekman, A.M.L., Loeb, N., 22 views of the global albedo-comparison between 20 GCMs and two satellites (2006) Tellus A, 58 (3), pp. 320-330; Cahalan, R.F., Ridgway, W., Wiscombe, W.J., Bell, T.L., Snider, J.B., The albedo of fractal stratocumulus clouds (1994) J Atmos Sci, 51, pp. 2434-2460; Cess, R.D., Climate change: an appraisal of atmospheric feedback mechanisms employing zonal climatology (1976) J Atmos Sci, 33, pp. 1831-1843; Cess, R.D., Potter, G.L., Blanchet, J.P., Boer, G.J., del Genio, A.D., Déqué, M., Dymnikov, V., Yagai, I., Intercomparison and interpretation of climate feedback processes in 19 atmospheric general circulation models (1990) J Geophys Res, 95 (D10), pp. 601-615; Cess, R.D., Zhang, M.H., Ingram, W.J., Potter, G.L., Alekseev, V., Barker, H.W., Cohen-Solal, E., Wetherald, R.T., Cloud feedback in atmospheric general circulation models: an update (1996) J Geophys Res, 101 (D8), pp. 791-794; Dufresne, J.-L., Bony, S., An assessment of the primary sources of spread of global warming estimates from coupled atmosphere ocean models (2008) J Climate, 21, pp. 5135-5144; Dufresne, J.-L., Quaas, J., Boucher, O., Denvil, S., Fairhead, L., Contrasts in the effects on climate of anthropogenic sulfate aerosols between the 20th and the 21st century (2005) Geophys Res Lett, 32, pp. L21703; Meehl, G.A., Covey, C., Delworth, T., Latif, M., McAvaney, B., Mitchell, J.F.B., Stouffer, R.J., Taylor, K.E., The WCRP CMIP3 multimodel dataset: a new era in climate change research (2007) Bull Am Meteorol Soc, 88, pp. 1383-1394; Moberg, A., Sonechkin, D.M., Holmgren, K., Datsenko, N.M., Karlén, W., Highly variable Northern Hemisphere temperatures reconstructed from low- and high-resolution proxy data (2005) Nature, 433, pp. 613-617; Myhre, G., Highwood, E.J., Shine, K.P., Stordal, F., New estimates of radiative forcing due to well mixed greenhouse gases (1998) Geophys Res Lett, 25, pp. 2715-2718; Ramaswamy, V., Chen, C.-T., An investigation of the global solar radiative forcing due to changes in cloud liquid water path (1993) J Geophys Res, 98, pp. 16703-16712; Ringer, M.A., McAvaney, B.J., Andronova, N., Buja, L.E., Esch, M., Ingram, W.J., Li, B., Williams, K.D., Global mean cloud feedbacks in idealized climate change experiments (2006) Geophys Res Lett, 33, pp. L07718; Roesch, A., Evaluation of surface albedo and snow cover in AR4 coupled climate models (2006) J Geophys Res, 111, pp. D15111; Soden, B.J., Broccoli, A.J., Hemler, R.S., On the use of cloud forcing to estimate cloud feedback (2004) J Climate, 17, pp. 3661-3665; Soden, B.J., Held, I.M., An assessment of climate feedbacks in coupled ocean-atmosphere models (2006) J Climate, 19, pp. 3354-3360","Bender, F.
