It is expected that new in vitro techniques in combination with conventional breeding methods may effectively raise the yield potential. On the other hand, there are many environmental problems to be solved world-wide such as, global warming, environmental pollution, ecological destruction, reduction in water supplies and so on. Therefore, it is necessary to rapidly develop new varieties for the future combining of higher yield potential with excellent grain quality, and resistance to both biotic and abiotic stresses for the promotion of sustainable agriculture. Although many efforts have been made to introduce useful traits from wild species to cultivated rice via hybridization, it is still difficult to overcome breeding barriers such as cross incompatibility and hybrid sterility and inviability in practical breeding. Now in vitro techniques are going to make it possible to use genetic manipulation and cell culture and fusion techniques to speed up the breeding process. For sustainable agriculture, it is important to utilize the useful genes from alien species. For this purpose, asymmetric protoplast fusions have already been used successfully to transfer disease resistance in Brassica napus. In this experiment, a high level of resistance to the rice blast disease was transferred from wild species through asymmetric fusions. It is also noted that manipulation of cytoplasmic genomes is possible through asymmetric fusions as shown in the induction of new cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS).","Asymmetric somatic hybrids; In-situ hybridization; Oryza species; Protoplast fusion; Ribosomal DNA gene; Rice blast resistance","crop improvement; cytoplasmic male sterility; disease resistance gene; gene transfer; genetic incompatibility; genetic modification; plant breeding; plant yield; protoplast fusion; sustainable agriculture; wild relative",,,,,,"Aviv, D., Arzee-Gonen, P., Bleichman, S., Galun, E., Novel alloplasmic Nicotiana plants by 'donor-recipient' protoplast fusion: Cybrids having N. sylvestris nuclear genomes and chondriomes from alien species (1984) Mol Gen Genet, 196, pp. 244-253; Brar, D.S., Khush, G.S., Alien introgression in rice (1997) Plant Mol Biol, 35, pp. 35-47; Escalante, A., Imanishi, S., Hossain, M., Ohmido, N., Fukui, K., RFLP analysis and genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) in somatic hybrids and their progeny between Lycopersicon esculentum & Solarium lycopersicoides (1998) Theor Appl Genet, 96, pp. 719-726; Fukui, K., Ohmido, N., Khush, G.S., Variability in rDNA loci in the genus Oryza detected through fluorescence in situ hybridization (1994) Theor Appl Genet, 87, pp. 893-899; Izhar, S., Schlicter, M., Swartzberg, D., Sorting out of cytoplasmic elements in somatic hybrids of petunia and prevalence of the heteroplasmon through several meiotic cycles (1983) Mol Gen Genet, 190, pp. 468-474; Jacobsen, E., De Jong, H.J., Kamstra, S.A., Van Den Berg, P.M.M.M., Ramanna, M.S., Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and RFLP analysis for the identification of alien chromosomes in the backcross progeny of potato (+) tomato fusion hybrids (1995) Heredity, 74, pp. 250-257; Kadowaki, K.T., Suzuki, T., Azama, S., A chimeric gene containing the 5 portion of atp6 is associated with cytoplasmic male-sterility of rice (1990) Mol Gen Genet, 224, pp. 10-16; Kamisugi, Y., Nakayama, S., Nakajima, R., Ohtsubo, H., Ohtsubo, E., Fukui, K., Physical mapping of the 5S ribosomal RNA genes on rice chromosome II (1994) Mol Gen Genet, 245, pp. 133-138; Kyozuka, J., Hayashi, H., Shimamoto, K., High frequency plant regeneration from rice protoplasts by novel nurse culture method (1987) Mol Gen Genet, 206, pp. 408-413; Melzer, J.M., O'Connell, M.A., Effect of radiation dose on the production of and the extent of asymmetry in tomato asymmetric somatic hybrids (1992) Theor Appl Genet, 83, pp. 337-344; Ohmido, N., Fukui, K., Cytological studies of African cultivated rice, Oryza glaberrima (1995) Theor Appl Genet, 91, pp. 212-217; Oono, K., Putative homozygous mutations in regenerated plants of rice (1985) Mol Gen Genet, 198, pp. 377-384; Song, Y.C., Gustafson, J.P., Physical mapping of the 5S rDNA gene complex in rice (Oryza sativa) (1993) Genome, 36, pp. 658-661; Tanksley, S.D., McCouch, S.R., Seed banks and molecular maps: Unlocking genetic potential from the wild (1997) Science, 277, pp. 1063-1066; Walters, T.W., Earle, E.D., Organellar segregation, rearrangement and recombination in protoplast fusion-derived Brassica oleracea calli (1993) Theor Appl Genet, 85, pp. 761-769; Wolters, A.M.A., Schoenmakers, H.C.H., Koornneef, M., Chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA composition of triploid and tetraploid somatic hybrids between Lycopersicon esculentum and Solanum tuberosum (1995) Theor Appl Genet, 90, pp. 285-293","Kinoshita, T.; Faculty of Agriculture, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-8589, Japan",,,,,,,,00142336,,EUPHA,,"English","Euphytica",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034792824
