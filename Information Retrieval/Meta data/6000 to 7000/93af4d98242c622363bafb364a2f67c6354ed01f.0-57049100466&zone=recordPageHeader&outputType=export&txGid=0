The average monthly spring discharge is high in Triassic Limestone-controlled springs (karst springs) and low in alluvium- and Karewa-controlled springs. In general, the measured monthly spring discharges show an inverse relation with the monthly precipitation data. However, a direct correlation exists between the spring discharges and the degree of snow/ice melt. The results suggest that the creation of a low and continuous (but stable) recharge from the Triassic Limestone and Panjal Trap aquifers, due to blockage of groundwater flow between strata with contrasting hydraulic conductivity, attenuates the discharge and gives rise to small fluctuations in the alluvium- and Karewa-controlled springs. The average monthly discharge of the karst and alluvial springs showed an overall decreasing trend for two and a half decades, with the lowest discharge recorded in 2001. The study revealed that the regional/ global warming and below-normal precipitation in the period of snow accumulation (PSA) has triggered the receding of glaciers and attenuation of spring discharges. © Springer-Verlag 2008.","Climate change; Glacier recession; Groundwater flow; India; Karst","aquifer; climate change; climate variation; correlation; discharge; glacier; groundwater flow; karst; lithology; regional climate; snow accumulation; spring water; Asia; Eurasia; India; Jammu and Kashmir; Kashmir Valley; South Asia",,,,,,"Ahmad, N., Hashmi, M.H., Glacial history of Kolahoi glacier, Kashmir India (1974) J Glaciol, 13 (68), pp. 279-283; Alley, W.M., Ground water and climate (2001) Ground Water, 39 (2), p. 161; Bahadur, J., Water resources management in the Himalayan region (2000) Proceedings of the Internal Conference on Managing Natural Resources for Sustainable Agricultural Production in the 21st Century, pp. 459-461. , New Delhi, 14-18 Feb 2000; Bajjali, W., Recharge mechanism and hydrochemistry evaluation of groundwater in the Nuaimeh area, Jordan, using environmental isotope techniques (2006) Hydrogeol J, 14, pp. 180-191; Bonacci, O., Analyses of maximum discharge of karst springs (2001) Hydrogeol J, pp. 328-338; Clark, I., Fritz, P., (1997) Environmental Isotopes in Hydrogeology, p. 328. , Lewis Publishers, Boca Raton, FL; Cook, P.G., Herczeg, A.L., McEvan, K.L., (2001) Groundwater Recharge and Stream Base Flow, Atherton Tablelands, Queensland, , CSIRO Land Water Tech Rep 08/01, CISRO, Clayton South, Australia; Cyranoski, D., Conflicts undermine global forums push for safe water (2003) Nature, 422 (364), pp. 251-256; Eriksson, E., Khunakasem, V., Chloride concentration in groundwater, recharge rate and rate of deposition of chloride in the Israel Coastal Plain (1969) J Hydrol, 7, pp. 178-197; Gergan, J.T., Dobhal, D.P., Kaushik, R., Ground penetrating radar ice thickness measurements of Dokriani Bamak Glacier, Garhwal Himalayas (1999) Curr Sci, 77 (1), pp. 169-173; Geology and mineral resources of states of India, part X: Jammu and Kashmir State (1977) Geol.
