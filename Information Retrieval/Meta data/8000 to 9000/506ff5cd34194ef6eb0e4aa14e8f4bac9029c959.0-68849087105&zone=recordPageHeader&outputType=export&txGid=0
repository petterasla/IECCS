The OTC enhanced the mean air temperature by 2.9°C throughout the growing season. In contrast, only a slight difference (0.4°C) in the mean soil temperature was observed in the OTC compared with the control plots (CP). Spiraea mongolica, Potentilla fruticosa, Conicera hispida (deciduous shrubs) and Daphne retusa (evergreen shrub) showed earlier bud break, flowering and fruit coloring as well as longer flower longevity in the OTC than in the CP. All deciduous shrubs in the OTC had a longer leaf lifespan. Daphne retusa had higher leaf survival rates in the OTC. No significant differences in the total number of flowers and fruits were noticed for most species between the two treatments. Warming stimulated the shoot and leaf growth for most species. The specific leaf area tended to increase for many species in the OTC. However, the leaf nitrogen concentration tended to decrease in P. fruticosa and S. mongolica. The results obtained in the present study indicate that warming conditions can have strong impacts on alpine shrubs in a timberline ecotone. © 2009 The Society for the Study of Species Biology.","Alpine shrubs; Eastern Tibetan Plateau; Open-top chamber; Timberline ecotone; Warming effects","Conicera; Daphne; Potentilla; Potentilla fruticosa; Retusa; Spiraea",,,,,,"Ackerly, D.D., Self-shading, carbon gain and leaf dynamics: A test of alternative optimality models (1999) Oecologia, 119, pp. 300-310; Arft, A.M., Walker, M.D., Gurevitch, J., Alatalo, J.M., Bret-Harte, M.S., Dale, M., Diemer, M., Wookey, P.M., Responses of tundra plants to experimental warming: Meta-analysis of the international tundra experiment (1999) Ecological Monographs, 69, pp. 491-511; Baker, W.L., Hongaker, J.J., Weisberg, P.J., Using aerial photography and GIS to map the forest-tundra ecotone in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, for global change research (1995) Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing, 61, pp. 313-320; Berry, J., Björkman, O., Photosynthetic response and adaptation to temperature in higher mountain plants (1980) Annual Review of Plant Physiology, 31, pp. 491-643; Chapin, III.F.S., Shaver, G.R., Individualistic growth response of tundra plant species to environmental manipulations in the field (1985) Ecology, 66, pp. 564-576; Chapin, III.F.S., Shaver, G.R., Physiological and growth responses of arctic plants to a field experiment simulating climate change (1996) Ecology, 77, pp. 822-840; Chapin, III.F.S., Shaver, G.S., Giblin, A.E., Nadelhofer, K.J., Laundre, J.A., Responses of arctic tundra to experimental and observed changes in climate (1995) Ecology, 76, pp. 694-711; Grabherr, G., Gottfried, M., Pauli, H., Climate effects of mountain plants (1994) Nature, 369, pp. 448-450; Gugerli, F., Bauert, M.R., Growth and reproduction of Polygonum viviparum show weak responses to experimentally increased temperature at a Swiss alpine site (2001) Botanica Helvetica, 111, pp. 169-180; Havström, M., Callaghan, T.V., Jonasson, S., Differential growth responses of Cassiope tetragona, an arctic dwarf-shrub, to environmental perturbations among three contrasting high and sub-arctic sites (1993) Oikos, 66, pp. 389-402; Henry, G.H.R., Molau, U., Tundra plants and climate change: The International Tundra Experiment (ITEX) (1997) Global Change Biology, 3, pp. 1-9; (2007) Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability.
