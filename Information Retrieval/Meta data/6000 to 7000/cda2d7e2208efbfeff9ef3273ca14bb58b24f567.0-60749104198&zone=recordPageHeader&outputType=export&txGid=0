This is inconsistent with the changes in the equatorial atmosphere, which shows a slowdown of the zonal Walker circulation and tends to stabilize the tropical coupling system. The ocean role is highlighted in this paper. The enhanced ENSO variability is attributed to the strengthened equatorial thermocline that acts as a destabilizing factor of the tropical coupling system. To quantify the dynamic effect of the ocean on the ENSO variability under the global warming, ensemble experiments are performed using a coupled climate model [Fast Ocean Atmosphere Model (FOAM)], following the ""1pctto2x"" scenario defined in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports. Term balance analyses on the temperature variability equation show that the anomalous upwelling of the mean vertical temperature gradient (referred as the ""local term"") in the eastern equatorial Pacific is the most important destabilizing factor to the temperature variabilities. The magnitude of local term and its change are controlled by its two components: the mean vertical temperature gradient T̄z and the ""virtual vertical heat flux"" - w'T'. The former can be viewed as the background of the latter and these two components are positively correlated. A stronger T̄z is usually associated with a bigger upward heat flux - w'T', which implies a bigger impact of thermocline depth variations on SST. The T̄z is first enhanced during the transient stage of the global warming with a 1% yr-1 increase of CO2, and then reduced during the equilibrium stage with a fixed doubled CO2. This turnaround in T̄z determines the turnaround of ENSO variability in the entire global warming period. © 2008 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric pressure; Climatology; Global warming; Heat flux; Nickel compounds; Oceanography; Stream flow; Temperature sensors; Thermal gradients; Tropics; Balance analysis; Coupled climate models; Coupling systems; Dynamic effects; Eastern equatorial Pacific; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Local terms; Long-term trends; Ocean-atmosphere models; Southern oscillations; Temperature variabilities; Thermocline depths; Transient stages; Two components; Vertical temperature gradients; Walker circulations; Ocean engineering; atmosphere-ocean coupling; climate variation; decadal variation; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; equatorial dynamics; global warming; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; temperature gradient; trend analysis; upwelling; Walker circulation",,,,,,"An, S.-I., Kug, J.-S., Ham, Y.-G., Kang, I.-S., Successive modulation of ENSO to the future greenhouse warming (2008) J.
