The amounts of methane (CH4) that they produced were compiled and stratified with regard to various performances, dietary nutrient composition and nutrition levels. With increasing food intake and performance, an increase of CH4 emission per animal was observed. However, with increasing performance, a strong decrease of CH4 production per unit of product was determined. Altogether, the 12.74 million cattle in Germany produce 1.04 million tons of CH4 per year. This represents 1.25% of the CH4 production of the 1.3 thousand million (UK)/billion (US) cattle in the world or 0.22% of the total emission on the earth. As a greenhouse gas, CH4 from cattle worldwide and from cattle in Germany account for 3.5% and 0.04% of global warming, respectively. In addition, opportunities for a further reduction of enteric CH4 release are discussed. © Research Institute for the Biology of Farm Animals (FBN) Dummerstorf, Germany.","Cattle; CH4 production; Food intake; Performance level","Animalia; Bos",,,,,,"Arbeitsgemeinschaft Deutscher Rinderzüchter (ADR) (2008) Cattle production in Germany, Issue 2008 [in German]Brouwer E (1965) Report of subcommittee on constants and factors.
