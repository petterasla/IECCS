By the end of the 21st century, global mean sea level could stand 30-110 cm higher than in 1990. Those projections suggest that sea level could rise between 3 and 10 cm per decade during the next century. This is a marked acceleration over the increase of 1-2 cm per decade observed during the past century. How will local governments and citizens respond? What are the obstacles to local government and public cognition of, and response to, sea-level rise? This paper reviews some of the basic issues involved in responding to accelerated sea-level rise; the range of possible policy responses; the extent to which local governments and the public perceive and respond to threats of sea-level rise; and the need for research into the determinants of cognition and response. © ASCE.",,"Coastal Engineering; Environmental Engineering--Public Policy; Environmental Protection; Flood Control; Meteorology--Climatology; Global Warming; Local Government; Public Response; Oceanography",,,,,,"Bird, C.F., (1985) Coastline changes: A global review, , John Wiley and Sons, New York, N.Y; Burby, R.J., French, S.P., Coping with floods: The land use management paradox (1981) J.
