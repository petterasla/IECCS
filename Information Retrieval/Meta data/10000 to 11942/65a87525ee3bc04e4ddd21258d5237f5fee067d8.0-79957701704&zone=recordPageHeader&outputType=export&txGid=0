Therefore, efficient supply and use of energy are indispensable. We have proposed distributed energy management systems (DEMS), which are intended to obtain optimal plans that minimize both costs and CO2 emissions by electrical and thermal trading. In this paper we evaluate trading methods for the DEMS through computational experiments. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","CO2 emissions; distributed energy management system; market-oriented programming; multiagents","CO<sub>2</sub> emissions; Computational experiment; Distributed energies; Market oriented programming; Multi agent; Optimal plan; Carbon dioxide; Energy management; Global warming; Management; Multi agent systems; Commerce",,,,,,"Miyamoto, T., Kitayama, H., Kumagai, S., Mori, K., Kitamura, S., Shindo, S., An energy trading system with consideration of CO2 emissions (2008) Electr Eng Japan, p. 1624; Yakire, K., Miyamoto, T., Kumagai, S., Mori, K., Kitamura, S., Yamamoto, T., An application of the market-oriented programming to energy trading decision method in distributed energy management systems (2008) IEEJ Trans EIS, 128 C, pp. 24-31. , (in Japanese); Wellman, M.P., A market-oriented programming environment and its application to distributed multi-commodity flow problems (1993) J Artif Intell Res, 1, pp. 1-23; Ishida, A., Katagiri, Y., Kuwabara, K., Bunsan Jinko Chino (Distributed artificial intelligence) (1996) Corona Publishing; Ito, K., Yokoyama, R., Kogenereshon no Saiteki Keikaku (Optimal planning of cogeneration) (1990) Sangyo Tosho","Yakire, K.; Osaka UniversityJapan",,,,,,,,19429533,,,,"English","Elec.
