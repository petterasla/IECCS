This paper describes how the environmental effect of vehicles should be defined and includes parameters concerning vehicle emissions and their influence on human well-being and the environment. It then describes how the environmental effect of vehicles could be defined, taking into account the availability of accurate and reliable data. Rating systems are analysed as a means of comparing the environmental effect of vehicles, allowing decision-makers to dedicate their financial and non-financial policies and measures as a function of the ecological damage. Different types of pollution (acid rain, photochemical air pollution, noise pollution, etc.) and their effect on numerous receptors such as ecosystems, buildings and human beings (e.g. cancer, respiratory diseases, etc.) and global warming are considered. The methodology described, known as Ecoscore, is based on a methodology similar to life cycle assessment (LCA) which considers the part played by emissions in certain types of damage (e.g. by using the exposure-response damage function). Total emissions involve oil extraction, transport and refinery, fuel distribution and electricity generation and distribution (well-to-wheel approach). Emissions due to the production, use and dismantling of the vehicle (cradle-to-grave approach) should also be considered. The different types of damage are normalized to make comparisons possible. Hence, a reference value (determined by a chosen reference vehicle) will be defined as a target value (the normalized value will thus measure a kind of distance to target). The contribution of the different normalized types of damage to a single value - Ecoscore - is based on a panel weighting method. This new approach differs from other methodologies in that it has been especially developed for the assessment of the environmental effect of vehicle emissions in an urban context, such as the Brussels Capital Region. Additionally, this methodology not only considers conventional vehicles but can also evaluate all alternative fuels and drivetrains with new vehicle technologies. Some examples of Ecoscore calculation are illustrated.","Alternative fuel; Emissions; Environment; Modelling; Pollution; Primary energy; Vehicle technologies","Air pollution; Ecosystems; Electric drives; Environmental impact; Exhaust gases; Gas emissions; Global warming; Health hazards; Mathematical models; Synthetic fuels; Drivetrains; Environmental damage; Panel weighting method; Primary energy; Vehicle emissions; Ground vehicles",,,,,,"JOULE, externalities of fuel cycles 'ExternE' project (1995), European Commission, Directorate-General XII, Science, Research and Development; Report 2, Methodology, EUR16521, LuxembourgJOULE, externalities of fuel cycles 'ExternE' project (1998), European Commission, Directorate-General XII, Science, Research and Development; Report 7, Methodology, 1998 update EUR16521, LuxembourgFavrel, V., Pons, T., Maréchal, K., Claeys, P., Ferdinand, C., Hecq, W., Mobilité durable en Région bruxelloise: Analyse des impacts sur l'environnement - Evaluation des externalités physiques et monétaires (2001), Final report, SSTC MDDD012, Centre d'Etudes Economiques et Sociales de l'Environnement, Université Libre de Bruxelles, AugustPicque, Ch., (1999), Minister-President, Article 22 of the Ordinance of 25 March 1999 of the Brussels Capital Region concerning the evaluation and improvement of the quality of the air (published in the Official Journal 24 June)Van Mierlo, J., Van De Burgwal, E., Invloed van het rijgedrag op de verkeersemissies: Kwantificatie en maatregelen (2002), Vrije Universiteit Brussel, TNO, AMINAL project(1999) Auto-Umweltliste 1999/2000, , (VCD, Bonn); DeCicco, J., Thomas, M., Kliesch, J., (2000) ACEEE's Green Book, , (ACEEE, Washington); Govaerts, L., Emissielabelling nieuwe personenwagens VITO, report AMINAL projectGoedkoop, M., The eco-indicator 95, weighting method for environmental effects that damage ecosystems or human health on a European scale (1996), p. 86. , Final report, PR'e ConsultantsGoedkoop, M., Spriensma, R., The eco-indicator 99, a damage oriented method for life cycle impact assessment, methodology report (2000) PRé Consultants, 2nd Edition, p. 130; Hill, N., Haydock, H., Saynor, B., Cleaner drive - Development of an EU environmental rating methodology (2002), http://www.cleaner-drive.com/, AEA Technology, UK, JulyKeller, M., De Haan, P., Intermodal comparisons of atmospheric pollutant emissions (1998), MEET project, Deliverable 24, EC Contract ST-96-SC.204, INFRAS, Berne, Switzerland, OctoberJoumard, R., Methods of estimation of atmospheric emissions from transport: European scientist network and scientific state-of-the-art (1999), Final report, LTE 9901 report, action COST 319, Institut National Recherche sur les Transports et leur Séureité (INRETS), France, Marchhttp://www.vca.gov.uk/, Vehicle Certification Agency database(2001), Cleaner vehicles in cities.
