It is shown that the geological structure of the inner and outer zones of the Okhotsk-Chukotka volcanogenic belts is a decisive factor in determining the permafrost and hydrogeological conditions in the coastal zone against the background of the uniform climatic conditions along the entire coast. The inner zone of the belt is characterized by the most favorable conditions for the intense water exchange. The regional deep drainage during the Late Pleistocene Cryochron, the subsequent global warming, and the transgression of the Sea of Okhotsk in the initial Holocene were responsible for the formation of the hydrogeochemical zoning in the sedimentary cover of the artesian basins and development of the zone of fracture and fracture-vein chloride brackish and saline waters in the coastal hydrogeological structures. New data indicating the geoecological significance of the defined regularities are presented. © MAIK Nauka 2008.","Coastal zone; Geoecology; Groundwaters; Permafrost rocks; Sea of Okhotsk",,,,,,,"Anderson, P.M., Lozhkin, A.V., (2002) Late Quaternary Plants and Climates of Siberia and Far East (Palinological and Radiocarbon Data Base), , (Severovost.
