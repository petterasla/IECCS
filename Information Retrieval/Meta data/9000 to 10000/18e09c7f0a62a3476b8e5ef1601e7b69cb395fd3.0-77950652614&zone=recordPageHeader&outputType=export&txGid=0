This study provides a life-cycle assessment for digital logic chips over seven technology generations, spanning from 1995 through 2010. Environmental indicators include global warming potential, acidification, eutrophication, ground-level ozone (smog) formation, potential human cancer and non-cancer health effects, ecotoxicity and water use. While impacts per device area related to fabrication infrastructure and use-phase electricity have increased steadily, those due to transportation and fabrication direct emissions have fallen as a result of changes in process technology, device and wafer sizes and yields over the generations. Electricity, particularly in the use phase, and direct emissions from fabrication are the most important contributors to life-cycle impacts. Despite the large quantities of water used in fabrication, across the life cycle, the largest fraction of water is consumed in generation of electricity for use-phase power. Reducing power consumption in the use phase is the most effective way to limit impacts, particularly for the more recent generations of logic. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Electronics; Information technology; Life-cycle assessment; Life-cycle inventory; Semiconductors","Diseases; Electricity; Electronic equipment; Energy efficiency; Eutrophication; Fabrication; Global warming; Information technology; Logic programming; Semiconductor materials; Water supply; Computational logic; Environmental indicators; Global warming potential; Ground-level ozone; Human health impacts; In-process technology; Life Cycle Inventory; Life-cycle assessments; Life cycle",,,,,,"Tekwawa, M., Miyamoto, S., Inaba, A., Life cycle assessment; An approach to environmentally friendly PCs (1997) Proc.
