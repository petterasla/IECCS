Using data from Germany (1951-2003) and Slovenia (1961-2004), we study whether changes in the start, end, and length of the growing season differ among four deciduous broad-leaved tree species and countries, how the changes are related to temperature changes, and what might be the confounding effects of an insect attack. The functional behaviour of the phenological and climatological time series and their trends are not analysed by linear regression, but by a new Bayesian approach taking into account different models for the functional description (one change-point, linear, constant models). We find advanced leaf unfolding in both countries with the same species order (oak &gt; horse chestnut, beech, and birch). However, this advance is non linear over time and more apparent in Germany with clear change-points in the late 1970s, followed by marked advances (on average 3.67 days decade-1 in the 2000s). In Slovenia, we find a more gradual advance of onset dates (on average 0.8 days decade-1 in the 2000s). Leaf colouring of birch, beech, and oak has been slightly delayed in the last 3 decades, especially in Germany, however with no clear functional behaviour. Abrupt changes in leaf colouring dates of horse chestnut with recent advancing onset dates can be linked across countries to damage by a newly emerging pest, the horse chestnut leaf-miner (Cameraria ohridella). The lengthening of the growing season, more distinct in Germany than in Slovenia (on average 4.2 and 1.0 days decade-1 in the 2000s, respectively), exhibits the same species order in both countries (oak &gt; birch &gt; beech). Damage by horse chestnut leaf-miner leads to reduced lengthening (Germany) and drastic shortening (Slovenia) of the horse chestnut growing season (-12 days decade-1 in the 2000s). Advanced spring leaf unfolding and lengthening of the growing season of oak, beech and birch are highly significantly related to increasing March temperatures in both countries. Only beech and oak leaf unfolding in Germany, which is generally observed later in the year than that of the other two species, is more closely correlated with April temperatures, which comparably exhibit marked change-points at the end of the 1970s. © 2007 ISB.","Bayes; Cameraria ohridella; Deciduous broad-leaved species; Global warming; Growing season; Phenology; Temperature","animal; article; Bayes theorem; biological model; biometry; classification; computer simulation; ecosystem; Germany; growth, development and aging; Lepidoptera; methodology; parasitology; physiology; season; Slovenia; species difference; statistical analysis; tree; Animals; Bayes Theorem; Biometry; Computer Simulation; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Ecosystem; Germany; Lepidoptera; Models, Biological; Seasons; Slovenia; Species Specificity; Trees; Aesculus; Aesculus hippocastanum; Agromyzidae; Cameraria ohridella; Fagus; Hexapoda",,,,,,"(2003) Navodila Za Fenološka Opazovanja, p. 51. , ARSO; Defila, C., Clot, B., Phytophenological trends in the Swiss Alps, 1951-2002 (2005) Meteorol Z, 14, pp. 191-196. , 2; Deschka, G., Dimic, N., Cameraria ohridella n. sp. aus Mazedonien, Jugoslawien (Lepidoptera, Lithocelletidae) (1986) Acta Ent Jugosl, 22 (1), pp. 11-23; Dose, V., Menzel, A., Bayesian analysis of climate change impacts in phenology (2004) Global Change Biology, 10, pp. 259-272; Anleitung für die phänologischen Beobachter des Deutschen Wetterdienstes (1991) Vorschriften und Betriebsunterlagen, 17. , DWD Deutscher Wetterdienst, Offenbach am Main; Fitzjarrald, D.R., Acevedo, O.C., Moore, K.E., Climatic consequences of leaf presence in the eastern United States (2001) J Climate, 14, pp. 598-613; Gilbert, M., Grégoire, J.C., Freise, J.F., Heitland, W., Long-distance dispersal and human population density allow the prediction of invasive patterns in the horse chestnut leafminer Cameraria ohridella (2004) J Anim Ecol, 73, pp. 459-468; Heitland, W., Freise, J., Verbreitung der Roßkastanien-Miniermotte, Cameraria ohridella (Lep., Gracillariidae) in Deutschland.
