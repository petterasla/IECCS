In order to assess the effect of increased seawater temperature on a temperate coastal ecosystem, we studied the inter-annual variation in productivity of Laminaria japonica using long-term oceanographic observations for the Uwa Sea, southern Japan. The annual productivity estimates for L. japonica were 2.7±2.5 (mean±SD) kg wet wt. m-1 (length of rope) (2003/2004), 1.0±0.6 kg wet wt. m-1 (2004/2005) and 12.1±12.5 kg wet wt. m-1 (2005/2006). Our previous study using the same methodology at the same locality reported that the productivity was estimated for the 2001/2002 (33.3±15.2 kg wet wt. m-1) and 2002/2003 (34.0±8.7 kg wet wt. m-1) seasons. Productivity in 2003/2004 and 2004/2005 was significantly lower than in years 2001/2002, 2002/2003 and 2005/2006. A comparison of oceanographic conditions among the 5 years revealed the presence of threshold seawater temperature effects. When the average seawater temperature during the first 45 days of each experiment exceeded 15.5°C, productivity was reduced to about 10 % of that in cooler years. Moreover the analysis of growth and erosion rates indicates that when the seawater temperature was over 17.5°C, erosion rate exceeded growth rate. Thus, an increase of seawater temperature of just 1°C during winter drastically reduces the productivity of L. japonica in the Uwa Sea. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Global warming; Laminaria japonica; Productivity; Seawater temperature; Uwa Sea","Anthozoa; Laminaria; Laminaria japonica",,,,,,"Coles, S.L., Brown, B.E., Coral bleaching-capacity for acclimatization and adaptation (2003) Adv Mar Biol, 46, pp. 183-223; Hasegawa, M., Koizumi, K., Konagaya, T., Noda, M., Grazing of herbivorous fish as a continuous factor of Isoyake off the coast of Hainan, Shizuoka Prefecture (2003) Bull Shizuoka Pref Fish Exp Stn, 38, pp. 19-25; Hiraoka, M., Ura, Y., Haraguchi, H., Relationship between seaweed beds and seawater temperature in the Tosa Bay (2005) Aquabiology, 27, pp. 485-493. , 5; Hoegh-Guldberg, O., Salvat, B., Periodic mass-bleaching and elevated sea temperatures: Bleaching of outer reef slope communities in Moorea, French Polynesia (1995) Mar Ecol Prog Ser, 121, pp. 181-190; (2001) Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis, p. 881. , IPCC.
