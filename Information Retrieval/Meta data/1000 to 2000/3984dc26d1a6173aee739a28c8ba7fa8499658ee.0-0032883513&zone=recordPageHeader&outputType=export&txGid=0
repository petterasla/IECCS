Among measures considered to curtail automobile dependency and increase transit modal split, ""full cost pricing"" -a means of extracting both environmental costs and hidden subsidies which road users allegedly impose on society -has emerged as an increasingly popular suggestion. This paper examines the potential impact of full cost pricing on the ""sustainability"" of urban transportation, using Toronto as a case study. The analysis deals with the direct effects on mode choice and vehicle utilization resulting from increased user costs as might be achieved through fuel taxes or road pricing, as well as the indirect, longer term effects on location decisions. To investigate the land-use impacts, population distributions were altered to reflect more compact development and less urban sprawl as a proxy for relocations that might result from an increase in the costs of automobile use. Impacts are presented in terms of changes in total peak period vehicle-kilometres, mode split, and CO2 emissions. Despite several qualifications related to modelling techniques used in the case study, the analysis suggests that, overall, the impacts of large increases in road user costs appear to be less than proponents of full cost pricing would expect. In addition, the analysis suggests the fairly obvious, namely, that the greatest impacts of pricing occur within those choice markets where reasonable alternatives to the private automobile actually exist. © 1999 NRC.","Emissions; Full cost pricing; Road pricing; Sustainable transportation; Urban transportation","Carbon dioxide; Costs; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Particulate emissions; Cost pricing; Sustainable transportation; Urban transportation; Transportation; cost; Economics; Global warming; Sustainability; transport; urban area",,,,,,"(1997) Designing Economic Instruments to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions in North America, , Ottawa, Ont; (1997) Small Sports Utility Vehicles, , Consumer's Union, Yonkers, New York.
