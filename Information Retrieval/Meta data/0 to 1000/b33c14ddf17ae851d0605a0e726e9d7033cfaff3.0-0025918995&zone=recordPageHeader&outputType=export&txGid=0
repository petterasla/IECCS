Changes in forestland areas and biomass are playing a role in the accumulation. This paper reviews and offers some observations on estimates of the role of forests in the carbon cycle. The temperate forests are roughly in carbon balance, with biomass growth equaling or exceeding losses. The tropical forests, by contrast, are a carbon source with forest area declining due primarily to land-use changes. A number of carbon-sequestering sources, such as wood construction and landfills, may be sequestering more carbon than is commonly assumed. Climate change can also affect forests. A number of mechanisms that influence forest growth and composition are discussed. In the absence of increased precipitation and/or a CO2 ""fertilization"" effect, warming is likely to diminish forest area and biomass. Forest burning is part of the natural cycle. During a burn, carbon is released through the post-burning period and typically involves carbon sequestering as the result of regeneration and vigorous growth. In an undisturbed natural system, a steady-state level of global forest biomass would be reached. Anthropogenic factors can upset the natural steady state. In a period of rapid climate transition, such as might accompany a global warming, forests are likely to lose vigor and thus be particularly susceptible to wildfire. © 1991.",,"carbon dioxide; climate; ecology; fire; forest; meteorology; review; united states; climatic change; fire; forest; North America",,,,,,"Armentano, Ralston, The role of temperate zone forests in the world carbon cycle (1980) Canadian Journal of Forest Research, 10, pp. 53-60; Davis, Climatic instability, time lags, and community disequilibrium (1986) Community Biology, pp. 269-284. , J.
