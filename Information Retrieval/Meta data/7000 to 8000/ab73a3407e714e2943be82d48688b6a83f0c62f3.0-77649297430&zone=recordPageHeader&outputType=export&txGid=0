Modern software tools give the possibility of generating many development scenarios of transport system, which can be tested quickly. Transportation models represent a good (and necessary) basis in the procedure of environmental traffic impacts and energy emission estimation. Research in this paper deals with the possibility of using transportation modeling as a tool for estimation of some air pollution and global warming indicators on street network, produced by personal cars with internal combustion engines. These indicators could be the basis for defining planning and management solutions for transport system with respect to their environmental impacts. All the analyses are based on several years of research experience in Belgrade. According to the emissions of gases from the model, the values of other green house gases can be estimated using the known relations between the pollutants. There is a possibility that all these data can be used to calculate the transportation systems impact on temperature increase in urban areas.","Demand modeling on street network; Energy emission estimation; Environmental impacts of transport; Pollution estimation",,,,,,,"Vuchic, V., (2003), ***, Master plan of Belgrade 2021 (in Serbian), Urban Planing Institute of Belgrade, BelgradeVuchic, V., (2007) Urban Transit System and Technology, , John Wiley & Sons, Hoboken, N.
