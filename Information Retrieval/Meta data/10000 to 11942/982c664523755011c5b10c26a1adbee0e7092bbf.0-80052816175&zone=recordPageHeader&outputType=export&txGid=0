It reveals that the recent change in zonal-mean surface air temperature is positive at practically all latitudes. In the Northern Hemisphere, the warming increases with increasing latitude and is large in the Arctic Ocean during much of the year except in summer, when it is small. At the Antarctic coast and in the northern part of the circumpolar ocean (near 55°S), where limited data are available, the changes appear to be small during most seasons, though the warming is notable at the coast in winter. However, this warming is much less than the warming over the Arctic Ocean. The seasonal variation of the surface temperature change appears to be broadly consistent with the result from a global warming experiment that was conducted some time ago using a coupled atmosphere-ocean-land model. © 2011 American Meteorological Society.",,"Antarctic coasts; Arctic ocean; Climatic research; Coupled atmosphere-ocean-land model; Data sets; Latitudinal profiles; Limited data; Northern Hemispheres; Seasonal variation; Surface air temperatures; Surface temperature changes; Surface temperatures; United kingdom; Data processing; Global warming; Oceanography; Surface properties; Atmospheric temperature; air temperature; global warming; Northern Hemisphere; seasonal variation; surface temperature; Antarctica; Arctic Ocean",,,,,,"Berrisford, P., Dee, D.P., Fielding, K., Fuentes, M., Kållberg, P., Kobayashi, S., Uppala, S.M., TheERA-Interim archive, version 1.0.
