For each site, a number of probability distributions were tested for goodness-of-fit to 1961-87 observed daily maximum and minimum temperature data using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The parameters of the best-fitting distributions were then perturbed to take into account climate change, both mean and variability. Probabilities of the occurrence of particular temperature threshold events were calculated for both present and future climates. Results presented for two contrasting sites illustrate the importance of including changes in variability in climate change studies. -from Authors",,"anthropogenic emission modelling; daily temperature extreme; global warming; greenhouse gas; probability distribution; UK",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029667208
