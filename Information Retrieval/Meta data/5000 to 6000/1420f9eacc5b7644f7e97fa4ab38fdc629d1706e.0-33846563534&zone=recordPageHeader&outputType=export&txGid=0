However, the mechanisms of its effects remain unclear. A laboratory study in 1980-1981 in which temperate zone amphibians that were prevented from hibernating had decreased growth rates, matured at a smaller size and had increased mortality compared with those that hibernated suggested one possible mechanism. I used data from a field study of common toads (Bufo bufo) in the UK, between 1983 and 2005, to determine whether this also occurs in the field. The results demonstrated two pathways by which global warming may cause amphibian declines. First, there was a clear relationship between a decline in the body condition of female common toads and the occurrence of warmer than average years since 1983. This was paralleled by a decline in their annual survival rates with the relationship between these two declines being highly correlated. Second, there was a significant relationship between the occurrence of mild winters and a reduction in female body size, resulting in fewer eggs being laid annually. Climate warming can, therefore, act on wild temperate zone amphibians by deleteriously affecting their physiology, during and after hibernation, causing increased female mortality rates and decreased fecundity in survivors. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.","Body size; Bufo bufo; Environmental temperatures; Hibernation; Mortality","body condition; body size; climate change; environmental effect; global warming; growth rate; hibernation; mortality; physiology; population decline; survival; survivorship; temperate environment; toad; animal; article; body constitution; climate; comparative study; female; greenhouse effect; longitudinal study; physiology; population density; population dynamics; survival; toad; United Kingdom; Animals; Body Constitution; Bufo bufo; Climate; England; Female; Greenhouse Effect; Longitudinal Studies; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Survival Analysis; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe; Amphibia; Anura; Bufo bufo",,,,,,"Alexander, M.A., Eischeid, J.K., Climate variability in regions of amphibian declines (2001) Conserv Biol, 15, pp. 930-942; Beebee, T.J.C., Amphibian breeding and climate (1995) Nature, 374, pp. 219-220; Beebee, T.J.C., Griffiths, R.A., The amphibian decline crisis: A watershed for conservation biology?
