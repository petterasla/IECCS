Over half of the global annual net primary production was estimated to occur in the tropics, with most of the production attributable to tropical evergreen forest. The effects of CO2 doubling and associated climate changes were also explored. The responses in tropical and dry temperate ecosystems were j dominated by CO2, but those in northern and moist temperate ecosystems reflected the effects of temperature on nitrogen availability.",,"carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide enrichment; climatic change; global climate change; net primary production; nitrogen cycling; primary production; process based modelling; tropics",,,,,,,"Melillo, J.M.; Ecosystems Center, Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, MA 02543, United States",,,,,,,,00280836,,NATUA,,"English","Nature",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027470607
