In recent years, the automotive industry has been experiencing an increasing concern with environmental requirements. A particular focus is being given to light-weighting of cars, to reducing fuel consumption and to the use of different recycling materials. Consequently, decisions on product design and development must involve economic and technological as well as environmental considerations. In adequate conditions, the LCA methodology enables one to assist an effective integration of the environmental considerations in the decision-making process [1]. In this paper, a multi-material car component which is part of the current automotive brake system, has been modified by its original manufacturer. Such a modification included the use of a new multi-material injection moulding process and the consumption of recyclable materials. The new and the current component were comparatively assessed throughout their life cycles in order to evaluate their respective environmental impacts and, thus, to verify if the new component offers a lower environmental load. The results described in this paper are part of the outcome of a broader research project involving industrial companies, university, technological centres and research institutes based in Portugal, Spain and Germany. Main Features. The car component under focus has four subcomponents whose base materials consist of steel and plastic. The LCA methodology is used to evaluate two scenarios describing the new car component, on the one hand, and the reference scenario, which consists of the existing car component, on the other. The former results from the selection of new subcomponents materials, aiming to use a new production process together with a recycling strategy. Results and Discussion. The inventory analysis shows a lower energy consumption in the alternative scenario (4.2 MJ) compared to the reference scenario (6.1 MJ). Most of that energy is still non-renewable, relating in particular to crude consumption in the car use phase and in the production phase (transports and plastics production). The life cycle inventory analysis indicates also that the alternative scenario has lower air emissions of CO<inf>2</inf>, CO, NO<inf>x</inf>, SO<inf>x</inf>, NM VOC and PM10, as well as lower solid wastes and water emissions of oils and BOD5. Otherwise, the water emissions of undissolved substances and COD are higher for the alternative scenario. Most of the energy consumed and the air pollutants inventoried occur as a consequence of the use phase. Otherwise, for most of the life cycle water emissions inventoried and solid wastes, the production phase is the major contributor. The impact assessment, performed with the CML method, allows one to conclude that the alternative scenario exhibits lower results in all the impact categories. Both scenarios have similar environmental profiles, being: (i) the use phase, the major contributor for the abiotic depletion, global warming, photochemical oxidation, acidification and eutrophication; and (ii) the production phase, the main contributor for ozone depletion, human toxicity, fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity, marine aquatic ecotoxicity and terrestrial ecotoxicity. The sensitivity analysis, with respect to the fuel consumption reduction value, the impact assessment method and the final disposal scenario, performed in this study allows one to confirm, as a main conclusion, that the alternative scenario is environmentally preferable to the reference scenario. Conclusion. The results obtained through the application of the LCA methodology enable one to conclude that the alternative component has a lower environmental load than the reference component. Recommendations and Perspectives. Considering that the time required for the inventory data collection is a critical issue in LCA practise, the insights provided by this particular case study are likely to be useful to product developers in the car component manufacturing industry, particularly to brake system manufacturers supporting the environmental design within the sector. © 2007 ecomed publishers (Verlagsgruppe Hüthig Jehle Rehm GmbH).","Automotive sector; Car components; CML method; Eco-indicator 99 method; LCA; Product development","acidification; air pollutant; article; car; ecotoxicity; energy consumption; environmental impact; eutrophication; greenhouse effect; life cycle assessment; photooxidation; priority journal; recycling; sensitivity analysis; solid waste; solid waste management",,,,,,"Curran, M.A., (1996) Environmental Life Cycle Assessment, , Mc Graw Hill; Keoleian, G., Spatari, S., Beal, R.T., Stephans, R.D., Williams, R.L., LCA Case Studies, Application of Life Cycle Inventory Analysis to Fuel Tank System Design (1998) Int J LCA, 3 (1), pp. 18-28; Keoleian, G.A., Kar, K., Elucidating complex design and management tradeoffs through life cycle design: Air intake manifold demonstration project (2003) J Cl Prod, pp. 61-77; International Organization for Standards (ISO) (1997): Environmental management - Life cycle assessment - Principles and framework.
