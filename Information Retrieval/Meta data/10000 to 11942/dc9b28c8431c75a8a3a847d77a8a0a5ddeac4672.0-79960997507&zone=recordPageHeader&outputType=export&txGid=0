Among the other exhaust gases, PFCs have longer residual time in air and higher global warming potential. To remove PFCs, water jet gliding arc plasma was designed and prepared. Water jet gliding arc plasma has received the attention as a PFCs decomposition technique due to the formation of OH radical and wide range of plasma. Using water jet gliding arc plasma, the efficacy on the decomposition of CF4, one of the major PFCs, was evaluated. As the results of experiments, the amount of water jet increases the decomposition efficiency of CF4. From the experimental results, a combination of plasma and water jet is considered to be effective for the decomposition of CF4. Regarding the parametric researches, input feed of water jet, input concentration change, variation in input power, electrode gap, and electrode length were selected for experiments. The highest decomposition efficiency of CF4 was achieved with 2.1% of input concentration, 7200 kJ/m3 of specific energy input (SEI), 1.53×10-4 m3/s of total gas amount, and 4.25×10-7 m3/s of water jet feed. © 2011 The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","CF4 destruction; Gliding arc discharge; Greenhouse gas; Water jet scrubber","Chemical vapor deposition process; Concentration change; Decomposition efficiency; Decomposition technique; Electrode gap; Electrode lengths; Gliding arc; Gliding arc discharge; Global warming potential; Input power; OH radical; Perfluorocarbons; Residual time; Semiconductor manufacturing; Specific energy input; Water jet scrubber; Water jets; Chemical vapor deposition; Electric discharges; Exhaust gases; Experiments; Free radicals; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Jets; Plasma deposition; Plasma etching; Plasmas; Semiconductor device manufacture; Water vapor",,,,,,"Frank-Kamenetskii, D.A., (1987) Diffusion and Heat Transfer in Chemical Kinetics, , Moscow, Russia: Nauka; Shebeko, Y.N., Azatyan, V.V., Bolodian, L.A., Navzenya, V.Y., Kopylov, S.N., Shebeko, D.Y., Zamishevski, E.D., The influence of fluorinated hydrocarbons on the combustion of gaseous mixtures in a closed vessel (2000) Combustion and Flame, 121, pp. 542-547; Narengerile, Saito, H., Watanabe, T., Decomposition of tetrafluoromethane by water plasma generated under atmospheric pressure (2009) Thin Solid Films, 518, pp. 929-935; Kim, D.Y., Park, D.W., Decomposition of PFCs by steam plasma at atmospheric pressure (2008) Surface and Coatings Technology, 202, pp. 5280-5283; Chae, J.O., Moon, S.I., Sun, H.S., Kim, K.Y., Vassiliev, V.A., Mikholap, E.M., A Study of Volatile Organic Compounds Decomposition with the Use of Non-Thermal Plasma (1999) KSME International Journal, 13 (9), pp. 647-655; Yu, S.J., Chang, M.B., Oxidative Conversion of PFC via Plasma Processing with Dielectric Barrier Discharges (2001) Plasma Chem.
