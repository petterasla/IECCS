These halocarbons are mainly used for refrigeration, air-conditioning, foam blowing, tobacco expansion, aerosol propulsion, solvent cleaning, and fire fighting. China ratified the Montreal Protocol in 1991 and has been implementing the phase-out of halocarbons since then. In this paper, the emissions of halocarbons from China were estimated for 1995-2024 based on the historical consumption, the country program for complying with the Montreal Protocol, and the sector plans for phasing out halocarbons. The results show that China's compliance with the Montreal Protocol contributes greatly to both ozone protection and climate protection. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
