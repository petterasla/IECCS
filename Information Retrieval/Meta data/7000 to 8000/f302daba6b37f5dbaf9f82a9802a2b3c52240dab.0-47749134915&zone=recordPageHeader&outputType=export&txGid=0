The interplay among individual actors, organizations, and institutions at multiple levels is central in such transitions. A flexible organization, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, was crucial in initiating the transition to ecosystem-based management. This agency was also instrumental in the subsequent transformation of the governance regime and provided leadership throughout the process. Strategies involved internal reorganization and management innovation, leading to an ability to coordinate the scientific community, to increase public awareness of environmental issues and problems, to involve a broader set of stakeholders, and to maneuver the political system for support at critical times. The transformation process was induced by increased pressure on the Great Barrier Reef (from terrestrial runoff, overharvesting, and global warming) that triggered a new sense of urgency to address these challenges. The focus of governance shifted from protection of selected individual reefs to stewardship of the larger-scale seascape. The study emphasizes the significance of stewardship that can change patterns of interactions among key actors and allow for new forms of management and governance to emerge in response to environmental change. This example illustrates that enabling legislations or other social bounds are essential, but not sufficient for shifting governance toward adaptive comanagement of complex marine ecosystems. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Adaptive governance; Ecosystem services; Transformation","Australia; awareness; coral reef; environmental change; environmental management; government regulation; greenhouse effect; political system; priority journal; review; Australia; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Marine Biology",,,,,,"Jackson, J.B.C., Historical overfishing and the recent collapse of coastal ecosystems (2001) Science, 293, pp. 629-638; Hughes, T.P., Climate change, human impacts, and the resilience of coral reefs (2003) Science, 301, pp. 929-933; Worm, B., Impacts of biodiversity loss on ocean ecosystem services (2006) Science, 314, pp. 787-790; Costanza, R., Principles for sustainable governance of the oceans (1998) Science, 281, pp. 198-199; Young, O.R., Solving the crisis in ocean governance: Place-based management of marine ecosystems (2007) Environment, 49, pp. 20-32; Ludwig, D., Hillborn, R., Walters, C., Uncertainty, resource exploitation, and conservation: Lessons from history (1993) Science, 260, pp. 17-36; Hughes, T.P., Bellwood, D.R., Folke, C., Steneck, R.S., Wilson, J., New paradigms for supporting the resilience of marine ecosystems (2005) Trends Ecol Evol, 20, pp. 380-386; Crowder, L.B., Resolving mismatches in U.S. ocean governance (2006) Science, 313, pp. 617-618; (2003) Navigating Social-Ecological Systems: Building Resilience for Complexity and Change, , Berkes F, Colding J, Folke C, eds , Cambridge Univ Press, Cambridge, UK; Wilson, J.A., Matching social and ecological systems in complex ocean fisheries (2006) Ecol Soc, 11, p. 9; Gunderson, L.H., Light, S.S., Adaptive management and adaptive governance in the Everglades ecosystem (2006) Policy Sci, 39, pp. 323-334; Ostrom, E., Going beyond panaceas Special Feature: A diagnostic approach for going beyond panaceas (2007) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 104, pp. 15181-15187; Naylor, R.L., Eagle, J., Smith, W.L., Salmon aquaculture in the Pacific Northwest: A global industry with local impacts (2003) Environment, 45, pp. 18-39; Berkes, F., Globalization, roving bandits, and marine resources (2006) Science, 311, pp. 1557-1558; Deutsch, L., Feeding aquaculture growth through globalization: Exploitation of marine ecosystems for fishmeal (2007) Glob Environ Change, 17, pp. 238-249; Folke, C., Pritchard, L., Berkes, F., Colding, J., Svedin, U., The problem of fit between ecosystems and institutions: Ten years later (2007) Ecol Soc, 12, p. 30; Brown, K., Integrating conservation and development: A case of institutional misfit (2003) Front Ecol Environ, 1, pp. 479-487; Galaz, V., Olsson, P., Hahn, T., Folke, C., Svedin, U., (2008) Institutions and Environmental Change: Principal Findings, Applications, and Research Frontiers, pp. 147-182. , eds Young OR, King LA, Schröder H MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, pp; Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005) Ecosystems and Human Well-Being: Synthesis (Island, Washington, DC)Babcock, E.A., Pikitch, E.K., Can we reach agreement on a standardized approach to ecosystem-based fishery management?
