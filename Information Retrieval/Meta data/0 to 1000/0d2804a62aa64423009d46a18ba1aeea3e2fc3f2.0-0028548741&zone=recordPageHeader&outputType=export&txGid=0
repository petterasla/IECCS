The initial thermal conductivity is higher than comparable CFC-11 standards. Aging characteristics are excellent, however, and at least equivalent to the CFC-11 standard. The use of pentane offers a long-term solution to the CFC problem.",,"Aging of materials; Blowing agents; Insulating materials; Laminates; Paraffins; Polyurethanes; Thermal conductivity; Pentane blown polyurethane foams; Rigid foamed plastics",,,,,,,"Lawler, L.F.; ARCO Chemical Co, South Charleston, United States",,,"Technomic Publ Co Inc, Lancaster, PA, United States",,,,,0021955X,,JCUPA,,"English","J Cell Plast",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028548741
