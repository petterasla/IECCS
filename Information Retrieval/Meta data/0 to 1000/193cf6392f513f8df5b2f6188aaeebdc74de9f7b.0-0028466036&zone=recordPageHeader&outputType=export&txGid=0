The one significant exception is a German study that utilized building energy models and determined that the increase in cooling would be somewhat larger, due to the effects of increased humidity with atmospheric warming. This study utilizes the DOE2 building energy model on a prototype commercial building and demonstrates that increased humidity could be a significant factor in total building energy use, particularly in the more humid parts of the United States. The study also demonstrates that the effect can be overcome with advanced building designs. © 1994 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Building energy use; Climate change; Global warming; Humidity; Modeling; United States","Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric temperature; Buildings; Climatology; Cooling; Electric power systems; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Mathematical models; Space heating; Statistical methods; Thermal effects; Climate change; Commercial building energy demand; Global warming; Electric power utilization",,,,,,"Aittoniemi, P., Influences of climatic change on the Finnish energy economy (1991) Energy and Environment 1991, , E.
