Such beach ""nourishment"" can bury shallow reefs and degrade other beach habitats, depressing nesting in sea turtles and reducing the densities of invertebrate prey for shorebirds, surf fishes, and crabs. Despite decades of agency-mandated monitoring at great expense, much uncertainty about the biological impacts of beach nourishment nonetheless exists. A review of 46 beach monitoring studies shows that (a) only 11 percent of the studies controlled for both natural spatial and temporal variation in their analyses, (b) 56 percent reached conclusions that were not adequately supported, and (c) 49 percent failed to meet publication standards for citation and synthesis of related work. Monitoring is typically conducted through project promoters, with no independent peer review, and the permitting agencies exhibit inadequate expertise to review biostatistical designs. Monitoring results are rarely used to scale mitigation to compensate for injured resources. Reform of agency practices is urgently needed as the risk of cumulative impacts grows. © 2005 American Institute of Biological Sciences.","Beach nourishment; Biological impacts; Monitoring; Public trust; Sampling design","Cheloniidae; Decapoda (Crustacea); Invertebrata; Pisces; Testudines",,,,,,"Barros, F., Underwood, A.J., Lindegarth, M., A preliminary analysis of the structure of benthic assemblages of surf zones on two morphodynamic types of beach (2002) Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom, 82, pp. 353-357; Barth, M.C., Titus, J.G., (1984) Greenhouse Effect and Sea Level Rise: A Challenge for This Generation, , New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold; Bender, E.A., Case, T.J., Gilpin, M.E., Perturbation experiments in community ecology: Theory and practice (1984) Ecology, 65, pp. 1-13; Brown, A.C., McLachlan, A., (1990) Ecology of Sandy Shores, , Amsterdam: Elsevier; Burlas, M., Ray, G.L., Clarke, D., (2001) The New York District's Biological Monitoring Program for the Atlantic Coast of New Jersey, Asbury Park to Manasquan Section Beach Erosion Control Project: Final Report, , Vicksburg (MS): US Army Corps of Engineers; Bush, D.M., Neal, W.J., Longo, N.J., Lindeman, K.C., Pilkey, D.F., Esteves, L.S., Congleton, J.D., Pilkey, O.H., (2004) Living with Florida's Atlantic Beaches: Coastal Hazards from Amelia Island to Key West, , Durham (NC): Duke University Press; Clarke, K.R., Non-parametric multivariate analyses of change in community structure (1993) Australian Journal of Ecology, 18, pp. 117-143; Connell, J.H., Field experiments in marine ecology (1974) Experimental Marine Biology, pp. 21-54. , Mariscal R, ed.
