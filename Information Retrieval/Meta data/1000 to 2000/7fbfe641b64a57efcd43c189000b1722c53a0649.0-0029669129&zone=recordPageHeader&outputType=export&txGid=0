Issues concerning hydrologic model calibration and validation in the context of climate change are addressed. Greenhouse-warming scenarios in midlatitudinal basins of the United States, predict shorter winter seasons, larger winter floods, drier and more frequent summer weather, and overall enhanced and protracted hydrologic variability. All these predictions point to potentially worsening conditions for flood control, water storage, and water supply in areas of semiarid midlatitudinal climates currently dependent of spring snowmelt. Practice of sound water resources engineering principles ought to be adequate to cope with additional hydrologic uncertainty that might arise from global warming. -from Authors",,"climate change; GCM; global warming; hydrological cycle; water resource management; USA",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029669129
