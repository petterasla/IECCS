Human activities have rapidly increased in the peatland ecosystems during the last two decades, invariably degrading them and making them vulnerable to fires. This causes high carbon emissions that contribute to global climate change. For this article, we used 94 high resolution (1020 m) satellite images to map the status of peatland degradation and development in Sumatra and Kalimantan using visual image interpretation. The results reveal that less than 4% of the peatland areas remain covered by pristine peatswamp forests (PSFs), while 37% are covered by PSFs with varying degree of degradation. Furthermore, over 20% is considered to be unmanaged degraded landscape, occupied by ferns, shrubs and secondary growth. This alarming extent of degradation makes peatlands vulnerable to accelerated peat decomposition and catastrophic fire episodes that will have global consequences. With on-going degradation and development the existence of the entire tropical peatland ecosystem in this region is in great danger. © 2010 Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.","Indonesia; Peatland degradation; Southeast Asia; Tropical peatland","carbon emission; climate change; environmental degradation; fire; human activity; image analysis; nature-society relations; peatland; satellite imagery; tropical environment; agriculture; article; ecosystem; environmental protection; Indonesia; soil; tree; Agriculture; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Indonesia; Soil; Trees; Greater Sunda Islands; Indonesia; Kalimantan; Sumatra; Sunda Isles; Filicophyta",,"Soil",,,,"Chan, Y.K., Lim, X.W., Miettinen, J., Analysis of Vegetation Fire Distribution in Insular Southeast Asia in 2009 (2010) Proceedings of the Young Defence Scientist Program (YDSP) Congress 2010, , 8 April 2010, Singapore; Cochrane, M.A., Synergistic interactions between habitat fragmentation and fire in evergreen tropical forests (2001) Conservation Biology, 15, pp. 1515-1521; Corlett, R.T., (2009) The Ecology of Tropical East Asia, , New York: Oxford University Press; Goldammer, J.G., Forests on fire (1999) Science New Series, 284, pp. 1782-1783; Heil, A., Langmann, B., Aldrian, E., Indonesian peat and vegetation fire emissions: Study on factors influencing large-scale smoke haze pollution using a regional atmospheric chemistry model (2006) Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change, 12, pp. 113-133; Hirano, T., Segah, H., Harada, T., Limin, S., June, T., Hirata, R., Osaki, M., Carbon dioxide balance of a tropical peat swamp forest in Kalimantan, Indonesia (2007) Global Change Biology, 13, pp. 412-425; Jaenicke, J., Rieley, J.O., Mott, C., Kimman, P., Siegert, F., Determination of the amount of carbon stored in Indonesian peatlands (2008) Geoderma, 147, pp. 151-158; Jauhiainen, J., Limin, S., Silvennoinen, H., Vasander, H., Carbon dioxide and methane fluxes in drained tropical peat before and after hydrological restoration (2008) Ecology, 89, pp. 3503-3514; Jauhiainen, J., Takahashi, H., Heikkinen, J.E.P., Martikainen, P.J., Vasander, H., Carbon fluxes from a tropical peat swamp forest floor (2005) Global Change Biology, 11, pp. 1788-1797; King, R.B., Land cover mapping principles: A return to interpretation fundamentals (2002) International Journal of Remote Sensing, 23, pp. 3525-3545; Kool, D.M., Buurman, P., Hoekman, D.H., Oxidation and compaction of a collapsed peat dome in Central Kalimantan (2006) Geoderma, 137, pp. 217-225; Langner, A., Siegert, F., Spatiotemporal fire occurrence in Borneo over a period of 10 years (2009) Global Change Biology, 15, pp. 48-62; Laumonier, Y., (1997) The Vegetation and Physiography of Sumatra, , The Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Publishers; Miettinen, J., Liew, S.C., Connection between fire and land cover change in Southeast Asia: A remote sensing case study in Riau, Sumatra (2005) International Journal of Remote Sensing, 26, pp. 1109-1126; Morrogh-Bernard, H., Husson, S., Page, S.E., Rieley, J.O., Population status of the Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) in the Sebangau peat swamp forest, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia (2003) Biological Conservation, 110, pp. 141-152; Page, S.E., Banks, C., Tropical peatlands: Distribution, extent and carbon storage\uncertainties and knowledge gaps (2007) Peatlands International, 2, pp. 26-27; Page, S.E., Hoscilo, A., Wösten, H., Jauhiainen, J., Silvius, M., Rieley, J., Ritzema, H., Suwido, L., Restoration ecology of lowland tropical peatlands in Southeast Asia: Current knowledge and future research directions (2009) Ecosystems, 12, pp. 888-905; Page, S.E., Siegert, F., Rieley, J., Boehm, H.-D.V., Jaya, A., Limin, S., The amount of carbon released from peat and forest fires in Indonesia during 1997 (2002) Nature, 420, pp. 61-65; (2005) Wise Use of Tropical Peatlands: Focus of Southeast Asia.
