Wood fuels, which have an important role in the cause of both providing energy requirement of production units and heating for household and healing energy deficit, disperse very less CO2 than fossil fuels to atmosphere. Bio-fuels are used to provide energy requirement among EU countries like using in lots of developed countries. Resources having by lots developed countries and EU countries are not at enough level for bio-fuels. For this reason, trade of bio-fuels has been become in an important situation in recent years. In this study, import and export levels of bio-fuels of EU countries and Turkey, which is a candidate for union, were investigated between 2003 and 2006. The date is obtained from European Forest Institute (EFI) forest products trade flow database. As a result of the study, while rises were determined in years, it is determined that the most important exporters are Germany, Italy, Latvia and Poland and the most important importers are Germany, Italy, Belgium and UK. It is seen that Turkey has a low trade level in selected product groups. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Biomass; European union; Forest products; Turkey; Wood fuel","Belgium; Developed countries; Energy deficit; Energy requirements; EU countries; European forest institutes; European Union; Forest products; Germany; Product groups; Production units; Turkey; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Heating; International trade; Wood; Wood fuels; biofuel; biomass power; European Union; forest product; fossil fuel; fuelwood; global warming; trade flow; Biomass; Foreign Trade; Forest Products; Fossil Fuels; Germany; Heating; Latvia; Poland; Turkey; Wood; Germany; Italy; Latvia; Turkey; United Kingdom",,,,,,"Angenent, L.T., Karim, K., Al-Dahhan, M.H., Wrenn, B.A., Domiguez-Espinosa, R., Production of bioenergy and biochemicals from industrial and agricultural wastewater (2004) Trends Biotechnol, 22, pp. 477-485; Bhattacharya, S.C., Albina, D.O., Solam, P.A., Emission factors of wood and charcoal-fired cook stoves (2002) Biomass Bioenergy, 23, pp. 453-469; Demirbaş, A., Biofuels sources, biofuel policy, biofuel economy and global biofuel projections (2008) Energy Convers Manage, 49, pp. 2106-2116; Demirbaş, A., Demirbaş, A.Ş., Demirbaş, A.H., Briquetting properties of biomass waste materials (2004) Energy Sources, 26, pp. 83-91; Hillring, B., The Swedish wood fuel market (1999) Renew Energ, 16, pp. 1031-1036; Hillring, B., Incentives for co-firing in bio-fuelled industrial steam, heat and power production (2002) Renew Energ, 28, pp. 843-848; Top, N., Mizoue, N., Ito, S., Kai, S., Spatial analysis of woodfuel supply and demand in Kampong Thom Province, Cambodia (2004) Forest Ecol Manag, 194, pp. 369-378; Mead, D.J., Forest for energy and the role of planted trees (2005) Crit Rev plant Sci, 24, pp. 407-421; Brouwer, R., Falcao, M.P., Wood fuel consumption in Maputo Mozambique (2004) Biomass Bioenergy, 27, pp. 233-245; (2008), http://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol, URL 1Arnold, M., Köhlin, G., Persson, R., Shepherd, G., (2003) Fuel wood revisited: what has changed in the last decade?, , Occasional paper No.39, CIFOR; Hillring, B., World trade in forest products and wood fuel (2006) Biomass Bioenergy, 30, pp. 815-825; (2008) EFI/WFSE forest products trade flow database, , http://www.efi.fi, European Forest Institute; (2008) Food and agriculture organization of the United Nations, , http://apps.fao.org, FAO; Kaygusuz, K., Türker, M.F., Biomass energy potential in Turkey (2002) Renew Energ, 26, pp. 661-678; Ediger, V.S., Kentel, E., Renewable energy potential as an alternative to fossil fuels in Turkey (1999) Energy Convers Manage, 40, pp. 743-755; (1993) Forecast for biofuel trade in Europe the Swedish market in 2000, 10. , Forecast, Swedish National Board for Industrial and Technical Development, Stockholm; Ericsson, K., Nilson, L.J., International biofuel trade a study of Swedish import (2004) Biomass Bioenergy, 26, pp. 205-220; Parikka, M., Global biomass fuel resources (2004) Biomass Bioenergy, 27, pp. 613-620; Chamitz, K.M., Griffiths, C., An Economic analysis and simulation of wood fuel management in the Sahel (2001) Environ Resource Econ, 19, pp. 285-304; Tabuti, J.R.S., Dhillion, S.S., Lye, K.A., Firewood use in Bulomagi Country, Uganda: species selection, harvesting and consumption patterns (2003) Biomass Bioenergy, 25, pp. 581-596; Kituyi, E., Marufu, L., Wandiga, S.O., Jumba, I.O., Andreae, M.O., Helas, G., Biofuel availability and domestic use patterns in Kenya (2001) Biomass Bioenergy, 20, pp. 71-82; Brito, J.O., Fuelwood utilization in Brazil (1997) Biomass Bioenergy, 12 (1), pp. 69-74; Okello, B.D., O'Conner, T.G., Young, T.P., Growth, biomass estimates and charcoal production of Acacia repanolobium in Laikipia.
