This study developed a GAPCR (Gliding Arc Plasma-Catalyst Reformer) which convert the biogas into higher percentage of hydrogen as low pollution recycling energy, reduced the global warming and environmental problems. This study also conducted tests for the different variables that affect the biogas reforming efficiency of the GAPCR, and presented the optimum operating conditions for high percentage of hydrogen generation. The parametric studies were carried out according to the change of steam to carbon ratio, catalyst bed temperature, total gas flow rate, input electric power, and biogas component ratio, i.e., CH 4:CO 2. The hydrogen concentration increased up to specific limit, and then maintained almost constant values for the same steam to carbon ratio and catalyst bed temperature. Hydrogen percentage decreased with the increase in total gas flow rate but little bit increases with the increase in electric power. In terms of biogas component ratio, hydrogen concentration decreased with the increase of CO 2 amount. The optimum operating conditions showed the concentrations of 62% H 2, 8% CO, 27% CO 2, and 0.0% CH 4 on the basis of steam to carbon ratio of 3, catalyst bed temperature of 700 °C, total gas flow rate of 16 L/min, input electric power of 2.4 kW, and biogas component ratio of 6:4 (CH 4:CO 2). At this condition, H 2 yield and H 2 selectivity were same values of 59%. Energy efficiency and specific energy requirement were 53% and 289 kJ/mol, respectively. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.
