The long-term solar activity cyclicity during the last millennium with periods of approximately 90 and 210 years, which can be related to substantial climatic warming and cooling events in this millennium, has been established based on an analysis of these data. It has been indicated that long-term recent climate warming can result from the effect of the ~90- and ~210-year solar cycles on the climatic system, which is characterized by the nonlinear dynamics. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd., 2009.",,,,,,,,"Agnihotri, R., Dutta, K., Bhushan, R., Somayajulu, B.L.K., Evidence for Solar Forcing on Indian Monsoon during the Last Millennium (2002) Geotektonika, 198, pp. 521-527; Climate Change 2007: The Fourth Assessment Report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Paris, 2007Dergachev, V.A., Raspopov, O.M., Long-Term Processes on the Sun Controlling Trends in the Solar Irradiance and the Earth's Surface Temperature (2000) Geomagn.
