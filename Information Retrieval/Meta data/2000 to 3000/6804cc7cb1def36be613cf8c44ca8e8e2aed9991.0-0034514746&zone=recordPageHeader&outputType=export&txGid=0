Location: This ecosystem is part of the Big Cypress Natural Preserve, located in the south-west part of Florida (USA) between the Mangrove Swamps that border the Gulf of Mexico and the Everglades. Methods: This investigation was carried out by constructing networks of carbon exchange between the living and nonliving components that comprise this ecosystem. By means of these networks potential for carbon accumulation has been assessed by identifying and quantifying pathways for the transfer of carbon, assessing the efficiency between trophic levels, and evaluating the importance of material cycling. These analyses are commonly referred to as network analysis. Results: Results obtained show that dependency on detritus by higher trophic levels is rather low and so is the trophic efficiency. Yet, less than 10% of the carbon that flows through the system is recycled and the magnitude of internal ascendency reaches only 40% of the total system ascendency. Main conclusions: All these results support the hypothesis that the South Florida Cypress Wetlands are predominately flow-through in nature and that carbon accumulation in this environment is noticeable.","Carbon processing; Carbon-accumulating system; Cypress wetlands; Global warming; Network analysis","carbon cycle; ecosystem approach; network analysis; nutrient dynamics; wetland; United States",,,,,,"Baird, D., Luczkovich, J., Christian, R.R., (1999) Assessment of spatial and temporal variability in ecosystem attributes of the St. Marks National Wildlife Refugee, Apalachee Bay, Florida, , Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science, in press; Baird, D., Ulanowicz, R.E., The seasonal dynamics of the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem (1989) Ecological Monographs, 59, pp. 329-364; Bondavalli, C., Naldi, M., Christian, R.R., Cs-137 circulation in a eutrophic lagoon: A modelling approach (1998) Verhandlungen der Internationalen Vereinigung Limnologie, 26, pp. 1422-1425; Costa, P.M., Tropical forestry practices for carbon sequestration: A review and case study from Southeast Asia (1996) Ambio, 25, pp. 279-283; De Angelis, D.L., Gross, L.J., Huston, M.A., Wolff, W.F., Fleming, D.M., Comiskey, E.J., Sylvesyer, S.M., Landscape modelling for Everglades ecosystem restoration (1998) Ecosystems, 1, pp. 64-75; Dierberg, F.E., Ewel, K.C., The effects of wastewater on decomposition and organic matter accumulation in cypress domes (1986) Cypress swamps, pp. 164-170. , (ed. by K.
