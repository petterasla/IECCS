The habitats associated with these different subspecies vary considerably, with mountainous habitats in the west and floodplain habitats in the east. Despite these challenges, continuing environmental change resulting from the construction o/the Three Gorges Dam and global warming that threaten to increase snail habitat, as well as limited public health resources, require the ability to accurately map and prioritize areas at risk for schistosomiasis. This paper describes a series of ongoing studies that rely on remotely sensed data to predict schistosomiasis risk in two regions of China. The first study is a classification of tandsat TM imagery to identify snail habitats in mountainous regions of Sichuan Province. The accuracy of this classification was assessed in an independent field study, which revealed that seasonal flooding may have contributed to misclassification, and that the incorporation of soil maps may greatly improve classification accuracy. A second study presents the use of tandsat TM and water level data to understand seasonal differences in Oncomelania hupensis habitat in the lower Yangtze River region.",,"Biodiversity; Dams; Disease control; Floods; Global warming; Imaging techniques; Soil maps; Remote sensing; disease prevalence; prediction; remote sensing; risk assessment; schistosomiasis; snail; China; Oncomelania hupensis",,,,,,"Bergquist, N.R., Malone, J.B., Kristensen, T.K., Schistosomiasis information systems and control of snail-borne diseases (2000) Parasitology Today, 16 (9), pp. 363-364; Breiman, L., (1984) Classification and Regression Trees, , The Wadsworth Statistics/Probability Series, Wadsworth International Group, Belmont, California, x + 358 p; Brooker, S., Michael, E., The potential of geographical information systems and remote sensing in the epidemiology and control of human helminth infections (2000) Advances in Parasitology, 47, pp. 245-288; Chen, M., Feng, Z., Schistosomiasis control in China (1999) Parasitology International, 48, pp. 11-19; Cross, E.R., Sheffield, C., Perrine, R., Pazzaglia, G., Predicting areas endemic for schistosomiasis using weather variables and a Landsat data base (1984) Military Medicine, 149 (10), pp. 542-544; Cross, E.R., Newcomb, W.W., Tucker, C.J., Use of weather data and remote sensing to predict the geographic and seasonal distribution of Phlebotomus papatasi in southwest Asia (1996) American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, 54 (5), pp. 530-536; Davis, G.M., Yi, Z., Hua, G.Y., Spolsky, C., Population genetics and systematic status of Oncomelania hupensis (Gastropoda: Pomatiopsidae) throughout China (1995) Matacologia, 37 (1), pp. 133-156; Davis, G.M., Wilke, T., Spolsky, C., Qiu, C.-P., Qiu, D.-C., Xia, M.-Y., Zhang, Y., Rosenberg, G., Cytochrome oxidase I-based phylogenetic relationships among the Pomatiopsidae, Hydrobiidae, Rissoidae and Truncatellidae (Gastropoda: Caenogastropoda: Rissoacea) (1998) Malacologia, 40 (1-2), pp. 251-266; Davis, G.M., Wilke, T., Zhang, Y., Xu, X.J., Qiu, C.P., Spolsky, C., Qiu, D.C., Feng, Z., Snail-schistosoma, paragonimus interactions in China: Population ecology, genetic diversity, coevolution and emerging diseases (1999) Malacologia, 41 (2), pp. 355-377; Duda, R.O., Hart, P.E., (1973) Pattern Classification and Scene Analysis, , Wiley, New York, N.Y., xvii + 482 p; Foody, G.M., Campbell, N.A., Trodd, N.M., Wood, T.F., Derivation and applications of probabilistic measures of class membership from the maximum-likelihood classification (1992) Photogrammetric Engineering & Remote Sensing, 58 (9), pp. 1335-1341; Gu, X.G., (1990) Epidemiological Investigation of Schistosomiasis in Minhe and Hexing Villages, Xichang, Sichuan Province, , Sichuan Institute of Antiparasite Diseases, Chengdu, Sichuan, P.R.C.
