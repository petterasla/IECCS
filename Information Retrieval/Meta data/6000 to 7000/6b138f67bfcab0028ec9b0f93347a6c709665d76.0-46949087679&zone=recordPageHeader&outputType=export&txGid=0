The mesocosms were filled with winter water from the Kiel Fjord, Baltic Sea. Two of them were started at ∼2°C and the temperature was subsequently increased according to the decadal temperature profile of the fjord (ΔT 0°C, baseline treatment). The other mesocosms were run at 3 elevated temperatures with differences of ΔT+2, +4 and +6°C. All mesocosms were exposed to the same light conditions. Timing of peak phytoplankton primary production (PP) during the experimental spring bloom was not significantly influenced by increasing temperatures, whereas the peak of bacterial secondary production (BSP) was accelerated by about 2 d per °C. This suggests that, in case of warming, the spring peak of bacterial degradation of organic matter (in terms of BSP) would occur earlier in the year. Furthermore, the lag time between the peaks of PP and BSP (about 16 d for ΔT 0°C) would diminish progressively at elevated temperatures. The average ratio between BSP and PP increased significantly from 0.37 in the coldest mesocosms to 0.63 in the warmest ones. Community respiration and the contribution of picoplankton (&lt;3 μm fraction) to this also increased at elevated temperatures. Our results lead to the prediction that climate warming during the winter/early spring in temperate climate zones will favor bacterial degradation of organic matter by tightening the coupling between phytoplankton and bacteria. However, if PP is reduced by warming, as in our experiments, this will not necessarily lead to increased recycling of organic matter (and CO2). © Inter-Research 2008.","Bacterial secondary production; Baltic Sea; Climate change; Global warming; Marine bacteria; Mesocosm; Primary production; Respiration","Bacteria (microorganisms)",,,,,,"Aberle, N., Lengfellner, K., Sommer, U., Spring bloom succession, grazing impact and herbivore selectivity of ciliate communities in response to winter warming (2007) Oecologia, 150, pp. 668-681; Azam, F., Microbial control of oceanic carbon flux: The plot thickens (1998) Science, 280, pp. 694-696; Beisner, B.E., McCauley, E., Wrona, F.J., The influence of temperature and food chain length on plankton predator-prey dynamics (1997) Can J Fish Aquat Sci, 54, pp. 586-595; Berg GM, Gilbert PM, Chen CC (1999) Dimension effects of enclosures on ecological processes in pelagic systems.
