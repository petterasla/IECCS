The plants were grown as a mixed community in 14L containers and were exposed to ozone in ventilated solardomes (dome-shaped greenhouses) for 20 weeks from early May to late September 2007. Ozone exposures were based on O3 concentrations from a nearby upland area, and provided the following seasonal 24 h means: 21.4, 39.9 (simulated ambient), 50.2, 59.4, 74.9, 83.3, 101.3 and 102.5 ppb. In both species, stomatal conductance of undamaged inner canopy leaves developing since a midseason cutback increased linearly with increasing background ozone concentration. Imposition of severe water stress by leaf excision indicated that increasing background ozone concentration decreased the ability of leaves to limit water loss, implying impaired stomatal control. The threshold ozone concentrations for these effects were 15-40 ppb above current ambient in upland UK, and were within the range of ozone concentrations anticipated for much of Europe by the latter part of this century. The potential mechanism behind the impaired stomatal functioning was investigated using a transpiration assay. Unlike for lower ozone treatments, apparently healthy green leaves of L. hispidus that had developed in the 101.3 ppb treatment did not close their stomata in response to 1.5 μm abscisic acid (ABA); indeed stomatal opening initially occurred in this treatment. Thus, ozone appears to be disrupting the ABA-induced signal transduction pathway for stomatal control thereby reducing the ability of plants to respond to drought. These results have potentially wide-reaching implications for the functioning of communities under global warming where periods of soil drying and episodes of high vapour pressure deficit are likely to be more severe. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing.","Abscisic acid; Dactylis glomerata; Drought tolerance; Grassland species; Leontodon hispidus; Ozone; Rising background; Stomata; Stomatal conductance","abscisic acid; air exposure; concentration (composition); drought resistance; grassland; ozone; stomatal conductance; threshold; water stress; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe; Dactylis; Dactylis glomerata; Leontodon hispidus",,,,,,"Ashmore, M.R., Bûker, P., Emberson, L.D., Terry, A.C., Toet, S., Modelling stomatal ozone flux and deposition to grassland communities across Europe (2007) Environmental Pollution, 146, pp. 659-670; Atkinson, C.J., Davies, W.J., Mansfield, T.A., Changes in stomatal conductance in intact aging wheat leaves in response to abscisic-acid (1989) Journal of Experimental Botany, 40, pp. 1021-1028; Barnes, J.D., Eamus, J.D., Davison, A.W., Ro-Poulsen, H., Mortensen, L., Persistent effects of ozone on needle water-loss and wettability in Norway Spruce (1990) Environmental Pollution, 63, pp. 345-363; Bassin, S., Volk, M., Fuhrer, J., Factors affecting the ozone sensitivity of temperate European grasslands: An overview (2007) Environmental Pollution, 146, pp. 678-691; Bernacchi, C.J., Leakey, A.D.B., Heady, L.E., Hourly and seasonal variation in photosynthesis and stomatal conductance of soybean grown at future CO2 and ozone concentrations for 3 years under fully open-air field conditions (2006) Plant, Cell and Environment, 29, pp. 2077-2090; Cape, J.N., Van der Eerden, L.J., Sheppard, L.J., Leith, I.D., Sutton, M.A., Evidence for changing the critical level for ammonia (2008) Environmental Pollution, , in press; Davison, A.W., Barnes, J.D., Effects of ozone on wild plants (1998) New Phytologist, 139, pp. 135-151; Dawnay, L., Mills, G., Relative effects of elevated background ozone concentrations and peak episodes on senescence and above-ground growth in four populations of Anthoxanthum odoratum L Environmental Pollution, , in press; De Silva, D.L.R., Mansfield, T.A., McAinsh, M.R., Changes in stomatal behaviour in the calcicole Leontodon hispidus due to the disruption by ozone of the regulation of apoplastic Ca2+ by trichomes (2001) Planta, 214, pp. 158-162; Derwent, R.G., Simmonds, P.G., Manning, A.J., Spain, T.G., Trends over a 20-year period from 1987 to 2007 in surface ozone at the atmospheric research station, Mace head, Ireland (2007) Atmospheric Environment, 41, pp. 9091-9098; Emberson, L.D., Ashmore, M.R., Cambridge, H.M., Simpson, D., Tuovinen, J.-P., Modelling stomatal ozone flux across Europe (2000) Environmental Pollution, 109, pp. 403-413; Felzer, B., Reilly, J., Melillo, J., Future effects of ozone on carbon sequestration and climate change policy using a global biogeochemical model (2005) Climatic Change, 73, pp. 345-373; Fiscus, E.L., Booker, F.L., Burkey, K.O., Crop responses to ozone: Uptake, modes of action, carbon assimilation and partitioning (2005) Plant, Cell and Environment, 28, pp. 997-1011; Fuhrer, J., Booker, F.L., Ecological issues related to ozone: Agricultural issues (2003) Environment International, 29, pp. 141-154; Grandjean Grimm, A., Fuhrer, J., The responses of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to ozone at higher elevations III Responses of leaf and canopy gas exchange, and chlorophyll fluorescence to ozone flux (1992) New Phytologist, 122, pp. 321-328; Grulke, N.E., Physiological responses of Ponderosa pine to gradients of environmental stressors (1999) Oxidant Air Pollution Impacts in the Montane Forests of Southern California, , In: (eds Miller PR, McBride JR), Springer-Verlag, New York, NY, USA; Grulke, N.E., Neufeld, H.S., Davison, A.W., Roberts, M., Chappelka, A.H., Stomatal behaviour of ozone-sensitive and -insensitive coneflowers (Rudbeckia laciniata var. digitata) in Great Smoky Mountains National Park (2007) New Phytologist, 173, pp. 100-109; Hayes, F., The effects of ozone on semi-natural vegetation (2007), PhD thesis, University of York, YorkHayes, F., Jones, M.L.M., Mills, G., Ashmore, M., Meta-analysis of the relative sensitivity of semi-natural vegetation species to ozone (2007) Environmental Pollution, 146, pp. 754-762; Hayes, F., Mills, G., Harmens, H., Norris, D., (2007) Evidence of Widespread Ozone Damage to Vegetation in Europe (1990-2006), p. 58. , ICP Vegetation Programme Coordination Centre, CEH Bangor, UK (ISBN 978-0-9557672-1-0); Jaffe, D., Ray, J., Increase in surface ozone at rural sites in the western US (2007) Atmospheric Environment, 41, pp. 5452-5463; (2004) Chapter 3, Manual on Methodologies and Criteria for Modelling and Mapping Critical Loads and Levels and Air Pollution Effects, Risks and Trends, , http://www.icpmapping.org, LRTAP Convention 2007 revision.
