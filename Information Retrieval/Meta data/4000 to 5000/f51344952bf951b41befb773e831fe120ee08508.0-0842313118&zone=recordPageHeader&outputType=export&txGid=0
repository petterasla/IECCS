An adapted forest dynamics model is used to simulate tree diversity change of the remaining primary mixed-broadleaved Korean pine forest (RPMKPF) in northeast China under global climate change and local human activities for the next 50 years. Human activities include logging, which removes all big trees (DBH &gt; 50 cm), removing all individuals of each single species and all species of each functional type (shade tolerant, shade intolerant and medium type tree species). As results for RPMKPF, the α index of tree diversity decreases under climate change, but it increases significantly under a combination of climate change and logging. Removing all individuals of each single species significantly affects the tree diversity of the ecosystem. After the removal of shade tolerant species, both α and βc indices of tree diversity experience a significant change. The α index decreases significantly under climate change when shade intolerant or medium type tree species are removed, but the βc index does not change significantly. The results of this study have implications for tree diversity management in RPMKPF under climate change and human activities.","α diversity; βc diversity; Logging; Medium type species; Removing species; Shade intolerant species; Shade tolerant species","biodiversity; climate change; conservation; human activity; shade tolerance; Asia; Eurasia; Far East; Korea; Pinus koraiensis",,,,,,"Botkin, D.B., Janak, J.F., Wallis, J.R., Some ecological consequences of a computer model of forest growth (1972) Journal of Ecology, 60, pp. 849-873; Box, E.O., Crumpacker, D.W., Hardin, E.D., Predicted effects of climatic change on distribution of ecologically important native tree and shrub species in Florida (1999) Climatic Change, 41, pp. 213-248; Brown, J.H., Two decades of homage to Santa Rosalia: Toward a general theory of diversity (1981) American Zoology, 21, pp. 877-888; Bugmann, H.K.M., A simplified forest model to study species composition along climate gradients (1996) Ecology, 77, pp. 2055-2074; Chen, D., The structure, function and succession of 4 types of natural secondary forests (1982) Journal of Northeast Forestry University, 2, pp. 2-10. , in Chinese with English abstract; Chen, X., Study on the ecological safety of the forest in Northeast China under climate change (2002) International Journal of Sustainable Development and World Ecology, 9, pp. 49-58; Chen, X., Modeling the effects of global climatic change at the ecotone of boreal larch forest and temperate forest in Northeast China (2002) Climatic Change, 55, pp. 77-97; Chen, X., Wang, F., Simulation of the potential responses of mixed coniferous and broadleaved Korean pine communities by BKPF model (2000) Acta Phytoecology Sinica, 24, pp. 327-331. , in Chinese with English abstract; Connell, J.H., Diversity in tropical rain forests and coral reefs (1978) Science, 199, pp. 1302-1310; Connell, J.H., Orias, E., The ecological regulation of species diversity (1964) American Naturalist, 98, pp. 399-414; Grime, J.P., Biodiversity and ecosystem function: The debate deepens (1997) Science, 277, pp. 1260-1261; Hansen, J., Johnson, D., Lacis, A., Climatic impact of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (1981) Science, 213, pp. 957-966; Hooper, D.U., Vitousek, P.M., The effects of plant composition and diversity on ecosystem processes (1997) Science, 277, pp. 1302-1305; Hulme, M., Wigley, T., Jiang, T., Zhao, Z., Wang, F., Ding, Y., (1992) Climate Change Caused by Greenhouse Effect and Its Effects to China, , WWF International, Gland, Switzerland; Hutchinson, G.E., Homage to Santa Rosalia, or why are there so many kinds of animals?
