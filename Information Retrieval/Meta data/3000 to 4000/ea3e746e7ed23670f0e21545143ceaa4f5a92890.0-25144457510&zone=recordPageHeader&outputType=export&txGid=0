We chose areas based on their importance to migratory bird populations, agency concerns about marsh loss and sea-level rise, and availability of historic imagery. We georeferenced and processed aerial photographs from a variety of sources ranging from 1932 to 1994. Of particular interest were changes in total salt marsh area, tidal creeks, tidal flats, tidal and non-tidal ponds, and open water habitats. Nauset Marsh, within Cape Cod National Seashore, experienced an annual marsh loss of 0.40% (19% from 1947 to 1994). with most loss attributed to sand overwash and conversion to open water. At Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge in southern New Jersey, annual loss was 0.27% (17% from 1932 to 1995), with nearly equal attribution of loss to open water and tidal pond expansion. At Curlew Bay, Virginia, annual loss was 0.20% (9% from 1949 to 1994) and almost entirely due to perimeter erosion to open water. At Gull Marsh, Virginia, a site chosen because of known erosional losses, we recorded the highest annual loss rate, 0.67% per annum, again almost entirely due to erosional, perimeter loss. In contrast, at the southernmost site, Mockhorn Island Wildlife Management Area, Virginia, there was a net gain of 0.09% per annum (4% from 1949 to 1994), with tidal flats becoming increasingly vegetated. Habitat implications for waterbirds are considerable; salt marsh specialists such as laughing gulls (Larus atricilla), Forster's terns (Sterna forsteri), black rail, (Laterallus jamaicensis), seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus), and saltmarsh sharp-tailed sparrow (Ammodramus caudacutus) are particularly at risk if these trends continue, and all but the laughing gull are species of concern to state and federal managers. © 2004, The Society of Wetland Scientists.","Atlantic coast; GIS; Marsh loss; Salt marsh; Sea-level rise; Spartina; Waterbirds","avifauna; ecosystem dynamics; habitat loss; microhabitat; saltmarsh; Cape Cod; Massachusetts; North America; United States; Western Hemisphere; World; Ammodramus caudacutus; Ammodramus maritimus; Aves; Laridae; Larus atricilla; Laterallus jamaicensis; Spartina; Sterna forsteri",,,,,,"Andresen, H., Bakker, J.P., Brongers, M., Heydemann, B., Irmler, U., Long-term changes of salt marsh communities by cattle grazing (1990) Vegetatio, 89, pp. 137-148; Boesch, D.F., Levin, D., Nummedal, D., Bowles, K., (1983) Subsidence in Coastal Louisiana: Causes, Rates, and Effects on Wetlands, , U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Washington, DC, USA.
