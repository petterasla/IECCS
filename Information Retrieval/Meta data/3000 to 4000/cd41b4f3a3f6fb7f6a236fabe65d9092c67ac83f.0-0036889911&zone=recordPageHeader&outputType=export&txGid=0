The objectives of this study were to investigate the site to site and interannual variation in soil respiration of six temperate forest sites. Soil respiration was measured using closed chambers over 2 years under mature beech, spruce and pine stands at both Solling and Unterlüβ, Germany, which have distinct climates and soils. Cumulative annual CO 2 fluxes varied from 4.9 to 5.4 Mg C ha -1 yr -1 at Solling with silty soils and from 4.0 to 5.9 Mg C ha -1 yr -1 at Unterlüß with sandy soils. With one exception soil respiration rates were not significantly different among the six forest sites (site to site variation) and between the years within the same forest site (interannual variation). Only the respiration rate in the spruce stand at Unterlüß was significant lower than the beech stand at Unterlüß in both years. Soil respiration rates of the sandy sites at Unterlüß were limited by soil moisture during the rather dry and warm summer 1999 while soil respiration at the silty Solling site tended to increase. We found a threshold of -80 kPa at 10 cm depth below which soil respiration decreased with increasing drought. Subsequent wetting of sandy soils revealed high CO 2 effluxes in the stands at Unterlüß. However, dry periods were infrequent, and our results suggest that temporal variation in soil moisture generally had little effect on annual soil respiration rates. Soil temperature at 5 cm and 10 cm depth explained 83% of the temporal variation in soil respiration using the Arrhenius function. The correlations were weaker using temperature at 0 cm (r 2 = 0.63) and 2.5 cm depth (r 2 = 0.81). Mean Q 10 values for the range from 5 to 15 °C increased asymptotically with soil depth from 1.87 at 0 cm to 3.46 at 10 cm depth, indicating a large uncertainty in the prediction of the temperature dependency of soil respiration. Comparing the fitted Arrhenius curves for same tree species from Solling and Unterlüß revealed higher soil respiration rates for the stands at Solling than in the respective stands at Unterlüß at the same temperature. A significant positive correlation across all sites between predicted soil respiration rates at 10 °C and total phosphorus content and C-to-N ratio of the upper mineral soil indicate a possible effect of nutrients on soil respiration.","Beech forest; Pine forest; Soil drought; Soil respiration; Soil temperature; Spruce forest","forest ecosystem; global warming; rainfall; soil respiration; soil temperature; spatial variation; temporal variation; Fagus; Fagus sylvatica; Picea; Picea abies; Pinus sylvestris",,,,,,"Andrews, J.A., Harrison, K.G., Matamala, R., Separation of root respiration from total soil respiration using carbon-13 labeling during Free-Air Carbon Dioxide Enrichment (FACE) (1999) Soil Science Society of America Journal, 63, pp. 1429-1435; Birch, H.F., Further observations on humus decomposition and nitrification (1959) Plant and Soil, 9, pp. 262-286; (1997) Deutscher Waldbodenbericht 1996, 1. , BMELF Bundesministerium für Ernährung, Landwirtschaft und Forsten, Bonn, Germany; Boone, R.D., Nadelhoffer, K.J., Canary, J.D., Roots exert a strong influence on the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration (1998) Nature, 396, pp. 570-572; Borken, W., Muhs, A., Beese, F., Changes in microbial and soil properties following compost treatment of degraded temperate forest soils (2002) Soil Biology and Biochemistry, 34, pp. 403-412; Borken, W., Xu, Y.-J., Brumme, R., A climate change scenario for carbon dioxide and dissolved organic carbon fluxes from a temperate forest soil: Drought and rewetting effects (1999) Soil Science Society of America Journal, 63, pp. 1848-1855; Buchmann, N., Biotic and abiotic factors controlling soil respiration rates in Picea abies stands (2000) Soil Biology and Biochemistry, 32, pp. 1625-1635; Carlyle, J.C., Tan, U.B., Abiotic controls of soil respiration beneath an eighteen-year-old Pinus radiata stand in South-eastern Australia (1988) Journal of Ecology, 76, pp. 654-662; Davidson, E.A., Belk, E., Boone, R.D., Soil water content and temperature as independent or confounded factors controlling soil respiration in a temperate mixed hardwood forest (1998) Global Change Biology, 4, pp. 217-227; Eswaran, H., Van Den Berg, E., Reich, P., Organic carbon in soils of the world (1993) Soil Science Society of America Journal, 57, pp. 192-194; Ewel, K.C., Cropper, W.P., Gholz, H.L., Soil CO 2 evolution in Florida slash pine plantations.
