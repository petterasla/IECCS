One method to control CO2 emissions is to sequester it underground. Leakage from storage must be minimized for long-term control. Detection of leaks decreases the amount of CO2 released from storage, so onsite monitoring must be performed over large areas. Spiking the injected CO2 with an isotopic tracer can improve ground leak detection using fewer sampling stations, with greater accuracy than CO 2 sensors and no interference from radon gas. The relative merits of sorbent materials, isotopic tracers, detection methods and potential interferences will be discussed. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,"carbon 14; carbon dioxide; radon; acidification; article; chemical reaction; environmental impact; gas diffusion; greenhouse effect; spectroscopy",,"carbon 14, 14762-75-5; carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; radon, 10043-92-2",,,,"Houghton, J., (2005) Rep.
