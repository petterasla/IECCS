More than 200000 records for six phenological events (leaf unfolding, flowering, fruit ripening, fruit harvesting, leaf falling and growing season) of 29 perennial species for the period 1943-2003 recorded throughout Spain provide the longest temporal and the broadest spatial assessment of plant phenology changes in the Mediterranean region. The overwhelming majority of the 118 studied phenophases shifted their dates in recent decades. Such changes differed among phenological events. Leaf unfolding, flowering and fruiting are markedly advancing (-0.48, -0.59 and -0.32 days yr-1, respectively), but only since the mid-1970s. Anemophilous have advanced more days their flowering than entomophilous. However, some species have delayed and others have advanced their leaf falling dates and as a result only a weak shift was observed in this event for the whole of the studied species (+0.12 days yr-1). The growing season lengthened by 18 days, which implies an increase of 8% in the life of annual leaves. Such an increase was achieved mainly through the advance of leaf unfolding dates in the spring, one of the most productive times of year for vegetation in the Mediterranean. Shifts in the plant calendar were accompanied as well by long-term changes in the range of onset dates in 39% of studied phenophases. Leaf unfolding, flowering and growing season tended to reduce spatial variability, reflecting a faster and more synchronized onset (or duration) of phenophases across the study area. Changes in spatial variability may aggravate calendar mismatching with other trophic levels resulting from changes in dates. Because temporal responses differed markedly among species, calendar guilds of plants have changed, which suggests alterations of interspecific relationships in plant communities from Mediterranean ecosystems. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Flowering; Fruiting; Growingseason; Leaf unfolding; Leaffalling; Life cycles; Long-term study; Spain; Time-series","climate change; climate effect; flowering; fruiting; growing season; life cycle; long-term change; phenology; plant; spatial variation; temporal analysis; Mediterranean Region; Mediterranean Sea",,,,,,"Ahas, R., Aasa, A., The effects of climate change on the phenology of selected Estonian plant, bird and fish populations (2006) International Journal of Biometeorology, 51, pp. 17-26; Ahas, R., Aasa, A., Menzel, A., Fedotova, V.G., Scheifinger, H., Changes in European spring phenology (2002) International Journal of Climatology, 22, pp. 1727-1738; Allen-Wardell, G., Bernhardt, P., Bitner, R., The potential consequences of pollinator declines on the conservation of biodiversity and stability of food crop yields (1998) Conservation Biology, 12, pp. 8-17; Andrés, M.V., Durán, J.M., Self-incompatibility in Spanish clones of apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.) tree (1998) Euphytica, 101, pp. 349-355; Andreu, L., Gutiérrez, E., Macias, M., Ribas, M., Bosch, O., Camarero, J.J., Climate increases regional tree-growth variability in Iberian pine forests (2007) Global Change Biology, 13, pp. 804-815; (1942) Las Observaciones Fenológicas, Indicaciones Para Su Implantación En España, , Anonymous Servicio Meteorológico Nacional - Sección de Climatología, Madrid; (1943) Atlas De Plantas Para Las Observaciones Fenológicas.,, , Anonymous Servicio Meteorológico Nacional -Sección de Climatología, Madrid; (1989) Normas E Instrucciones Para Las Observaciones Fenológicas, , Anonymous Sección de Meterología Agrícola y Fenología -Instituto Nacional de Meteorología, Madrid; Araújo, M.B., Rahbek, C., How does climate change affect biodiversity?
