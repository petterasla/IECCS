An Environmental Forum, comprising 80 organizations, was established. This was responsible for producing an environmental action programme (EAP) in March 1993. The paper discusses the major measures relating to transport in the EAP and how they contribute to the relief of global warming, to reviving towns, to improving air quality, and to conserving wildlife and the countryside. These measures are also linked to the sustainability objectives as put forward by the Earth Summit Conference in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, and subsequently by those of the EU and the UK Government. -from Author",,"air pollution; environmental action programme; Lancashire County Council; pollution control; transport planning; vehicle emission; UK, England, Lancashire",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"English",,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029545095
