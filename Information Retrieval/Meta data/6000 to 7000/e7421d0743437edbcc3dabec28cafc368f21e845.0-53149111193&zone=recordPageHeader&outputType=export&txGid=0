This paper discusses how tropical forestry practices can contribute to maintaining or enhancing the adaptive capacity of natural and planted forests to global climate change and considers challenges and opportunities for the integration of tropical forest management in broader climate change adaptation. In addition to the use of reduced impact logging to maintain ecosystem integrity, other approaches may be needed, such as fire prevention and management, as well as specific silvicultural options aimed at facilitating genetic adaptation. In the case of planted forests, the normally higher intensity of management (with respect to natural forest) offers additional opportunities for implementing adaptation measures, at both industrial and smallholder levels. Although the integration in forest management of measures aimed at enhancing adaptation to climate change may not involve substantial additional effort with respect to current practice, little action appears to have been taken to date. Tropical foresters and forest-dependent communities appear not to appreciate the risks posed by climate change and, for those who are aware of them, practical guidance on how to respond is largely non-existent. The extent to which forestry research and national policies will promote and adopt management practices in order to assist production forests adapt to climate change is currently uncertain. Mainstreaming adaptation into national development and planning programs may represent an initial step towards the incorporation of climate change considerations into tropical forestry. © 2007 The Author(s).","Adaptation; Climate change; Natural forest management; Tropical forests; Tropical tree plantations","adaptation; climate change; forest ecosystem; forest management; forestry policy; forestry practice; global climate; logging (timber); mitigation; silviculture; tropical forest",,,,,,"Adger, W.N., Huq, S., Brown, K., Conway, D., Hulme, M., Adaptation to climate change in the developing world (2003) Prog Dev Stud, 3, pp. 179-195; Adger, W.N., Arnell, N.W., Thompkins, E.L., Successful adaptation to climate change across scales (2005) Glob Environ Change, 15, pp. 77-86; Barlow, J., Peres, C.A., Ecological responses to El Niño-induced surface fires in central Brazilian Amazonia: Management implications for flammable tropical forests (2004) Phil Trans R Soc Lond B, 359, pp. 367-380; Bastien, Y., Aussenac, G., Frochot, H., Les changements climatiques: Conséquences pour la sylviculture (2000) Revue Forestière Française, 52, pp. 129-137; Blate, G.M., Modest tradeoffs between timber management and fire susceptibility of a Bolivian semi-deciduous forest (2005) Ecol App, 15, pp. 1649-1663; Boshier, D.H., Henson, M., Boshier, D.H., Lamb, A.T., Variación genética (1997) Cordia Alliodora.
